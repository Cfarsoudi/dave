FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2.


The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

THE GRANDFATHER

Suddenly passionate.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
             Chases. Escapes. True love.
             Miracles.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

                         THE KID
                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            5.


BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -hold it, hold it-

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             What is this? Are you trying to
             trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
             Is this a kissing book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             -- wait, just wait --

                         THE KID
             -- well, when does it get good?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for
             Buttercup --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen groaning)
             I don't be-leeve this.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen, perking
                  up a little)
             -- murdered by pirates is good --

CLOSE UP: Buttercup, staring out the window of her room.

                  (off-screen)
             She went into her room and shut
             the door. And for days, she
             neither slept nor ate.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (no emotion at all in
                  her voice)
             I will never love again.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,
livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as
             never before to hear the
             announcement of the great Prince
             Humperdinck's bride-to be.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,
standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three
others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the
aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the
Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (raises his hands,
                  starts to speak)
             My people ... a month from now,
             our country will have its 500th
             anniversary. On that sundown, I
             shall marry a lady who was once a
             commoner like yourselves --
                  (pause)
             -- but perhaps you will not find
             her common now. Would you like to
             meet her?

And the answering YESSSS booms like summer thunder.

A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just
begins to become visible,

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if
there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,
collectively, holds its breath.

                                            CUT TO:

THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is
Buttercup. And she resplendent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My people ... the Princess
             Buttercup!!

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no
instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great
waves of people kneeling and --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her
subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a
moment.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Buttercup's emptiness consumed
             her. Although the law of the land
             gave Humperdinck the right to
             choose his bride, she did not
             love him.

WOODLANDS

-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse
easily.

                  (off-screen)
             Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
             that she would grow to love him,
             the only joy she found was in her
             daily ride.

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

                                            CUT TO:

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

                         VIZZINI
             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

                                            CUT TO:

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Those are the Shrieking Eels.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             We're past that, Grandpa.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

treading water.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18.


A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.


And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25.


THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...

                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54.


Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66.


                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.

                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.


                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

                                            CUT TO:

A DIAL

with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50."
Rugen goes to it.

                         RUGEN

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes
from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as
we finally

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and
pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --
             how do you feel?

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while FEZZIK spoons him some
stew.

                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO

                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
             marry. Tomorrow morning, your men
             will escort us to Florin Channel
             where every ship in my armada
             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN

             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart

slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.


WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

                         RUGEN
             Not to fifty!!!

But it's too late as we --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows
and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

                                            CUT TO:

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.


                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...

As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2.


The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.
             Chases. Escapes. True love.
             Miracles.

THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed.

                         THE KID
                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

                  (off-screen)

THE KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             What is this? Are you trying to
             trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
             Is this a kissing book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             -- wait, just wait --

                         THE KID
             -- well, when does it get good?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for
             Buttercup --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen groaning)
             I don't be-leeve this.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

             She went into her room and shut
             the door. And for days, she
             neither slept nor ate.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (no emotion at all in
                  her voice)
             I will never love again.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,
livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

                  (off-screen reading)
             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as
             never before to hear the
             announcement of the great Prince
             Humperdinck's bride-to be.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,

Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if
there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,
collectively, holds its breath.

                                            CUT TO:

THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is
Buttercup. And she resplendent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My people ... the Princess
             Buttercup!!

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no
instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great
waves of people kneeling and --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her
subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a
moment.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Buttercup's emptiness consumed
             her. Although the law of the land
             gave Humperdinck the right to
             choose his bride, she did not
             love him.

                                            CUT TO:

WOODLANDS

-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse
easily.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Despite Humperdinck's reassurance
             that she would grow to love him,
             the only joy she found was in her
             daily ride.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            9.


A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

                                            CUT TO:

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

                         VIZZINI
             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

                                            CUT TO:

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

             We're past that, Grandpa.

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.

And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           29.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.

Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

                         GRANDFATHER
             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.

                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

                                            CUT TO:

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.


                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           71.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.

                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

A DIAL

Rugen goes to it.

                         RUGEN
             This being our first try, I'll
             use the lowest setting.

And he turns the dial to "1".

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens
the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

WESTLEY

and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the
chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes
from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as
we finally

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and
pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

                         RUGEN
             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --
             how do you feel?

AND NOW, AT LAST:

WESTLEY

in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries.

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

                         RUGEN
             Interesting.

in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all
over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in
the doorway.

             Yellin.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Any word from Westley?

THE PRINCE AND YELLIN

turning to her in the doorway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Too soon, my angel. Patience.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

                         HUMPERDINCK

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

stew.

                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO

                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS

                  (sharpening his dagger)
             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we

             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN
                  (bows, exits)
             Your Majesties.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring at Humperdinck.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           84.


                         BUTTERCUP
             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart
             full of fear.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (close to erupting;
                  speaks very distinctly)
             I-would-not-say-such things-if-
             Iwere-you-

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why not? You can't hurt me.
             Westley and I are joined by the
             bonds of love. And you cannot
             track that. Not with a thousand
             bloodhounds. And you cannot break
             it. Not with a thousand swords.
             And when I say you are a coward,
             that is only because you are the
             slimiest weakling ever to crawl
             the earth.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull
her along, out of control, his words indistinct.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU!

                                            CUT TO:

A CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE

as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room,
slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.


WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

                         RUGEN
             Not to fifty!!!

But it's too late as we --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows
and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

                                            CUT TO:

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing
CLERGYMAN imaginable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103.


Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.


                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123.


As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

BIALYSTOCK NODS HIS HEAD IN ASSENT.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Good.  Let's fool around.  Now,
            I'll be the innocent little milk
            maid and you'll be the naughty
            stable boy.
                   (she goes into her act)
            Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll
            never reach the house.  Help.  Will
            someone help me?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (stopping her)
            Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today.
            I have too many appointments.

            Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa
            and the chauffeur.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, the best one.

            So, the Count hired you this

            ... Watch the road.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I can't take my eyes off you.  How
            can I drive when you drive me mad.
            Mad.

            Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (upright)
            Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the
            rest on Thursday.
                   (he reaches down and
                   helps her off the couch)
            That's a good girl.
                   (leading her to the door)
            It's always such fun to see you.

BIALYSTOCK OPENS THE DOOR AND USHERS HER OUT ONTO THE LANDING.

CUT TO HALLWAY.  FAR SHOT.  REVEALING BLOOM WAITING OUTSIDE.
WE SEE HIM.  THEY DO NOT.  BLOOM, VERY EMBARRASSED, HUGS THE
WALL TRYING TO MAKE HIMSELF LESS CONSPICUOUS.

MEDIUM SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY IN FRONT OF
BIALYSTOCK'S DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Until Thursday, then, you bawdy
            wench.

HE SLAPS HER ON THE RUMP.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.

CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS, AGHAST.

BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            And we'll finish playing the
            Contessa and Rudolfo.

                                                            9.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Good.  Yes.  Thursday.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            And after that we'll play the
            Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia
            ... And I'll play Lucretia.

CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS.  IT IS ALL TOO MUCH FOR HIM.  HE
LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.  SUDDENLY HIS EYES WIDEN IN SURPRISE,
AS HE DISCOVERS ANOTHER MAN HIDING IN THE NEXT DOORWAY.  THE
MAN PUTS A FINGER TO HIS LIPS INDICATING SILENCE.  THERE IS
NO PLACE LEFT FOR BLOOM TO LOOK.  HE LOOKS TO HEAVEN.

BACK TO LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, Thursday.  Will Thursday ever
            come?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            Like clockwork.

SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            I shall count the minutes.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!
                   (calling after her)
            Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ...
            Lucretia, Lucretia!

WE HEAR A MOUNTING CLATTER OF FOOTSTEPS AS THE LITTLE OLD
LADY FLIES BACK UP THE STAIRS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (eagerly)
            Yes???

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give
            me the check.  Can't produce a play
            without money, ha, ha, ha.

CUT TO BLOOM.  ONCE MORE HE STEALS A GLANCE AT THE STRANGER
HIDDEN IN THE SECOND DOORWAY.  ONCE AGAIN THE MAN GESTURES
FOR HIM TO BE SILENT.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY.

                                                           10.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (opening her handbag
                   and reaching inside)
            Of course, the check, I had it with
            me all the time.

SHE TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND HANDS IT TO HIM.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            I don't know what's happening to me.
            I must be getting old.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES CHECK AND READS IT.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Is it all right?  I made it out to
            cash.  You didn't tell me the name
            of the play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good.
            Bye.  Bye.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall
            count the minutes.

SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (descending)
            Ta.  Ta.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (waving check at her)
            Ta.  Ta.

THE MAN, WHO HAS BEEN LURKING IN THE SECOND DOORWAY, SUDDENLY
SPRINGS INTO ACTION.  HE DARTS FORWARD AND QUICKLY TAKES THE
CHECK OUT OF BIALYSTOCK'S HAND.

                         THE MAN (LANDLORD)
            He who signs a lease, must pay rent.

HE SHOVES THE CHECK INTO HIS POCKET AND STARTS DOWN THE
STAIRS.

                         LANDLORD
            That's the law.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Murderer!  Thief!  How can you take
            the last penny out of a man's pocket?

                                                           11.


                         LANDLORD
                   (turns back, shrugs)
            I have to ... I'm a landlord!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting to heaven)
            Oh Lord, hear my plea.  Destroy him.
            He maketh a blight on the land.

CUT TO LANDLORD ON THE WAY DOWN.

                         LANDLORD
                   (to the Lord)
            Don't pay attention.  He's crazy.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE TURNS TO RE-ENTER HIS OFFICE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (biting his knuckle)
            Nnnnn.  That hurt.
                   (he sighs)
            I'll have to make another call.

HE STARTS IN AND STOPS.  HE NOTICES BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom, quietly)
            Have you been there all this time?

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And did you see and hear everything?

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then what do you have to say for
            yourself?

                         BLOOM
            Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouts)
            Who are you?  What do you want?
            Why are you loitering in my hallway?
            Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you
            speak?

                         BLOOM
            Scared.  Can't talk.

                                                           12.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            All right.  Get a hold of yourself.
            Take a deep breath, let it out
            slowly and tell me who you are.

                         BLOOM
                   (breathes deeply.
                   Words tumble from his
                   mouth as he exhales)
            I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant,
            I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was
            sent here to do your books and I'm
            terribly sorry I caught you with
            the old lady.
                   (he has run out of breath)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Caught you with the old lady."
            Come in, Mr. Tact.

CUT TO OFFICE.  THEY ENTER.  BLOOM ENTERS TIMOROUSLY.  HE
DOESN'T KNOW QUITE WHERE TO GO.  HE LOOKS TO BIALYSTOCK FOR
GUIDANCE.  BIALYSTOCK STUDIES BLOOM CURIOUSLY FROM HEAD TO
TOE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So you're an accountant, eh?

                         BLOOM
                   (timidly)
            Yes sir.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then account for yourself!  Do you
            believe in God?  Do you believe in
            gold?  Why are you looking up old
            lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert,
            eh?

BLOOM, WHO HAS BEEN QUAKING UNDER THE ASSAULT, REACHES INTO
HIS POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE TATTERED CORNER OF AN OLD BLUE
BABY BLANKET.  HE TWISTS THE BLUE BLANKET NERVOUSLY IN HIS
HANDS.

                         BLOOM
            Sir, I ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Never mind.  Never mind.  Do the
            books.  They're in that desk over
            there.  Top drawer.

                                                           13.


BLOOM DUTIFULLY GOES TO DESK.  OPENS TOP DRAWER AND BEGINS
REMOVING BOOKS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How dare you condemn me without
            knowing all the facts.

                         BLOOM
            But sir, I'm not condem ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical
            conversation.
                   (to himself)
            How humiliating.  Max Bialystock.
            Max Bialystock.

BIALYSTOCK SUDDENLY WHEELS AND SHOUTS AT BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You know who I used to be?  Max
            Bialystock!  The King of Broadway!
            Six shows running at once.  Lunch
            at Delmonico's.  Two hundred dollar
            suits.  Look at me.  Look at me now!
            I'm wearing a cardboard belt!

HE RIPS THE BELT OFF AND HOLDS IT IN THE AIR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I used to have thousands of
            investors begging, pleading, to put
            their money into a Max Bialystock
            production.

HE PICKS UP THE PICTURE ON DESK ('HOLD ME, TOUCH ME') TAKES
IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR PICTURES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Look at my investors now.  Voila!
                   (gestures at pictures)
            Hundreds of little old ladies
            stopping off at Max Bialystock's
            office to grab a last thrill on the
            way to the cemetery.

HE PUTS PICTURE BACK IN ITS PLACE.  LOOKS TOWARD BLOOM.

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED BY THE GREAT MAN'S
DILEMMA.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.

                                                           14.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You have exactly ten seconds to
            change that disgusting look of pity
            into one of enormous respect.  One
            ... Two ...

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do the books!  Do the books!

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS GREATLY RELIEVED.

                         BLOOM
                   (sighing)
            Yes, sir.  Thank you.

HE PLUNGES INTO HIS WORK.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE GOES TO WINDOW, LOOKS OUT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            Window's so filthy, can't tell if
            it's day or night out there.

HE WIPES WINDOW WITH HIS CUFF.  LOOKS AT WINDOW.  NO GOOD.
LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF.  GRIMACES.  FROM HIS DESK HE TAKES
THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES
IT AGAINST THE WINDOW.  HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE.  HE LOOKS
OVER HIS SHOULDER AT BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING.  BLOOM
IS WATCHING.  THEIR EYES MEET.  BLOOM'S EYES RETREAT.
BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW
DOWN INTO THE STREET.

CAMERA:  SHOT OF STREET.  BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW.  A
WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (voice over as camera
                   follows Rolls)
            Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce.
            That's it baby, when you got it,
            flaunt it.

                         BLOOM
                   (off screen)
            Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ...
            harrumph ...

                                                           15.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            I assume you are making those
            cartoon noises to attract my
            attention.  Am I correct in my
            assumption, you fish-faced enemy of
            the people?

BLOOM IS WOUNDED.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I have hurt your feelings.

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Good, what is it?

                         BLOOM
            Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (looking at his watch)
            Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.

                         BLOOM
            Well, sir, it seems ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            You have forty-eight seconds left.
            Hurry.  Hurry.

                         BLOOM
                   (speedily)
            In looking at your books, I've
            discovered that ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry,
            you're using up your time.

IN HIS ANXIETY, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET
TAKES OUT THE OLD BLUE BLANKET AND NERVOUSLY STROKES HIS
CHEEK WITH IT.

                         BLOOM
            Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function
            under these conditions.

BIALYSTOCK CURIOUSLY EYES THE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            You're making me extremely nervous.

                                                           16.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            What is that?  A handkerchief?

BLOOM QUICKLY BEGINS TO PUT AWAY HIS BLUE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            It's nothing ... nothing.

QUICK AS A FLASH, BIALYSTOCK REACHES OVER AND SNATCHES IT
OUT OF BLOOM'S HAND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            If it's nothing, why can't I see it?

BLOOM LEAPS UP IN HOT PURSUIT OF HIS BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
                   (shrieking in panic)
            My blanket.  Give me my blue blanket.

BIALYSTOCK, TAKEN ABACK, HURRIEDLY GIVES THE BLANKET BACK TO
BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here, don't panic.

                         BLOOM
                   (clutching his blanket)
            I'm sorry ... I don't like people
            touching my blue blanket.  It's not
            important.  It's a minor compulsion.
            I can deal with it if I want to.
            It's just that I've had it ever
            since I was a baby and ... and ...
            I find it very comforting.

HE KISSES IT AND SHOVES IT INTO HIS POCKET.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            They come here.  They all come here.
            How do they find me?

                         BLOOM
                   (recovering his dignity)
            Mr. Bialystock ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do
            for you?

                                                           17.


                         BLOOM
            This is hardly a time for levity.
            I've discovered a serious error
            here in the accounts of your last
            play.

BIALYSTOCK MOVES AROUND THE DESK TO EXAMINE THE LEDGER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Where?  What?

                         BLOOM
            According to the backer's list you
            raised $60,000.  But the show you
            produced only cost fifty-eight
            thousand.  There's two thousand
            dollars unaccounted for.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I went to a Turkish bath, who cares?
            The show was a flop.  What
            difference does it make?

                         BLOOM
            It makes a great deal of difference.
            That's fraud.  If they found out,
            you could go to prison.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why should they find out?  It's
            only two thousand dollars,  Bloom,
            do me a favor, move a few decimal
            points around.  You can do it.
            You're an accountant.  The word
            'count' is part of your title.

                         BLOOM
                   (aghast)
            But that's cheating!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's not cheating ... It's charity.
            Bloom, look at me ... look at me!
            I'm drowning.  Other men sail
            through life.  Bialystock has
            struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going
            under.  I am being sunk by a
            society that demands success, when
            all I can offer is failure.  Bloom,
            I'm reaching out to you.  Don't
            send me to jail.  Help!  Help!

                                                           18.


DURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES
INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT
ACROSS HIS CHEEK.

                         BLOOM
            Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (faintly)
            Help!

                         BLOOM
            All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could
            con you.

                         BLOOM
            Oh, it's all right ... wha?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.

                         BLOOM
                   (pouring over the accounts)
            Now let's see, two thousand dollars.
            That isn't much.  I'm sure I can
            hide it somewhere.  After all, the
            department of internal revenue
            isn't interested in a show that
            flopped.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You
            figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm
            gonna take a little nap.
                   (crossing to couch)
            Wake me if there's a fire.

HE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH.

CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
            Now let's see, if we add these
            figures, we get ...

CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING
DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES.  HE COMES TO THE END AND
IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW.

BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.  HE COMPARES PAGES.

                                                           19.


                         BLOOM
                   (musing to himself)
            Heh, heh, heh, amazing.  It's
            absolutely amazing.  But under the
            right circumstances, a producer
            could make more money with a flop
            than he could with a hit.

QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE.  HIS EYES POP OPEN.

CUT BACK TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
            Yes.  Yes.  It's quite possible.
            If he were certain the show would
            fail, a man could make a fortune.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM.
HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS.  HE MOVES TO
BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR
MORE INFORMATION.  BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE
THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes???

BLOOM LOOKS UP.  HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO
CLOSE TO HIS OWN.

                         BLOOM
                   (at a loss)
            Yes, what?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What you were saying.  Keep talking.

                         BLOOM
            What was I saying?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You were saying that under the
            right circumstances, a producer
            could make more money with a flop
            than he could with a hit.

                         BLOOM
                   (smiling)
            Yes, it's quite possible.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You keep saying that, but you don't
            tell me how.  How could a producer
            make more money with a flop than
            with a hit?

                                                           20.


BLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES
BIALYSTOCK.  HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A
STUDENT.

                         BLOOM
            It's simply a matter of creative
            accounting.  Let us assume, just
            for the moment, that you are a
            dishonest man.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Assume away!

                         BLOOM
            Well, it's very easy.  You simply
            raise more money than you really
            need.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What do you mean?

                         BLOOM
            You've done it yourself, only you
            did it on a very small scale.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What did I do?

                         BLOOM
            You raised two thousand more than
            you needed to produce your last play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So what?  What did it get me?  I'm
            wearing a cardboard belt.

                         BLOOM
            Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made
            your error.  You didn't go all the
            way.  You see, if you were really a
            bold criminal, you could have
            raised a million.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            But the play only cost $60,000 to
            produce.

                         BLOOM
            Exactly.  And how long did it run?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            One night.

                                                           21.


                         BLOOM
            See?  You could have raised a
            million dollars, put on a sixty
            thousand dollar flop and kept the
            rest.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            But what if the play was a hit?

                         BLOOM
            Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play
            were a hit, you'd have to pay off
            the backers, and with so many
            backers there could never be enough
            profits to go around, get it?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So,
            in order for the scheme to work,
            we'd have to find a sure fire flop.

                         BLOOM
            What scheme?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What scheme?  Your scheme, you
            bloody little genius.

                         BLOOM
            Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no
            scheme.  I merely posed a little,
            academic accounting theory.  It's
            just a thought.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bloom, worlds are turned on such
            thoughts!

BIALYSTOCK STARTS MOVING IN ON BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Don't you see, Bloom.  Darling,
            Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so
            simple.  Step one:  We find the
            worst play in the world -- a sure
            flop.  Step two:  I raise a million
            dollars -- there's a lot of little
            old ladies in this world.  Step
            three:  You go back to work on the
            books.  Phoney lists of backers --
            one for the government, one for us.
            You can do it, Bloom, you're a
            wizard.
                         (MORE)

                                                           22.


                         BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
            Step four:  We open on Broadway and
            before you can say 'step five' we
            close on Broadway.  Step six:  We
            take our million dollars and fly to
            Rio de Janiero.

BIALYSTOCK GRABS BLOOM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGINS TO LEAD HIM IN
A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (sings)
            "Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo,
            myo, meo ... "

                         BLOOM
                   (afraid of the
                   scheme, afraid of the
                   dance, afraid of Bialystock)
            Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please.
            You're holding me too tight.  I'm
            an honest man.  You don't understand.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (leading Bloom as he talks)
            No, Bloom, you don't understand.
            This is fate, this is destiny.
            There's no avoiding it.

AT THIS POINT, BIALYSTOCK SWEEPS BLOOM INTO AN ELABORATE DIP.

                         BLOOM
                   (the back of his head
                   practically touching
                   the floor)
            Mr. Bialystock, not more than five
            minutes ago, against my better
            judgment, I doctored your books.
            That, sir, is the ultimate extent
            of my criminal life.

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS FISTS TO THE HEAVENS IN DESPAIR.
BLOOM, EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT, GOES CRASHING
TO THE FLOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!
            OOOOOHH!  I WANT THAT MONEY!

CAMERA ON BLOOM AS HE LIES STRICKEN ON THE FLOOR.

                                                           23.


                         BLOOM
                   (to himself)
            Oh, I fell on my keys.
                   (he shifts slightly
                   to make himself more comfortable)
            I've got to get out of here.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (angrily hovering
                   over Bloom)
            You miserable, cowardly, wretched
            little caterpillar.  Don't you ever
            want to become a butterfly?  Don't
            you want to spread your wings and
            flap your way to glory?

BIALYSTOCK FLAPS HIS ARMS LIKE A HUGE PREDATORY BIRD.

                         BLOOM
                   (his eyes widened in terror)
            You're going to jump on me.

BIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY.

                         BLOOM
            You're going to jump on me.  I know
            you're going to jump on me -- like
            Nero jumped on Poppea.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (nonplussed)
            What???

                         BLOOM
                   (by now he is shrieking)
            Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she
            was unfaithful to him.  So he got
            mad and he jumped on her.  Up and
            down, up and down, until he squashed
            her like a bug.  Please don't jump
            on me.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting and jumping
                   up and down next to Bloom)
            I'm not going to jump on you!

                         BLOOM
                   (rolling away in terror)
            Aaaaaaaaaa!

                                                           24.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (hoisting Bloom to
                   his feet)
            Will you get a hold on yourself.

                         BLOOM
                   (up on his feet and
                   running for cover)
            Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!

HE RUNS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM.  TRAPPED!  HE TURNS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you afraid of?  I'm not
            going to hurt you!  What's the
            matter with you?

                         BLOOM
            I'm hysterical.  I'm having
            hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I
            can't stop.  When I get like this,
            I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK.  PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER
AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE.

                         BLOOM
            I'm wet!  I'm wet!  I'm hysterical
            and I'm wet!

BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS,
SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

                         BLOOM
                   (holding his face)
            I'm in pain!  And I'm wet!  And I'm
            still hysterical!

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN.

                         BLOOM
            No!  No!  Don't hit.  It doesn't
            help.  It only increases my sense
            of danger.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What can I do?  What can I do?
            You're getting me hysterical.

                         BLOOM
            Go away from me.  You frighten me.
                   (he indicates the sofa)
            Sit over there.

                                                           25.


BIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (exasperated)
            Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that
            better?

                         BLOOM
            It's a little better, but you still
            look angry.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How's this?
                   (he smiles sweetly)


                         BLOOM
            Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's
            very nice.  I think I'm coming out
            of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm
            definitely coming out of it.  Thank
            you for smiling.  It helped a great
            deal.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (for want of something
                   sensible)
            Well, you know what they say,
            "Smile and the world smiles with
            you."  Heh, heh.
                   (to himself)
            The man should be in a straight
            jacket.
                   (to Bloom)
            Feeling better?

                         BLOOM
            Much, thank you.  But I am a little
            lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat
            something.  Hysterics have a way of
            severely depleting one's blood
            sugar, you know.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They certainly do.  They certainly
            do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.

                         BLOOM
            That's very kind of you, Mr.
            Bialystock, but I ...

                                                           26.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy.  I
            lowered your blood sugar, but least
            I could do is raise it a little.

BLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And I promise you faithfully, I
            won't discuss that silly scheme to
            make a million dollars anymore.

BIALYSTOCK DONS HIS CAPE AND "BELASCO" HAT.  FROM A RACK HE
SELECTS A GOLD-TOPPED WALKING STICK.  HE GOES TO DOOR, OPENS
IT, AND WITH A GRAND FLOURISH, MOTIONS BLOOM TO PRECEDE HIM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Avanti!

BLOOM GRACIOUSLY COMPLIES.  THEY EXIT.

CUT TO EXTERIOR.  ENTRANCE OF BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE BUILDING.

THE DOOR OPENS.  IT IS HELD BY BIALYSTOCK.  BLOOM EXITS
BUILDING INTO STREET.

                         BLOOM
                   (to Bialystock, who
                   is holding door)
            Thank you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Je vous empris.

THEY TURN UP 45TH STREET AND HEAD TOWARD BROADWAY.
BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND COUNTS HIS MONEY.  HE
LOOKS WORRIED.  SUDDENLY HIS FACE BRIGHTENS.

WE SEE WHAT BIALYSTOCK SEES.

CUT TO MURRAY THE BLINDMAN WORKING 45TH STREET.

CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

BIALYSTOCK DROPS A STEP BEHIND, QUICKLY TAKES OFF HIS HAT
AND FLINGS IT THROUGH THE AIR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (pointing to his hat)
            My hat.

                         BLOOM
            I'll get it.

                                                           27.


HE RACES AFTER IT.

BIALYSTOCK DETOURS SLIGHTLY TOWARD MURRAY THE BLINDMAN, WHO
WEARS A LARGE CARDBOARD SIGN WITH THE LEGEND: "MURRAY THE
BLINDMAN.  YOU CAN SEE.  I CAN'T.  GIVE!"  INSCRIBED ON IT.
BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN INTO HIS CUP AND GRABS A FIST FULL
OF COINS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Murray, I'm going to lunch.  I took
            two dollars.

                         MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
            Okay, Bialy, that makes six eighty
            you owe me.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I know.  Don't worry.  You'll get
            it.  You'll get it.

                         MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
                   (tapping his way along)
            Well, don't forget about it.  I
            need it.  Nobody understands.  I'm
            competing with giants.  The Greater
            New York Fund.  The March of Dimes.
            The Community Chest.  They're
            driving me out of business.

BLOOM COMES DASHING BACK WITH HAT IN HAND.

                         BLOOM
                   (out of breath)
            I got it, Mr. Bialystock.

HE PROFFERS HAT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK TAKES IT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max.
            You know, I don't let everybody
            call me Max.  It's only people I
            really like.

                         BLOOM
                   (trying it on)
            Okay ... Max!  And you can call me
            Leo.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I already have.  Come on.

                         BLOOM
            Oh.

                                                           28.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Where would you like to eat?

                         BLOOM
            Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What
            do you think, Max?

BIALYSTOCK QUIETLY WINCES AT THE SURFEIT OF MAX.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Let me see ... it's such a beautiful
            day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've
            got it!  Let's go to Coney Island!
            We'll lunch at the sea shore.

                         BLOOM
            Coney Island??

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you
            like Coney Island?

                         BLOOM
            I ... I love it.  I haven't been
            there since I was a kid.  But it's
            nearly two o'clock.  I really
            should be getting back to Whitehall
            and Marks.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and
            Marks are concerned, you're working
            with Bialystock, right?

                         BLOOM
            Right.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then stick with Bialystock!

SWISH PAN CUT TO CONEY ISLAND.

FAR SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AMIDST THE CROWD AT A
CUSTARD STAND.

CAMERA ZOOMS IN.  TWO SHOT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Custard Man)
            We'll have another round.

                         CUSTARD MAN
            What kind now, sports?

                                                           29.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            What kind now, Leo?

                         BLOOM
                   (he's loosening up)
            I don't know.  Let's see.  We've
            had chocolate, vanilla, banana -
            let's go green.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Custard Man)
            Two pistachios, my good man.

                         CUSTARD MAN
            I'm not your good man, I happen to
            own this establishment.
                   (he turns to fill the order)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Everybody's a big shot.
                   (turns to Bloom)
            Well, Leo, are you having a good
            time?

                         BLOOM
            I don't know.  I think so.  I feel
            very strange.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Maybe you're happy.

                         BLOOM
            Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well,
            whatta ya think of that.  Happy.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ON THE WHIP (A CONEY
ISLAND RIDE).  THEY ARE TIGHTLY SQUEEZED INTO ONE OF THE
MOVING SEATS.  THEY ARE BETWEEN "WHIPS".

                         BLOOM
                   (licking his pistachio
                   custard.  He is ecstatic)
            I love it.  I love it.  Get set.
            We're coming to another turn.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (working, relentlessly
                   working on Bloom)
            Bloom, it can always be like this.
            Life can be beautiful.  Let me show
            you.  Stick with ...

THEY HIT THE TURN.

                                                           30.

            Bialysto-o-o-o-ckk.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BARKER SELLING TICKETS IN FRONT OF TUNNEL
OF LOVE.  MEDIUM SHOT OF EXIT.  A LITTLE BOAT COMES OUT.  IN
IT ARE A MAN AND A WOMAN EMBRACING.  IT IS FOLLOWED BY
ANOTHER.  IN IT THERE IS A SAILOR KISSING A GIRL.  BOAT
NUMBER THREE COMES OUT.  IN IT ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

CLOSE IN TO A TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BLOOM IS MESMERIZED.
BIALYSTOCK SPEAKS IN A SOFT, ENCHANTING TONE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Money is honey.  Money is honey.
            Money can put soft things next to
            your skin.  Silk ... satin ... women.

CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S EYES.  THEY WIDEN ON THE WORD "WOMEN."

QUICK DISSOLVE TO PARACHUTE JUMP.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE
SEATED IN A LITTLE GONDOLA THAT SWINGS BENEATH A HUGE
PARACHUTE.  THEY ARE BUCKLING THEMSELVES IN.

                         BLOOM
            But if we're caught, we'll go to
            prison.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (sensing victory, he
                   marshals his forces
                   for the final assault)
            You think you're not in prison now?
            Living in a grey little room.
            Going to a grey little job.  Leading
            a grey little life.

                         BLOOM
            You're right.  You're absolutely
            right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my
            life counting other people's
            money -- people I'm smarter than,
            better than.  Where's my share?
            Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want,
            I want, I want, I want everything
            I've ever seen in the movies!

THE PARACHUTE BEGINS TO ASCEND.  WE FOLLOW.

                         BLOOM
                   (coming out of it)
            Hey, we're going up.

                                                           31.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You bet your boots, Leo.  It's
            Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise.
            Upward and onward.  Say, you'll
            join me.  Nothing can stop us.

BIALYSTOCK OFFERS HIS HAND TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (shouting at the top
                   of his lungs)
            I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!

BLOOM GRABS BIALYSTOCK'S HAND AND SHAKES IT FIRMLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            This is where we belong, Leo.  On
            top of the world.  Top of the world!

THEY HIT THE TOP.  THE PARACHUTE IS RELEASED, THEY QUICKLY
PLUMMET DOWN.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oiiiiiii!!!

                         BLOOM
            Ohhhhhhhh!!!

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM DROP OUT OF FRAME.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.  NIGHT.  OVERHEAD SHOT.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE BATHED IN A SMALL POOL OF
CONCENTRATED LIGHT.  THEY ARE DOWN TO THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES.
THEY ARE FEVERISHLY READING PLAY MANUSCRIPTS.  ALL ABOUT
THEM ARE STREWN COFFEE CONTAINERS, SOME EMPTY, SOME HALF-
FILLED.  THERE IS A HUGE PILE OF DISCARDED SCRIPTS ON THE
FLOOR.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LEO BLOOM AS HE READS SCRIPT.  HE LOOKS
UP, PUSHES HIS GLASSES BACK AND MASSAGES THE BRIDGE OF HIS
NOSE.

                         BLOOM
            Max, let's call it a night.  It's
            two in the morning.  I don't know
            what I'm reading anymore.

PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Read, read.  We've got to find the
            worst play ever written.

                                                           32.


BIALYSTOCK TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO A NEW SCRIPT.  HE CRACKS
IT OPEN AND BEGINS READING.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Hmmnn.  "Gregor Samsa awoke one
            morning to find he had been
            transformed into a giant cock-a-
            roach."

IN A RAGE BIALYSTOCK FLINGS THE MANUSCRIPT ONTO THE PILE OF
DISCARDS AS HE BELLOWS:

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's good!!!

CAMERA MOVES UP AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO MEDIUM SHOT OF
OFFICE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE THOROUGHLY DISHEVELED AND
BADLY IN NEED OF A SHAVE.

                         BLOOM
                   (mumbling to himself
                   as he reads)
            Wait a minute, I've read this part.
            I'm reading plays I read this
            morning.

HE GETS UP, STRETCHES, GOES TO WINDOW AND RAISES SHADE.
SUNLIGHT FLOODS THE ROOM.  HE REELS BACK AS THOUGH STRUCK.

                         BLOOM
            Good lord, it's morning.  Let's
            face it, we'll never find it.
                   (he turns to face Bialystock)
            Max, tomorrow's another day.
            Today's another day.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (off-camera.  Crazy
                   little voice)
            We'll never find it, eh?  We'll
            never find it, eh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha,
            ha.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE IS STANDING.  AT HIS FEET LIES A
SCRIPT.  HE DANCES AROUND IT, HIS ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HIS
CHEST.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (as he does an insane
                   little jig around the script)
            You can't smell it when it's under
            your nose.  You can't see it when
            it's right before your eyes.
                         (MORE)

                                                           33.


                         BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
            You can't feel it when it's in your
            hand, when it's in your pocket.

CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT.

                         BLOOM
            Max, what is it?  What are you
            doing?  What's happening?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'll tell you what's happening.
            We've struck gold.  Not fool's
            gold, but real gold.  The mother
            lode.  The mother lode.  The mother
            of them all.

                         BLOOM
                   (brightening)
            You found a flop!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            A flop, ha!  That's putting it
            mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe!
            An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close-
            in-one-night beauty!

HE BENDS DOWN, PICKS UP THE SCRIPT AND SHAKES IT IN BLOOM'S
FACE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            This is freedom from want forever.
            This is a house in the country.
            This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley.
            This is wine, women and song and
            women.

BLOOM SNATCHES THE SCRIPT FROM HIS HANDS AND READS ALOUD THE
TITLE.

DISSOLVE THROUGH AUTHOR'S NAME TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM,
SHAVED AND DAPPER, WALKING DOWN STREET IN A RUN-DOWN TENEMENT
NEIGHBORHOOD.

                         BLOOM
            Here it is -- 415.

THEY MARCH UP STOOP TO NUMBER 415.  THEIR MOTION IS ARRESTED
BY A QUERULOUS COMMAND ISSUED IN PHLEGMATIC TONES BY THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE BUILDING (A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES)
WHO IS LEANING OUT OF HER WINDOW WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE
STOOP.

                         SUPER
            Who do you want?

                         BLOOM
                   (taken aback)
            I beg your pardon?

                         SUPER
            Who do you want?  No one gets in
            the building unless I know who they
            want ... I'm the concierge.  My
            husband used to be the concierge.
            He's dead.  Now I'm the concierge.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (imperiously)
            We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind.

                         SUPER
            Oh, the kraut.  He's on the top
            floor.  Apartment twenty-three.

                         BLOOM
            Thank you.

THEY START INTO THE BUILDING.

                                                           35.


                         SUPER
            But you won't find him there.  He's
            up on the roof with his birds.  He
            keeps birds.  Dirty, disgusting,
            filthy, lice-ridden birds.  You
            used to be able to sit out on the
            stoop like a person.  Not anymore.
            No sir.  Birds!  You get my drift?

                         BLOOM
            We ... uh ... get your drift.
            Thank you, Madam.

                         SUPER
            I'm not a madam.  I'm a concierge.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE BUILDING.

CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FORTIES.  HE IS
WEARING, AS ALWAYS, A GERMAN HELMET.  HE CROUCHES BESIDE A
HUGE PIGEON COOP.  IN HIS LEFT HAND HE TENDERLY HOLDS A
PIGEON.  IN HIS RIGHT, A SMALL PHOTO OF ADOLPH HITLER.  HE
SHOWS THE PICTURE TO THE BIRD.  HE MOVES IT BACK AND FORTH
UNTIL HE IS SURE THE BIRD IS FOCUSED ON IT PROPERLY.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to pigeon)
            Hilda, look ... look good ...
            Hilda, you're not looking.  Hilda,
            if he lives, I know you will find
            him.

HE KISSES THE BIRD AND TOSSES IT SKYWARD.

CUT TO ROOF DOOR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER ONTO THE ROOF.
THEY LOOK FOR LIEBKIND.  HE IS NOT ON THAT SIDE OF ROOF.
THEY WALK AROUND TO OTHER SIDE.  AS SOON AS THEY TURN THE
CORNER, THEY SPOT LIEBKIND CROUCHED NEAR THE COOP.

                         BLOOM
                   (quietly to Bialystock)
            He's wearing a German helmet.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a fierce whisper)
            Shhh.  Don't say anything to offend
            him.  We need that play.
                   (cups his hands to
                   his mouth and calls
                   up to the coop)
            Franz Liebkind?

LIEBKIND IS NOT AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE UNTIL HE HEARS HIS
NAME CALLED.

                                                           36.


STARTLED, HE QUICKLY FLIPS HITLER'S PICTURE UNDER HIS HELMET.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (he speaks with a
                   German accent)
            I vas never a member of the Nazi
            party.  I am not responsible.  I
            only followed orders.  Who are you?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't
            understand.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers
            are in order.  I love my country.
                   (he sings)
            "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,
            For amber vaves of grain."

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Mr. Liebkind, wait ...

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing)
            "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're
            not from the government.  We came
            here to talk to you about your play.

                         LIEBKIND
            My play?  You mean, "Springtime For
            ... " you know who?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vat about it?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We loved it.  We thought it was a
            masterpiece.  That's why we're here.
            We want to produce it on Broadway.

                         LIEBKIND
            You're not, as you Americans say,
            dragging my leg, are you?

                                                           37.


                         BLOOM
            No, not at all sir, we're quite
            serious.  We want to produce your
            play.
                   (he reaches into his
                   attache case and
                   displays a legal
                   looking document)
            I have the contracts right here.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (looking up)
            Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of
            dreams!  I can't believe it.
                   (he turns to the pigeons)
            Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto,
            Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do
            you hear?  Ve are going to clear
            the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly,
            spread the words.

HE OPENS THE CAGES AND SETS THE BIRDS FREE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing at the top
                   of his lungs)
            "Deutchland, Deutchland, uber
            alles, Uber alles in der velt."

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN ALARM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing for all he's worth)
            "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "

                         BLOOM
                   (shouting)
            Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.

LIEBKIND STOPS SINGING.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vat?

                         BLOOM
            People can hear you.

                         LIEBKIND
            OH.
                   (he sings)
            "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee
            Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is
            not place to talk.  Come!

                         LIEBKIND (CONT'D)
            We go to my flat.  An occasion like
            this calls for Schnapps.

DISSOLVE TO FRANZ LIEBKIND'S APARTMENT.  LIEBKIND HAS JUST
FINISHED POURING THREE GLASSES OF SCHNAPPS.  HE PUTS THE
BOTTLE ON A TRAY.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (as he hands glasses
                   to Bialystock and Bloom)
            Mr. Bloom, Mr. Bialystock.
            Gentleman, with your permission, I
            would like to propose a toast to
            the greatest man that ever lived.
            Let us say his name quietly to
            ourselves.  The walls have ears.

BACK TO SCENE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I vas vit him a great deal, you know.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            With whom?

                                                           39.


                         LIEBKIND
                   (astonished by the question)
            Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He
            liked me.  Out of all the household
            staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his
            favorite.  I vas the only one
            allowed into his chambers at bedtime.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No kidding?

                         LIEBKIND
            Oh, sure.  I used to take him his
            hot milk and his opium.  Achhh,
            those were the days.  Vat good
            times ve had.  Dinner parties vit
            lovely ladies and gentlemen,
            singing und dancing.  You know, not
            many people knew about it, but the
            Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Really, I never dreamed ...

                         LIEBKIND
                   (flies into an
                   indignant rage)
            That's because you were taken in by
            that verdampter Allied propaganda.
            Such filthy lies.  But nobody said
            a bad vord about Winston Churchill,
            did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!
                   (he gestures V for victory)
            Churchill, vit his cigars and his
            brandy and his rotten paintings.
            Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would
            say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not
            Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me
            tell this, and you're getting it
            straight from the horse, Hitler vas
            better looking than Churchill, he
            vas a better dresser than Churchill,
            had more hair, told funnier jokes,
            and could dance the pants off
            Churchill!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (swinging along)
            That's exactly why we want to do
            this play.  To show the world the
            true Hitler, the Hitler you knew,
            the Hitler you loved, the Hitler
            with a song in his heart.

                   (to Bloom)
            Leo, quick, the contract.

BLOOM QUICKLY WHIPS THE CONTRACT OUT OF HIS POCKET, PRODUCES
A PEN, HANDS THEM TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK SPREADS THE
CONTRACT OUT ON THE TABLE BEFORE LIEBKIND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind.
            And make your dream a reality.

HE HANDS LIEBKIND THE PEN.  LIEBKIND REFUSES IT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Wait.  No.  How do I know I can
            trust you?  How do I know you vill
            present this play in the manner and
            spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We swear it!

                         LIEBKIND
            Not good enough... Vould you be
            villing to take the Siegfried oath?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  We would!

INSERT:  CLOSE-UP BLOOM.  HE LOOKS WORRIED.

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  I will make the preparations.

LIEBKIND LEAVES THE ROOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (anxious whisper)
            Max, I don't want to take any
            Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what
            it is, but I don't want to take it.
            We might end up in the German Army.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless
            nut.  Play along with him.  It's
            almost in the bag.

LIEBKIND ENTERS.  HE IS LADEN DOWN WITH ALL SORTS OF
RITUALISTIC PARAPHERNALIA.  LIEBKIND PLACES ALL THE STUFF ON
THE TABLE.  WITHOUT A WORD TO THEM, HE GOES TO PHONOGRAPH.

                                                           41.


IN A FEW SECONDS WE HEAR THE OPENING STRAINS OF WAGNER'S
"RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES."  AS THE MUSIC BOOMS LOUDER, LIEBKIND
ADDRESSES THEM.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please to don your helmets.

FROM THE TABLE THEY TAKE CLASSIC WAGNERIAN HELMETS (WITH
HORNS) AND PLACE THEM ON THEIR HEADS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please to light your candles.

THEY EACH TAKE A HUGE WHITE CANDLE FROM THE TABLE AND LIGHT
IT.  LIEBKIND FLICKS THE LIGHT SWITCH.  NOW THEY ARE IN THE
DARK EXCEPT FOR THE GLOW OF THEIR CANDLES.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please repeat after me.  I solemnly
            swear...

            Hindenburg...

            The Graf Spee...

            The Graf Spee...

                         LIEBKIND
            The Blue Max...

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
            The Blue Max...

                         LIEBKIND
            And last, but not least, Adolph...
            you know who.

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
            And last, but not least, Adolph...
            you know who.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (saluting)
            Heil you know who!

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
                   (spiritlessly saluting)
            Heil you know who!

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the
            contract.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Good.  Good.
                   (he hands Liebkind
                   the pen)


                         LIEBKIND
            No.  No.  Not in ink.  We'll
            desecrate the oath.  It must be
            done in blood.

CUT TO BLOOM'S FACE.  IT IS A SILENT OI.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fingers, please.

                                                           43.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM EXTEND THEIR FOREFINGERS AND LOOK THE
OTHER WAY.  LIEBKIND PRICKS THEM WITH THE SACRED SAFETY PIN,
AND SQUEEZES A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD FROM EACH INTO THE SACRED
VESSEL (A JAR COVER).  HE DOES THE SAME WITH HIS OWN FINGER.

                         LIEBKIND
            Ve vill sign vit this sacred qvill
            taken from the last chicken I
            served at Berchtesgarten.

LIEBKIND SIGNS.  "THE RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES" REACHES ITS
ZENITH.  IT ECHOES THROUGH THE ROOM AS WE FADE OUT.

FADE IN ON BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY WALK UP STREET AWAY
FROM TENEMENT.  IT IS LATE AFTERNOON.  THEY ARE BOTH WEARING
SWASTIKA ARM BANDS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (triumphantly whacking
                   the contract with the
                   back of his hand)
            There it is... in red and white!
            "Springtime For Hitler," signed,
            sealed and delivered.
                   (he notices Bloom's
                   dour expression)
            What's the matter with you?

                         BLOOM
            Look, I'm just not wearing this arm
            band.  I don't care how big the
            deal is.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (placating him)
            Okay, take it off, take it off.

THEY TAKE OFF THEIR ARM BANDS AND TOSS THEM INTO A LITTER
BASKET.  BIALYSTOCK SPOTS A PASSING TAXI.  HE WHISTLES.  IT
STOPS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to cab driver as he
                   opens door)
            The Blue Gypsy.

                         BLOOM
                   (about to enter cab
                   with Bialystock)
            Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?!

                                                           44.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (stopping Bloom from
                   entering cab)
            We are not going to The Blue Gypsy.
            I am going to The Blue Gypsy.

BIALYSTOCK GETS INTO CAB AND SLAMS THE DOOR.  HE CONTINUES
SPEAKING TO BLOOM THROUGH THE WINDOW.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I have a rendez-vous with a lady of
            some means.  You see dear Bloom,
            phase one is complete, the play is
            ours.  We are now entering phase
            two -- the raising of the money.
            In the days to come, you will see
            very little of me, for Bialystock
            is launching himself into little-
            old-lady-land.
                   (to cab driver)
            Avanti!

THE CAB SPEEDS AWAY.

SWISH PAN CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LITTLE OLD LADY #3.  IN HER
HAND SHE HOLDS A BUBBLING GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.  SHE RAISES IT
TO BIALYSTOCK.

PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY.
THEY ARE SEATED IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A LITTLE VIENNESE CAFE.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            Here's to the success of your new
            play.

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS GLASS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Our play, my love.

HE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST.
IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF
THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY.  THE TOAST IS A
FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS
VEST AND TROUSERS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Think nothing of it, my dear.  A
            mere trifle.  A mere trifle.  Did
            you bring your checkbook?

                                                           45.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            It's right here in my purse and I
            made it out just as you told me --
            to cash.  That's a funny name for a
            play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Think nothing of it.

SHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK
AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK.  AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE
ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE
CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED
BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE
PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED.
BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT
EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE
OLD LADY CLUTCH HER HEART.  BIALYSTOCK IS VERY UNHAPPY.  HE
QUIETLY BRINGS HIS FOOT FROM BENEATH THE TABLE AND PLACES IT
DIRECTLY OVER THE FOOT OF THE VIOLINIST.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S
FOOT.  BIALYSTOCK PROCEEDS TO CRUSH VIOLINIST'S FOOT.

CUT TO VIOLINIST'S FACE.  SOMEHOW IT CONVEYS TO US ALL THE
MISERY AND PAIN OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.  WITH EYES CROSSED
BY GRIEF, HE LIMPS TO ANOTHER TABLE.  BIALYSTOCK QUICKLY
REACHES OUT AND SNATCHES THE CHECK.

SWISH PAN CUT TO HANSOM CAB THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH
CENTRAL PARK.  NIGHT.

CUT TO INTERIOR OF CAB.  BIALYSTOCK IS COZILY ENSCONCED WITH
LITTLE OLD LADY #4.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (taking check from
                   old lady)
            Thank you, my dear.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #4
            Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again.
            Tell me again.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Edna, I swear on my life, you don't
            look a day over sixty-five.

SWISH PAN CUT TO CITY TRAFFIC.  DAY.  A TAXI FILLS THE
SCREEN.  AS IT MOVES OUT OF FRAME, WE DISCOVER BIALYSTOCK
AND LITTLE OLD LADY #5 ASTRIDE A RED AND WHITE HONDA MOTOR
SCOOTER.  AS THEY ROAR PAST THE CAMERA, BIALYSTOCK SHOUTS.

                                                           46.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Clear the road!  Clear the road!

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #5
                   (clutching Bialystock fiercely)
            Go, Bialy, baby, go!

SWISH PAN CUT TO POSH PARK AVENUE APARTMENT.  NIGHT.  A
PRIVATE CONCERN IS IN PROGRESS.  A THIN, CONSUMPTIVE-LOOKING
YOUNG MAN FINGERS HIS WAY THROUGH A CHOPIN NOCTURNE.

CAMERA SLOWLY PANS THE ROOM.  SEATED IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AROUND
THE PIANO ON VARIOUS PIECES OF DELICATE EMPIRE FURNITURE IS
AN AUSTERE GROUP OF ELDERLY DIGNIFIED PATRONS OF THE ARTS.
SUDDENLY AN OLD LADY'S SHRIEK RENDS THE AIR.  EVERYONE'S
HEAD TURNS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #6
                   (slightly flustered)
            Go on with the concert!  Go on with
            the concert!  It's nothing.  Nothing.

BIALYSTOCK STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #6
                   (to Bialystock, smiling)
            You dirty man.

SWISH PAN CUT TO NEW YORK STREET.  OLD FASHIONED LIMOUSINE
PULLS INTO VIEW.  THE WINDOW SHADES ARE DRAWN.  AS IT
PASSES, WE DETECT STRANGE SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE INTERIOR.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #7
                   (off camera)
            Tee hee, ha ha ha, ho ho, ooo, ooo,
            teehee hee.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (off camera, simultaneously)
            Heh, heh, heh.  Hah, hah, hah.

THE CAR DRIVES OUT OF FRAME.

SWISH PAN CUT TO SCULPTOR'S ATELIER.  DAY.  AN ANCIENT
LITTLE OLD LADY WEARING A SCULPTOR'S SMOCK IS FEEBLY CHIPPING
AWAY WITH CHISEL AND HAMMER AT A HUGE SQUARE BLOCK OF MARBLE.
SHE MAKES NOT A SCRATCH ON IT.

CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, HER SUBJECT,
STANDING NUDE, EXCEPT FOR LOIN CLOTH, HOLDING UP AN ENORMOUS
GLOBE.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY ATLAS.

                                                           47.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY #8
                   (stepping back to
                   admire her work)
            Well, Bialy, how's it coming?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's beautiful, Alma, beautiful.
                   (to the heavens)
            Oi.

SWISH PAN CUT TO LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.  BIALYSTOCK, DRESSED
AS A TURKISH SLAVE, IS ASLEEP ON THE SOFA.  THE ROOM HAS
BEEN DONE IN A BYZANTINE DECOR.  THE STRAINS OF SCHEHERAZADE
SOFTLY FILL THE ROOM.  SUDDENLY A WHIP COMES FLASHING INTO
THE FRAME AND WHACKS AGAINST THE TORSO OF THE SLEEPING
BIALYSTOCK.

SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL 'HOLD ME, TOUCH ME' WIELDING THE WHIP.
SHE IS DRESSED IN AN 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' COSTUME.

                         HOLD ME, TOUCH ME
            Dance!  Dance, slave!

BIALYSTOCK IS UP IN A FLASH AND INTO A QUICK TURKISH TIME
STEP SO AS TO AVOID THE DEADLY LASH.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How's this?

                         HOLD ME, TOUCH ME
            Faster, faster, you dog.  Excite
            me, delight me.  Hold me, touch me.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FACE AS HE DANCES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (murmuring to himself)
            Money is honey, money is honey.

DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.  NIGHT.  BIALYSTOCK IS
SEATED AT THE DESK.  ON ONE SIDE OF HIM IS A LARGE STACK OF
SIGNED INVESTOR CONTRACTS.  ON THE OTHER AN EQUALLY LARGE
PILE OF UNSIGNED ONES.  BIALYSTOCK SIGNS FURIOUSLY, AS BLOOM
FEEDS THE CONTRACTS TO HIM.

                         BLOOM
                   (handing Bialystock contract)
            Mrs. Sarah Catheart.  She owns 50%
            of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK DUTIFULLY SIGNS.  BLOOM TAKES ANOTHER AND PLACES
IT BEFORE BIALYSTOCK.

                                                           48.


                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also
            owns 50% of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  BLOOM PUTS THE NEXT ONE DOWN.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also
            owns 50% of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  BLOOM TAKES ANOTHER.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100%
            of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  THEN LOOKS UP AT BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Leo, what if this play is a hit?

                         BLOOM
            Then the Department of Justice owns
            100% of Bialystock and Bloom.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (Bloom's thought
                   makes him unhappy)
            OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a
            favor.  Open the safe.  I want to
            see the money.

LEO, HUMORING HIM, SPINS THE COMBINATION DIAL ON SAFE AND
OPENS IT.

CUT TO INSIDE OF SAFE.  IT IS JAMMED FULL OF NEATLY STACKED
PILES OF MONEY.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES IN FRONT OF SAFE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself.  Inhales deeply)
            That's better.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES OUT A STACK OF NEATLY FOLDED BILLS.  HE
SMELLS IT, KISSES IT AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET.

                         BLOOM
            What are you doing?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked
            very, very hard and I think I
            deserve a toy.

                                                           49.


                         BLOOM
                   (quizzically)
            A toy?

DISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP, FACE OF A GORGEOUS BLONDE, ULLA.
DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF HER.  SHE IS INCREDIBLY
WELL-ENDOWED.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEIR EYES GLUED TO HER FORM.

                         BLOOM
            That's a toy?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  She's an adult, educational
            toy made in Sweden for children
            over fifty.

BLOOM STARES AT HIM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Stop looking at me like that.
            She's not an indulgence.  She
            happens to be our new receptionist.
            She goes with our new surroundings.

QUICKLY PAN POSH NEW WALL-PAPER, FURNISHINGS, ETC.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Ulla, I'd like you to meet my
            partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.

                         ULLA
            Got dag pa dig.

                         BLOOM
            How do you do.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Have you gone mad?  A receptionist
            that can't speak English.  What
            will people say?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah,
            ooh, ooh."

                         BLOOM
            What is she gonna do here?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.

                         ULLA
            Ya, sur.

                                                           50.


ULLA GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND PLACES NEEDLE ON RECORD.  THE
DRIVING SOUND OF A TWIST FILLS THE ROOM.  ULLA SENSUOUSLY
TWISTS, VIBRATES, FRUGS, WATUSIS AND ROCKS HER BODY IN TIME
WITH MUSIC.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            See, it helps the day go by.  Ulla,
            okay.  Okay.

ULLA STOPS, GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND TAKES NEEDLE OFF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Go to desk.  Answer telephone.

HE PICKS UP PHONE TO SHOW HER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bialystock and Bloom.  Bialystock
            and Bloom.

                         ULLA
                   (repeating to herself
                   as she leaves)
            Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock
            and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.
            Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom, opening up
                   a box on his desk)
            Hey, Blum, have a cigar.

                         BLOOM
            No thanks.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES AN ENORMOUS BLACK CIGAR.

                         BLOOM
            Max, maybe...

BIALYSTOCK REACHES UNDER HIS DESK.  PRESSES BUZZER.  WE HEAR
BUZZING SOUND IN ANTE-ROOM.

                         BLOOM
            What's that?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nothing.  Nothing.  Go on.

ULLA ENTERS.  GOES TO DESK, PICKS UP CIGARETTE LIGHTER,
LIGHTS BIALYSTOCK'S CIGAR, KISSES HIM.

                                                           51.


                         ULLA
                   (pinching Bialystock's
                   cheek)
            Min Bialystock.

ULLA LEAVES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nice girl.

                         BLOOM
            Max, as I was saying, maybe we
            should go easy on the spending.  I
            mean these offices and everything.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why?  Take it when you can get it!
            Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!

                         BLOOM
            But if something should... God
            forbid... go wrong, at least we
            could give them some of their money
            back.  It would look better in court.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Stop talking like that, you white
            mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong.
            As a matter of fact, today I have
            taken steps to insure total disaster.
            At two o'clock we have an
            appointment with none other than
            Roger De Bris.

                         BLOOM
                   (searching)
            Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh
            yes, the director.  Is he good... I
            mean bad?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Roger De Bris is the worst director
            that ever lived.

                         BLOOM
            Do you think he'll take the job?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Only if we ask him.

BIALYSTOCK CONSULTS HIS WATCH.

                                                           52.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're
            late.

BIALYSTOCK BUZZES.  ULLA ENTERS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Call chauffeur.  Get car.

                         ULLA
                   (smiling)
            Good.  Good.  We go Motel.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No.  We go.
                   (he indicates Bloom
                   and himself)


                         ULLA
            You, Blum go Motel.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.

                         ULLA
                   (as she leaves)
            Get car.  Get car.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Very nice girl.

DISSOLVE TO STREET IN FRONT OF CHIC TOWNHOUSE UPPER SIXTIES.
DAY.  A WHITE ROLLS ROYCE LIMO PULLS UP.  A LIVERIED
CHAUFFEUR WITH SMALL LATIN-TYPE MUSTACHE GETS OUT AND OPENS
DOOR FOR PASSENGERS.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM GET OUT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to chauffeur)
            Thank you, Rudolfo.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CLIMB THE STEPS TO THE FRONT DOOR.
BIALYSTOCK PUSHES THE DOORBELL.  WE HEAR CHIMES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whispering)
            Now don't let anything he does or
            says upset you.  He's a little
            peculiar.

                         BLOOM
            What do you mean?

                                                           53.


THE DOOR OPENS.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS A THIN, STRANGE
LOOKING MAN IN A BLACK TURTLENECK SWEATER.  (CARMEN GIYA)
HE CONTEMPLATES THEM COLDLY.

                         CARMEN
            Yesssssss?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I am Max Bialystock.  This is my
            associate, Mr. Bloom.  We have an
            appointment with Mr. De Bris.

                         CARMEN
            Ah, yes, you're expected.  Please
            come in.

THEY ENTER THE VESTIBULE.  CARMEN CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND THEM.

                         CARMEN
            How do you do.  I'm Carmen Giya, Mr.
            De Bris' private secretary.  Would
            you be so kind as to remove your
            shoes.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER BEWILDERED.

                         CARMEN
            White, white, white is the color of
            our carpets.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM REMOVE THEIR SHOES.

                         CARMEN
                   (to Bloom indicating
                   a rack of slippers)
            Now, let's see, you're wearing grey.
            I would suggest the crimson.
            They're a little vivid, but your
            suit is so quiet.
                   (to Bialystock,
                   studying his mish
                   mash attire)
            Why don't you... Oh, take anything.
            Please follow me.

CARMEN LEADS THE WAY.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCUFF AFTER HIM.
WE FOLLOW THEM DOWN A NARROW CORRIDOR LINED WITH EXAMPLES OF
CLASSIC GREEK SCULPTURE -- EACH ONE DEPICTING NUDE MALES IN
VARIOUS POSES.

INT: ELEVATOR.

CUT TO ROGER DE BRIS' BOUDOIR SITTING ROOM.  IT IS ELEGANTLY
FEMININE.

                                                           54.


CHAISE LOUNGE, ANTIQUE MIRRORS, LOUIS XVI ARMOIRE AND
DRESSING TABLE.  FROM BEHIND AN ORNATE DRESSING SCREEN, WE
HEAR MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISCONTENT.

                         DE BRIS
                   (from behind screen)
            I'll never get into this damned
            thing.

CUT TO BOUDOIR ENTRANCE.  CARMEN, BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER.

                         CARMEN
                   (to De Bris)
            We're not alone.

DE BRIS' HEAD POPS OVER THE SCREEN.  HE IS A ONCE HANDSOME,
NOW DISSIPATED MAN IN HIS LATE FORTIES.

                         DE BRIS
            Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I
            presume.  Ha, ha, ha, forgive the
            pun.

                         BLOOM
                   (to Bialystock)
            What pun?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (a curt whisper)
            Shut up.  He thinks he's witty.
                   (to De Bris)
            It's good to see you again, Roger.
            Did you get a chance to read
            "Springtime For Hitler?"

DE BRIS EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN.  HE IS WEARING A
"LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN" STYLE DRESS.

                         DE BRIS
            Remarkable.  Remarkable.  A stunning
            piece of work.

                         BLOOM
                   (shocked, whispers)
            Max!  He's wearing a dress.
                   (his mouth remains open)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shhhhhh.

                                                           55.


                         DE BRIS
                   (continuing)
            I think it's a very important play.
            I, for one, never realized that the
            Third Reich meant Germany.  I mean
            it's drenched with historical
            goodies like that.

DE BRIS IS SUDDENLY AWARE OF BLOOM'S EXPRESSION.  (BLOOM'S
MOUTH IS STILL AGAPE.)

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, dear, you're staring at my
            dress.  I should explain.  I'm
            going to the Choreographer's Ball
            tonight.  There's a prize for the
            best costume.

                         CARMEN
                   (smugly)
            We always win.

                         DE BRIS
                   (looking in the mirror)
            I'm not so sure about tonight.  I'm
            supposed to be the Grand Duchess --
            I think I look more like Tugboat
            Annie.  What do you think?

HE PARADES BACK AND FORTH, EXECUTING SHARP TURNS LIKE A
MODEL AT A FASHION SHOW.

                         DE BRIS
            No be cruel.  Be brutal.  Be brutal.
            Because heaven knows they will.
            Well, what do you think, Mr. Bloom?

                         BLOOM
                   (very embarrassed)
            Well, it's... uh... it's nice and
            long... I mean, it's... uh... uh...
            where do you keep your wallet?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (jumping in)
            It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous.
            You couldn't have picked a better
            color.  It brings out your eyes.
            Let's face it, Roger, that dress is
            you.

                                                           56.


                         DE BRIS
                   (his eyes flashing flirtatiously)
            Do you really think it brings out
            my eyes?

                         CARMEN
                   (irritated)
            We can't tell a thing without your
            wig.  As far as I'm concerned,
            you're only half-dressed.

                         DE BRIS
            Ummmm.  Well, if you're so worried
            about the wig, get it, o' wicked
            witch of the west.

CARMEN TURNS IN A HUFF AND LEAVES TO GET THE WIG.  DE BRIS
REACHES INTO CUT CRYSTAL CIGARETTE BOX, TAKES CIGARETTE,
TAPS IT, AND HOLDS IT FOR A LIGHT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a whisper to Bloom)
            Quick, light his cigarette.  He
            likes you.

BLOOM NERVOUSLY REACHES FOR A BOOK OF MATCHES, RIPS ONE OUT
AND STRIKES IT.  IT DOESN'T LIGHT.  HE TRIES ANOTHER AND
ANOTHER.  ONE FINALLY CATCHES FIRE.  HE TRIES TO HOLD IT
STEADY, BUT HE IS TOO NERVOUS.  DE BRIS FIRMLY PLACES HIS
HAND OVER BLOOM'S TO STEADY THE FLAME.

                         DE BRIS
            Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?

HE LIGHTS THE CIGARETTE BUT CONTINUES TO HOLD BLOOM'S HAND.

                         BLOOM
            I've... I've... never been on a
            cruise.

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, quel dommage.

CARMEN ENTERS CARRYING WIG.  HE SEES DE BRIS HOLDING BLOOM'S
HAND.

                         CARMEN
                   (snidely)
            Oh, I see we're getting acquainted.

DE BRIS DROPS BLOOM'S HAND AND TURNS ON CARMEN.

                                                           57.


                         DE BRIS
            How would you like to go back to
            teasing hair, big mouth?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Roger, do you mind if we talk a
            little business?

                         DE BRIS
            Please, please, that's what we're
            here for.
                   (to Carmen, who is
                   adjusting the wig)
            Be careful, that hurt.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I think this would be a marvelous
            opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to
            now, you've always been associated
            with musicals, and...

                         DE BRIS
            Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey
            gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-
            turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to
            make you throw up!  At last a
            chance to do straight drama!  To
            deal with conflict, with inner
            truth.  Roger De Bris presents
            history.  Of course, I think we
            should add a little music.  That
            whole third act has got to go.
            They're losing the war.  It's too
            depressing.  We'll have to put
            something in there.
                   (gripped by his vision)
            Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of
            beautiful girls, dressed as Storm
            Troopers, black patent leather
            boots, all marching together...
            Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn-
            kick-turn!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            That's genius.  That's genius.
            Roger, I think I speak for Mr.
            Bloom and myself when I say that
            you're the only man in the world
            who can do justice to SPRINGTIME
            FOR HITLER.

                                                           58.


                         DE BRIS
                   (in one rush)
            Wait a minute.  This is a very big
            decision.  It might effect the
            course of my entire life.  I'll
            have to think about it.  I'll do it.

DE BRIS EXTENDS HIS HAND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES IT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations.

                         DE BRIS
                   (to Carmen)
            Get on the phone.  Send out a
            casting call.  Call every agent in
            town.  I want to see everybody.
            Everybody.

DISSOLVE TO STAGE DOOR OF BROADWAY THEATRE.  DAY.  SIGN ON
DOOR READS:  CASTING TODAY -- SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR OF THEATRE.  THE PLACE IS A
MADHOUSE.  HUNDREDS OF WOULD-BE HITLERS FILL THE STAGE.
EACH AND EVERY ONE WITH THE FUHRER'S HAIRCUT AND LITTLE
SQUARE MUSTACHE.  THERE ARE TALL HITLERS, SHORT HITLERS, FAT
HITLERS, SKINNY HITLERS, METHOD HITLERS, SHAKESPEAREAN
HITLERS, ALL KINDS HITLERS.

CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE.  SEATED THERE, WATCHING THE
BEDLAM, ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, DE BRIS, CARMEN GIYA AND
FRANZ LIEBKIND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (looking for the
                   least likely Hitler)
            Roger, what about that one?  The
            fat Hitler on the right?

                         DE BRIS
            I don't know.  I rather fancy that
            one.

CUT TO BEAUTIFUL, BLOND, MUSCULAR, YOUNG MAN, WHO LOOKS AS
IF HE IS POSING FOR "BODY BEAUTIFUL." HE BEARS NOT THE
SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO HITLER EVEN THOUGH HE DOES SPORT A
LITTLE BLACK MUSTACHE.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Not bad.  Not bad.  What do you
            think, Franz?

                                                           59.


                         LIEBKIND
                   (very emotional)
            I don't know.  I don't know.  For
            some strange reason, I'm deeply
            moved.
                   (he wipes away a tear)


                         DE BRIS
                   (getting to his feet)
            Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam.  We
            must have some order.

DE BRIS, FOLLOWED BY CARMEN, HOPS TO THE STAGE AND ADDRESSES
THE MILLING MOB.

                   (clapping his hands
                   for attention)
            Will all the dancing Hitlers please
            wait in the wings.  We're only
            taking the singing Hitlers.

AS THE DANCING HITLERS LEAVE THE STAGE, CARMEN ARRANGES THE
SINGING HITLERS SO THAT THEY ARE IN A LONG STRAIGHT LINE
AGAINST THE BACK OF THE STAGE WALL.  CARMEN READS OUT A NAME
AND THE FIRST SINGING HITLER WALKS DOWNSTAGE TO AUDITION.
EXCEPT FOR A SPORTY LITTLE HITLER MUSTACHE, HE BEARS LITTLE
RESEMBLANCE TO THE FUHRER.

                         DE BRIS
            Hello, Arthur.  Tell us something
            about yourself.

                         ARTHUR PACKARD
                   (in a strangulated
                   tenor's voice)
            I was the lead tenor of the
            Albuquerque Opera Company for two
            seasons.  I just finished a road
            tour of STUDENT PRINCE.  And last
            season I was up for the lead in the
            Broadway production of Circus Man.

                         DE BRIS
            What happened?

                         ARTHUR PACKARD
            I didn't get it.

                                                           60.


                         DE BRIS
            What are you going to sing for us
            Arthur?

AS ARTHUR TELLS HIM THE TITLE OF HIS SONG, DE BRIS MOUTHS IT
WORD FOR WORD TOWARD HIS FRIEND, CARMEN.

            Thank you.

            Jason Green.

JASON GREEN COMES DOWNSTAGE.  HE IS A BIG, BARREL-CHESTED
MAN.  HE ALSO WEARS HITLER-TYPE MUSTACHE.

                         DE BRIS
            Well, Jason, what have you been
            doing lately?

                         JASON GREEN
                   (in basso profundo)
            For the last sixteen years, I've
            been touring with "Naughty Marietta."

                         DE BRIS
            Good.  And what are you going to
            sing for us, Jason?

AS JASON TELLS HIM THE SONG'S TITLE, DE BRIS ONCE AGAIN
MOUTHS IT WORD FOR WORD WITH HIM.

                         JASON GREEN
            "Stout-hearted Men."

BEGINNING OF "STOUT-HEARTED MEN" MONTAGE.

            "Give me some men
            Who are stout-hearted men
            Who will fight for the right they
            adore."

                         DE BRIS

            Thaaank you.

            Who are stout-hearted men
            And I'll soon show you ten thousand
            more."

                         DE BRIS
                   (off-camera voice)
            Thaaank you.

DISSOLVE TO ANOTHER HITLER (ITALIAN BASSO)

                         ITALIAN HITLER
                   (singing)
            "Shoulder to shoulder and bolder
            and bolder
            They grow as they march to the war."

                         DE BRIS
                   (voice off camera)
            Thaaank you.

DISSOLVE TO DELICATE HITLER

                         DELICATE HITLER
                   (singing)
            "There is nothing in this world can
            halt or mar our plan."

                         DE BRIS

                   (voice off camera)
            Thaaank you.

CUT TO CARMEN GIYA ON STAGE.  IT IS NOW EMPTY.

                         CARMEN
            Well, that's it.

CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE.  SLOW PAN BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM,
DE BRIS, AD LIEBKIND.  THEY ARE TIRED, DISHEVELED AND UNHAPPY.

                         BLOOM
            I think that's enough Hitlers for
            one day.  Maybe we'll get lucky
            tomorrow.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You think out of all those Hitlers
            you could find just one...

                         LIEBKIND
            It was the same thing in Germany.
            We looked for years before we found
            the right Hitler.

FROM OFF-STAGE WE HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF BOOTS APPROACHING.
ALL EYES TURN TOWARD THE STAGE.  FROM OUT OF THE WINGS STEPS

A YOUNG PERSON IN A LEATHER DOUBLET, HIGH LEATHER BOOTS, AND
EXTREMELY LONG HAIR.  IT CARRIES A GUITAR.  UNTIL IT SPEAKS,
WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG WOMAN.

                         LSD
            Hey, man.

                         CARMEN
            I beg your pardon.

                         LSD
            Is this where they're auditioning
            Boomerang?

                         CARMEN
                   (studying him coldly)
            No, I'm afraid you've wandered into
            the wrong theatre.

                         LSD
                   (to himself, as he
                   starts to leave)
            Man, freaked out again.

                                                           63.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (leaping to his feet)
            Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is
            Boomerang.

                         DE BRIS
                   (to Bialystock)
            What are you saying?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Let's hear him.  What have we got
            to lose?
                   (to LSD)
            What's your name?

                         LSD
            Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody
            calls me LSD.

                         DE BRIS
            What have you done, LSD?

                         LSD
            Six months, I'm out on probation,
            but it's cool now, baby.

                         DE BRIS
            I mean in show business.

                         LSD
            Oh, in show business.  Well, let's
            put it this way, my next job will
            be my debut.

                         DE BRIS
            What do you do best?

                         LSD
            Hey, man, I can't do that here,
            that's what they put me away for.

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, sing.  Sing!

                         LSD
            Hey, baby, that's where they put
            me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know
            that, you been up?

                         DE BRIS
                   (a little hysterical)
            Sing a song!  Just sing a song!

                                                           64.


                         LSD
            Here's a little thing I think
            you're going to see on the charts
            any day.  I wrote it last night in
            my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk
            Rock Ballad.

LSD SINGS "I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT." THE
SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT "RAGA ROCK" BEAT.  PHRASES
SUCH AS, "CONNECT WITH THE INFINITE" AND "TURN ON THE
WORLD." LORENZO FINISHES THE NUMBER.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM, LIEBKIND AND DE BRIS.  THEY ARE
STUNNED.  BIALYSTOCK IS THE FIRST TO RECOVER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting)
            That's our Hitler!

                         LIEBKIND
                   (howls of despair)
            Vaaaat???

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (quickly)
            Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a
            man of his time.  This is a man of
            his time.

                         LIEBKIND
            But he has long hair!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Don't look at the outside, look at
            the inside.  It's the inner Hitler
            we're after.  The young beautiful
            Hitler, who danced his way to glory.

                         LIEBKIND
            I don't know.  I don't know.

                         DE BRIS
                   (he has been studying
                   LSD intensely)
            Could be an exciting piece of off-
            beat casting.  Of course, we'd have
            to do something about that coiffure.

                         LIEBKIND
            But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy,
            he's so... so... American!

                                                           65.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't
            let you down.

                         LIEBKIND
            All right, but remember, if you
            damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I
            kill you.

DISSOLVE TO MARQUEE OF BROADWAY THEATRE.  MARQUEE READS:
OPENING TONIGHT - SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.  Directed by ROGER
DE BRIS.

PAN DOWN TO THEATRE ENTRANCE.  THE SIDEWALK IS CHOKED WITH
OPENING NIGHTERS, ALL AGLITTER IN DIAMONDS, FURS AND ELEGANT
TUXEDOS.  LUXURIOUS BLACK LIMOUSINES PULL UP TO THE CURB,
DEPOSITING THEIR RICH CONTENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE
LITTLE OLD LADIES.

CUT TO LOBBY.  THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SWIRLING CONFUSION
STAND BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IN THEIR OPENING NIGHT TAILS.
BIALYSTOCK IS RESPLENDENT IN A BLACK SILK CAPE, LINED IN
CRIMSON SATIN.  BLOOM'S TAILS ARE OBVIOUSLY RENTED.  THEY
ARE NEAR THE TICKET TAKER.  AS SOME OF THE OPENING NIGHT
"SUPPORTERS" ENTER THE THEATRE, THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENTS TO
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  TO EACH OF THE WELL-WISHERS,
BIALYSTOCK RESPONDS WITH A SMILE AND A MUMBLE.  THEY GET THE
SMILE, WE HEAR THE MUMBLE.

                         FIRST WELL-WISHER
                   (a silver-haired
                   gentleman in his late fifties)
            Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big
            hit.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (mumbling)
            Bite your tongue.

                         SECOND WELL-WISHER
                   (a little old lady)
            We're gonna do it this time, Bialy,
            I just know it.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I hope you lose your bloomers.

                         THIRD WELL-WISHER
                   (another old lady)
            My prayers go with you, Bialy.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            God Forbid.

                                                           66.


CUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE.  DOORMAN
OPENS DOOR, ASSISTS RICH COUPLE OUT OF CAR.  LIMOUSINE PULLS
AWAY.  A MOTORCYCLE WITH SIDE-CAR ROARS UP TO FRONT OF
THEATRE.  AT THE HANDLEBARS, BEAUTIFULLY DECKED OUT IN
TUXEDO AND HIS EVER POPULAR GERMAN HELMET IS FRANZ LIEBKIND.

CAMERA FOLLOWS LIEBKIND AS HE ENTERS LOBBY.  HE MAKES HIS
WAY THROUGH THE MILLING THRONG TOWARD BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bialystock and
                   Bloom, very seriously)
            Gentlemen, this is a very momentous
            moment.

HE CLICKS HIS HEELS AND SHAKES HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bloom)
            Good luck.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Good luck.

HE STARTS INTO THEATRE, STOPS, TURNS BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND
BLOOM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (a mad gleam in his eye)
            Tonight, New York.  Tomorrow, the
            world!

HE TURNS TRIUMPHANTLY AND ENTERS THE THEATRE.

                         OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)
            Check your hat?

                         LIEBKIND
                   (off camera)
            No!!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So much for Nutsy Fagin.

                         BLOOM
                   (nudging Bialystock, whispers)
            Here comes the Times Drama Critic.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Watch closely, as Bialystock drives
            the last nail into the coffin.

BIALYSTOCK AMBLES OVER TO THE TIMES CRITIC, WHO HAS STOPPED
TO CHAT WITH SOME PEOPLE.

                                                           67.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Always delighted to see the
            gentlemen of the press.  There you
            are, sir.  Two on the aisle,
            compliments of the management.
                   (he smiles unctuously)


                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (haughtily accepting tickets)
            Thank you.  Here, wait a minute.
            There seems to be some mistake.
            There's a hundred dollar bill
            wrapped around these tickets.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (conspiratorially)
            It's no mistake.  Enjoy the show.

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (outraged)
            Mr. Bialystock, just what do you
            think you're doing?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'm bribing you.  And if you play
            ball, there's a lot more where that
            came from.

BIALYSTOCK WINKS AND SAUNTERS OFF.

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (blustering with rage)
            I... I... I... How dare he!  I've
            never been so insulted in my life!
            The gall of the man!  The incredible
            gall of the man!  I'll fix his wagon.

THE CRITIC STALKS INTO THE THEATRE.  AS HE PASSES BIALYSTOCK,
HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY FLINGS THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL TO THE
FLOOR.  HE DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR.

                         OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)
            Check your hat?

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (off camera)
            No!!

BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN, PICKS UP CRUMPLED DOLLAR BILL,
STRAIGHTENS IT OUT, PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET.

                                                           68.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (grinning like a
                   Cheshire cat)
            Heh, heh, heh.  He'll kill us.

FROM INSIDE THE THEATRE, WE HEAR THE OVERTURE BEGINNING.
LIGHTS IN THE LOBBY BLINK.

                         BLOOM
            Come on, they've started the
            overture.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE THEATRE.

CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING DARKENED
THEATRE.  THEY TAKE POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.
BLOOM EXTENDS HIS HAND TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE INTENDS TO SPEAK
IN A CONFIDENT AND CONTROLLED MANNER BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS
AN HYSTERICAL SHRIEK.

                         BLOOM
                   (casually shrieking)
            Well, Max, this is it!!!

HE SCARES HIMSELF AND QUICKLY CLAPS HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH.

                         BLOOM
                   (whispers)
            I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Relax, in two hours our worries
            will be over.

CUT TO STAGE.  AS THE OVERTURE IS CONCLUDED, THE CURTAIN
SLOWLY RISES.  ON STAGE THERE IS A LINE OF GIRLS DRESSED IN
SEXY STORM TROOPER COSTUMES--BLACK PATENT LEATHER BOOTS, ETC.
THEIR ARMS ARE LINKED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY DANCE AND
KICK IN RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL ROCKETTE FASHION.

                         STORM TROOPER CHORUS
                   (singing)
            Germany was having trouble,
            What a sad, sad story.
            Needed a new leader
            To restore its former glory.
            Where, oh, where was he,
            Who could that man be,
            We looked around,
            And then we found,
            The man for you and me,
            And now its...

                                                           69.


THE STORM TROOPER ROCKETTES PART AND FROM ABOVE THEM,
DESCENDING TWIN STAIRCASES, WE SEE TWO LINES OF BEAUTIFUL
SHOWGIRLS, HOLDING HUGE BALLOONS ABOVE THEIR HEADS.  ON EACH
BALLOON IS PAINTED A PICTURE OF THE FUHRER.  EVERYONE SINGS
AS THEY DESCEND.

                         ENTIRE CHORUS
                   (singing)
            "Springtime for Hitler," etc.

CUT TO AUDIENCE.  NUMBER ON STAGE CONTINUES.

CLOSE-UP OF MAN AND WOMAN ON AISLE.

                         WOMAN (DOWAGER)
            This is shocking!

CUT TO ANOTHER AREA OF AUDIENCE.  ANOTHER COUPLE.

                         MAN (STUFFED SHIRT)
            Outrageous!

CUT TO CRITIC ON THE AISLE, BIALYSTOCK'S P.O.V.  HE SCOWLS
AS HE FURIOUSLY MAKES NOTES.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AT BACK OF THEATRE.  THEY ARE
SMILING.  BIALYSTOCK POINTS TO COUPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR
SEATS AND STARTED UP THE AISLE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Ahhhhh, it's going better than I
            expected.

THE COUPLE COMES ABREAST OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         WOMAN
                   (to man as they exit theatre)
            Well, talk about bad taste.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (he chuckles as they leave)
            Come, let us repair to the bar
            across the street.  I don't want to
            be caught here during intermission.
            We'll be stoned to death.

THEY LINK ARMS AND MERRILY MARCH OUT OF THE THEATRE.

CUT TO STAGE.  "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER" OPENING IS ENDING IN
A GREAT CRESCENDO OF PATRIOTIC INSANITY.

                                                           70.


                         ENTIRE CHORUS
                   (singing)
            So Springtime for Hitler,
            Is Springtime for Goering,
            Is Springtime for Goebbels,
            Is Springtime for Himmler,
            Is Springtime for you and me!!

CURTAIN FALLS.  THE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE AUDIENCE WITH
HUSHED SILENCE.  FOLLOWED BY A SURGE TOWARD THE DOORS.  THE
AISLES ARE CHOKED WITH UNHAPPY PEOPLE, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET
OUT.

CURTAIN RISES.  ON STAGE ARE EVA BRAUN AND HITLER (LSD).
EVA BRAUN IS A FETCHING BLONDE IN LONG BRAIDS.  LSD IS
PACING UP AND DOWN.  EVA BRAUN SITS ON LOVE SEAT DOWNSTAGE.
IN HER HAND IS AN OVERSIZED DAISY.  AS SHE PULLS THE PETALS
FROM IT, SHE WHINES.  SHE HAS A PRONOUNCED AMERICAN ACCENT.

                         EVA
            Er liebt mir.  Er liebt mir nicht.
            Er liebt mir.
                   (the last petal)
            Er liebt mir nicht.

CUT TO PEOPLE IN AISLE.  THEY HAVE NOTICEABLY SLOWED DOWN.
SOME ARE WALKING BACKWARDS.  THEY ARE INTRIGUED.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

                         EVA
                   (turns to LSD)
            Du liebt mir nicht!

                         LSD
                   (protesting vehemently)
            I lieb you baby, I lieb you.  You
            know that.

                         EVA
            If you lieb me, why are you leaving
            me?

                         LSD
            Hey, man, I can't spend all my time
            with you.  I took an oath, baby,
            Deutschland uber alles.

CUT TO AUDIENCE IN AISLES.  THEY HAVE ALL STOPPED LEAVING TO
TURN AND WATCH.  SOME BEGIN TO LAUGH AND OTHERS APPLAUD.
THEY LIKE LSD.

                                                           71.


                         MAN
            That's Hitler?  I get it!  It's a
            put-on.

CUT TO WOMAN.

                         WOMAN
            Hey, Harry, he's funny.

NOW THERE IS A MAD RUSH TO REGAIN THEIR SEATS.

CUT TO INTERIOR BAR.  IT IS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE BARTENDER
AND A DRUNK AT THE FAR END OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ARE SEATED ON STOOLS AT THE BAR.  THEY CLINK GLASSES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here's to the one and only
            performance of "Springtime for
            Hitler."

THEY BOTH LAUGH AND DOWN THEIR DRINKS.  BIALYSTOCK RAPS ON
THE BAR WITH HIS CANE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Innkeeper, innkeeper, another round
            of drinks here.  As a matter of
            fact, a round of drinks for
            everybody in the place!

BARTENDER LOOKS AROUND AT THE ALMOST EMPTY BARROOM.  DOES A
LITTLE TAKE.  HE THEN REPLENISHES THEIR DRINKS AND PLACES A
GLASS IN FRONT OF THE DRUNK.  THE DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT
GRACIOUSLY TOWARDS BIALYSTOCK.

                         BLOOM
            Just think, yesterday I was a
            meaningless little accountant --
            and today, I am the producer of a
            Broadway flop!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (raising his glass)
            To failure!

                         BLOOM
            To failure!

                         DRUNK
                   (blushing)
            Oh, thank you!  It's very kind of
            you.
                   (raises his glass and
                   downs his drink)
                         (MORE)

                                                           72.


                         DRUNK (CONT'D)


CUT BACK TO STAGE.  SAME SCENE.  EVA STARTS TO CRY.

                         EVA
            If the Duke of Windsor could give
            up the Throne of England for the
            woman he loved, why can't you?

                         LSD
            It's different.  I'm a tyrant, baby.

AUDIENCE LAUGHS.

CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND SEATED IN AN AISLE SEAT.  HE NERVOUSLY
PINCHES HIS FACE AS HE SEMI-COHERENTLY MUMBLES TO HIMSELF.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (becoming slightly unhinged)
            Baby, why does he keep saying baby?
            I didn't write baby.  The Fuhrer
            never said baby.  Vat is it vit
            this baby?

                         WOMAN IN ADJOINING SEAT
                   (very annoyed)
            Will you shut up!

                         LIEBKIND
            You shut up!  I'm the author.
            You're just the audience.  I
            outrank you.

CUT TO BAR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE A LITTLE TIPSY.  BY
NOW THE DRUNK HAS JOINED THEM AND ALL THREE ARE GOOD PALS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bartender, bartender, another drink
            for myself and my associate, Mr.
            Bloom.  And don't forget our good-
            natured inebriate over there.

DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT GRACIOUSLY.

                         DRUNK
            Eternally grateful.  Sincerely
            yours, Oliver Wendell Drunk.

DURING DRUNK'S SPEECH, BARTENDER HAS REFILLED THEIR GLASSES.
HE STANDS BACK, WATCHING THEM AS HE DRIES GLASSES.

                                                           73.


                         DRUNK
                   (raises his glass)
            A toast!

                         BLOOM
            To what?

                         DRUNK
                   (stumped)
            To... toast!  I love toast.

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
            To toast.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (smacking his glass
                   down on the bar)
            Now I'll take the lead and I want
            you right behind me all the way!
            One... two... three!
                   (singing)
            "By the light,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
                   (singing)
            "By the light, by the light,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Of the silvery moon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "Of the silvery mooooon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "I want to croon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "He wants to croon, he wants to
            croon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "To my honey I'll croon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "He's gonna croon love's tune,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Honeymoon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "Honeymoon, honeymoon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Keep a shining in...

                                                           74.


BIALYSTOCK STOPS ABRUPTLY.  HE POINTS TOWARD THE DOOR.  WE
HEAR THE SOUND OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE BAR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Intermission!  Quick, hide your
            face.  They'll tear us to pieces.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM HOP ON THEIR STOOLS AND COVER THEIR
FACES WITH THEIR HANDS.  THE DRUNK SHRUGS, HOPS ON THE STOOL
NEXT TO THEM AND ALSO HIDES HIS FACE.  A HORDE OF FIRST
NIGHTERS SWEEPS INTO THE BAR.  THEY ARE ALL AROUND
BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND THE DRUNK, CLAMORING FOR DRINKS.

                         CROWD
                   (ad-lib)
            "Scotch on the rocks,"
            "Bourbon and soda."
            "Two martinis."
            "Whiskey sour."

THE CROWD IS VERY CHEERFUL.  THEY ARE STILL BUBBLING FROM
THE FIRST ACT.

                         WOMAN
                   (to her escort)
            Well, so far that's about the
            funniest thing I've ever seen on
            Broadway.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

                         WOMAN'S ESCORT
            Never laughed so much in my life.

                         MAN
                   (to his friend)
            Hysterical, absolutely hysterical.

                         MAN'S FRIEND
            I thought I'd split my sides.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Take it easy, don't panic.  There
            are a lot of plays on this street.
            They are not necessarily talking
            about "Springtime For Hitler."

                         HUSBAND
                   (to his wife)
            Honey, I never in a million years
            thought I'd ever love a show called
            "Springtime For Hitler."

                                                           75.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM FREEZE.  A LITTLE OLD LADY COMES UP
BEHIND BIALYSTOCK.  SHE RAPS HIM ON THE BACK WITH HER
UMBRELLA.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #8
            Bialy, you sly fox, you've done it.
            It's a smasheroo.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a daze)
            Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.

THE CROWD STARTS TO LEAVE.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't
            want to miss one minute of it.

THE FIRST NIGHTERS LEAVE THE BAR.  ALL THAT REMAIN ARE
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, THE BARTENDER AND THE DRUNK.
BIALYSTOCK SLIPS OFF THE STOOL AND WANDERS TO MIDDLE OF
BARROOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (dazed)
            Got to think... Got to think... Got
            to think... Got to think... Got to
            think...

CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD.
HIS EYES ARE GLAZED WITH SHOCK.  HE STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH
HIS LITTLE BLUE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Cathcart -- 50%
            Mrs. Biddlecombe -- 50%
            Mrs. Wentworth -- 50%
            Mrs. Resnick -- 100%

THE DRUNK STARES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.  UNHAPPY WITH THEIR
PRESENT MOOD, HE DECIDES TO LIVEN THINGS UP AGAIN.  HE
TIPTOES OVER TO BIALYSTOCK, PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND BIALYSTOCK'S
WAIST, ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND BEGINS TO SING.

                         DRUNK
                   (singing)
            "By the light...
            By the light, by the light...
            Of the silvery...

BIALYSTOCK PICKS HIM UP AND THROWS HIM ACROSS THE BAR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Get away from me, you drunken bum!

                                                           76.


DRUNK PICKS HIMSELF UP AND DUSTS HIMSELF OFF.

                         DRUNK
                   (indignantly)
            Fairweather friend!

THE DRUNK STAGGERS OUT OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK GETS A HOLD
OF HIMSELF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Maybe it's not true!

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES OVER TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (still mumbling to himself)
            No way out.  No way out.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.

BLOOM DOES NOT RESPOND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES HIM.

                         BLOOM
                   (droning monotonously)
            No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why don't we go over to the theatre
            and see what's really happening?
            After all, we've only heard from a
            small portion of the audience.
            Let's hear what the majority thinks.

                         BLOOM
                   (in a trance)
            The majority.  The majority.  Yes.
            Let's hear from the majority.

THEY START TO LEAVE.

DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING LOBBY OF THEATRE.
AS THEY OPEN DOOR TO THEATRE, THEY ARE GREETED BY A SHOCK
WAVE OF LAUGHTER.  THEY PAUSE STRICKEN.

                         BLOOM
            I don't want to go in.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come, we have to.

THEY TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS LIKE TWO FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOYS
AND CAUTIOUSLY WALK IN.

                                                           77.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY ENTER.  THEY TAKE THEIR
POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS
MEEKLY, LIKE TWO LAMBS AWAITING THE SLAUGHTER.

CUT TO STAGE.  HITLER HAS OBVIOUSLY CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR.
THE FUHRER IS SURROUNDED BY HIS GENERAL STAFF.

                         GENERAL
                   (making a report)
            We are falling back on all fronts.
            Our soldiers are retreating.

                         LSD
            No good, baby, no good.  You heard
            my orders.  Nobody retreats.
            Attack!  Attack!

                         GENERAL
            Who can we attack?  They're all too
            big.

                         LSD
                   (getting an inspiration)
            Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!

                         GENERAL
            We can't... we keep our money there!

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE STRAIGHT
AHEAD, STONY-FACED.  HUGE TEARS WELL UP IN THEIR EYES AND
RUN DOWN THEIR CHEEKS.

CUT TO LIEBKIND.  HE HAS RIPPED OFF THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR AND
IS EARNESTLY GNAWING AT IT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Baby, again with that baby.  There
            must be no more babies.

LIEBKIND LEAPS FROM HIS SEAT AND HEADS TOWARD THE SIDE
ENTRANCE LEADING TO THE STAGE.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

                         LSD
            Where's Goebbels?  Where's my
            little Joe?

                         GENERAL
                   (to the wings)
            Send for Goebbels.

                                                           78.


                         LSD
            He's the only cat left that still
            grooves me.

GOEBBELS ENTERS LAUGHING.

                         GOEBBELS
            Heil, baby!  I just finished the
            morning propaganda broadcasts.

                         LSD
            What did you tell the people?

                         GOEBBELS
            I told them we invaded England.

                         LSD
            Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we
            come out?

                         GOEBBELS
            We won.

                         LSD
            Groovy!

THEY SMACK HANDS.

LAUGH FROM AUDIENCE.

CUT TO BACKSTAGE.  LIEBKIND COMES CHARGING IN LIKE A LUNATIC.

                         LIEBKIND
            Bring down the curtain!  Bring down
            the curtain!

HE RUSHES FOR THE CURTAIN ROPE.  A STAGEHAND ATTEMPTS TO
STOP HIM.  HE RIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND BANGS HIM OVER THE
HEAD WITH IT.  AS HE SLUMPS TO THE GROUND, LIEBKIND UNDOES
THE CURTAIN ROPE.

CUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE.

                         LSD
            Goebbels, you're the only one...

THE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD.  FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS
LIEBKIND.  HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I am the author of this play.  You
            are the victims of a hoax.  These
            are not my words.  The Fuhrer never
            said baby.  The Fuhrer was sweet,
            the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was
            good.

                                                           79.


                         STAGE MANAGER
                   (off camera)
            Get that curtain up.

CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE.  LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND
HOLDS IT DOWN.

                         LIEBKIND
            NO!  No!  The curtain must not go up!

DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  LIEBKIND
DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT.  HE STARTS TO GO UP.

                         LIEBKIND
            Stop!  Stop!

AS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS
AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT.  THE AUDIENCE,
THINKING LIEBKIND'S BEHAVIOR PART OF THE SHOW, ENJOYS THE
PROCEEDINGS TREMENDOUSLY.  THEY BREAK INTO APPLAUSE.

CUT TO CRITIC.  HE IS LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AND TEARING UP
HIS NOTES.

CUT BACK TO LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
            We have been betrayed!  I will
            return!  I will returnnnnn...

LIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES.

DISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE.  DAY.
ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER.
MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND.
IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH
SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS
AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS.  SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE.
THE DOOR FLIES OPEN.  THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ENTER.  ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING
HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS.

                         ULLA
            We make love?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go
            to work.

ULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE
AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE.  BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND
FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM.

                                                           80.


HE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE.  THE OFFICE IS
FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS.  BIALYSTOCK
SWOOPS DOWN ON THE TELEGRAMS.  HE RIPS ONE OPEN AND BEGINS
READING.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Congratulations.  It's the biggest
            hit on Broadway."

HE TEARS IT UP AND THROWS IT AWAY.  HE PICKS UP ANOTHER AND
READS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Congratulations.  Hitler will run
            forever."

HE THROWS IT AWAY.  BIALYSTOCK ATTACKS THE PILE OF TELEGRAMS.
WITHOUT OPENING THEM UP, HE TEARS THEM ONE AT A TIME.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (boiling with rage)
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.  POSED IN THE DOORWAY IS ROGER DE BRIS.
IN ONE HAND HE CARRIES AN OPEN, BUBBLING MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE.

                         DE BRIS
                   (ecstatic)
            Congratulations!  Have you seen the
            reviews?  Have you seen the lines
            at the box office?  It's a torrent,
            it's an avalanche, it's the biggest
            hit on Broadway!

HE STARTS INTO THE ROOM.  BIALYSTOCK GROWLS AND LUNGES AT HIM.

                                                           81.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You lousy fruit.  You've ruined me!

HE SMASHES DE BRIS UP AGAINST THE WALL.  THE CHAMPAGNE GOES
FLYING.

                         DE BRIS
                   (shrieking)
            Help!  Help!  He's crazy!  He's
            going to kill me.  Call the police!
            Call the police!  Help, help,
            murder, murder, rape, rape!!!

BIALYSTOCK THROWS HIM OUT, SLAMS THE DOOR AND LOCKS IT.  HE
FALLS INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS HIS FEET UP ON THE DESK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (moaning)
            How could this happen?  I was so
            careful.  I picked the wrong play,
            the wrong director, the wrong cast.
            Where did I go right?  We forgot
            one important, Bloom.  Adolf Hitler
            always drew a crowd.

BIALYSTOCK IS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT BLOOM IS DOING STRANGE
THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you doing?

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS FEVERISHLY PILING LEDGERS AND ACCOUNT
BOOKS TOGETHER.  HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, CLUTCHES
THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR.

                         BLOOM
                   (defensively)
            Don't try to stop me.  I've made up
            my mind.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you doing with those books?
            Where are you going?

                         BLOOM
                   (with hysterical conviction)
            I'm turning myself in.  It's the
            only way.  I'm going to cooperate
            with the authorities.  They'll
            reduce my sentence and then there's
            time off for good behavior.  And
            maybe I'll get a job in the prison
            library.  So long.

                                                           82.


HE TURNS THE KNOB.  THE DOOR IS LOCKED.  HE FIDDLES WITH THE
CATCH.  TOO LATE!  BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH.
HE BLOCKS THE DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (reasonably)
            Leo, take it easy.  Relax, you're
            overwrought.  You don't know what
            you're doing.  You're acting out of
            panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS!

BIALYSTOCK LUNGES AT BLOOM AND GRABS FOR THE BOOKS.  BLOOM
STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD.  THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND FORTH.

                         BLOOM
            I never should have listened to you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I never should have listened to you.

                         BLOOM
            Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Double.  Double.  Double.

WITH A MIGHTY WRENCH, BIALYSTOCK RIPS THE BOOKS OUT OF
BLOOM'S HANDS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (clutching the books triumphantly)
            Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!

BLOOM FLIPS.  HE ATTACKS BIALYSTOCK LIKE A CRAZY KID,
SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE
PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER.

                         BLOOM
                   (shrieking)
            FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!

BIALYSTOCK GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT.
BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM.  THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR LOCKED IN
MORTAL COMBAT.  SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND
TURN TOWARD THE DOOR.

CUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR.  THEY DROP OFF.  A LITTLE
SMOKE RISES FROM THE HOLE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (off screen, outside door)
            I am betrayed!

                                                           83.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

CUT TO THE DOOR.  IT FLIES OPEN.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS
FRANZ LIEBKIND, SMOKING LUGER IN HAND.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (solemnly)
            You have broken the Siegfried Oath.
            You must die.

HE BLASTS AWAY.  THE WINDOW IS SHATTERED.  PIECES OF WALL GO
WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR.  BIALYSTOCK DROPS THE LEDGERS AND
HE AND BLOOM DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE DESK.

                         LIEBKIND
            This is no good.  I'm not killing
            you.  Don't you understand, you
            have broken the Siegfried Oath.
            You must die.  Vill you cooperate!!!

CUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCRUNCHED
BEHIND DESK.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT.  THERE
IS A TIMOROUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
                   (together)
            Come in.  Come in.

ULLA ENTERS.

                         ULLA
            I hear noise.  You call?

SHE LOOKS AROUND.

                         ULLA
            Where are you?

SHE CONTINUES WALKING UNTIL SHE SEES THEM CROUCHED BEHIND
THE DESK.

                         ULLA
            Ahhh.  I see you.  You like
            something?  Coffee?

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN DISBELIEF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Coffee.  Yes.  That's a good idea.
                   (with great emphasis)
            Why don't you ask the gentleman
            with the gun... The gentleman who
            is shooting at us... and trying to
            kill us... what he will have.

                                                           84.


                         ULLA
                   (to Liebkind)
            You like coffee?

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER,
DUMBFOUNDED.

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes, please.  Black.  Two sugars.

ULLA REPEATS TO HERSELF AS SHE STARTS FOR THE DOOR.

                         ULLA
            Three coffees.  Two regular.  One
            black... two sugars.

SHE EXITS AND CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.

BIALYSTOCK LOOKS UP TO THE FATES AND MAKES A SMALL SOUND OF
DESPAIR.

                         LIEBKIND
            And now ve must resume hostilities.
            Are you coming out from behind that
            desk or not?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Not.

                         LIEBKIND
            Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.
            Clinging to life like baby
            butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and
            remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show
            you how to die like a man!

HE PLACES THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN AGAINST HIS TEMPLE.  BLOOM
AND BIALYSTOCK PEER OVER THE DESK TO SEE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (exhalted)
            Soon I vill be vit mine Fuhrer, und
            Goering, und Goebbels, and Himmler.
            I'm coming boys!

HE PULLS THE TRIGGER.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  THE GUN IS
JAMMED.  HE THROWS THE GUN DOWN IN DISGUST.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (in utter anguish)
            Boy, vhen things go wrong!

HE FALLS INTO A CHAIR AND SOBS LIKE A CHILD.

                                                           85.


                         LIEBKIND
            I'm a failure.  I'm a failure.  I'm
            a failure.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME OUT FROM BEHIND DESK.  BIALYSTOCK
LOOKS AT HIS WATCH.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day
            playing hide-and-seek with a crazy
            Kraut.

BIALYSTOCK PICKS UP LUGER.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (still sobbing)
            I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.

HE CONTINUES TO SOB.  BLOOM WALKS OVER TO THE WEEPING
LIEBKIND AND COMFORTINGLY PATS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.

                         BLOOM
            There, there.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (looking around)
            Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Liebkind)
            You crazy lunatic!  What are you
            shooting at us for?  Why don't you
            use this
                   (indicates gun)
            where it will do us some good?  Why
            don't you shoot the actors?
                   (the thought strikes home)
            Liebkind, have I ever steered you
            wrong?

                         LIEBKIND
            Always.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Never mind.  Listen.  Every night
            people are laughing at your beloved
            Fuhrer.  Why?

                         LIEBKIND
            It's that LSD und his verdampter
            babies!...

                                                           86.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (handing him the gun
                   and some money)
            Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill
            them all!

                         BLOOM
            What???

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom)
            Shut up.

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy
            the actors.

LIEBKIND STARTS TO GO.

                         BLOOM
            Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

HE LEAPS ACROSS THE ROOM AND WRENCHES THE GUN FROM LIEBKIND'S
HAND.

                         BLOOM
                   (screaming)
            Have you lost your mind?  What are
            you talking about?  Kill the actors.
            You can't kill the actors --
            they're not animals, they're human
            beings!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They are?  Have you ever eaten with
            one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!

                         BLOOM
            Liebkind, no!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom)
            What are you doing?  We're trapped.
            It's either the show or us.  There's
            no way out.  What can we do, blow
            up the theatre?

BIALYSTOCK FREEZES AS THE THOUGHT TAKES HOLD.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM.  HIS EYES NARROW AS HE SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERS THE PROPOSAL.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND.  HIS FACE A POSTER OF SHINING
APPROVAL.

                                                           87.


CAMERA PULLS BACK.  THE THREE OF THEM SEARCH EACH OTHER'S
FACES EARNESTLY.  THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY IN ACCORD.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN.  DARKENED CELLAR OF THEATRE.  WE SEE THE FAINT GLOW
OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL.  AS THE CAMERA
MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE
OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.
BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP.  LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK
LOOSE FROM WALL.  BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP.  BRICK COMES
LOOSE.  LIEBKIND REMOVES IT.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (the surgeon at work)
            Dynamite.

BLOOM SLAPS A NEATLY TAPED BUNDLE OF DYNAMITE INTO LIEBKIND'S
HAND.  LIEBKIND GENTLY PLACES IT IN OPENING.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fuse cap.

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS HIM A FUSE CAP.
LIEBKIND PUTS CAP IN PLACE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fuse.

BLOOM REACHES IN POCKET, TAKES OUT SPOOL OF FUSE, HANDS IT
TO LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
            Thank you.

LIEBKIND TIES FUSE IN PLACE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Gut.  Now for the master connection.

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AS THEY MOVE BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL.
LIEBKIND TRAILS FUSE FROM SPOOL.  THEY FINALLY EMERGE INTO
AN OPEN AREA OF CELLAR DIRECTLY BENEATH THE STAGE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Gut.  Now vhere's the other fuse?

BLOOM RAISES HIS LAMP, REVEALING A SIMILAR TUNNEL ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE CELLAR.

                         BLOOM
            There it is.

                                                           88.


CAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP SIMILAR FUSE PROTRUDING FROM SECOND
TUNNEL.

BACK TO SCENE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bloom)
            Pick it up and bring it here, please.

                         BLOOM
            Okay.

HE STARTS TOWARD SECOND TUNNEL.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (anxiously)
            Where are you going vit the light?

                         BLOOM
            I need it.  How'm I gonna find the
            fuse?

                         LIEBKIND
            Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one
            and all in the light.

THE THREE OF THEM GINGERLY TIPTOE OVER TO SECOND TUNNEL
ENTRANCE.  BLOOM PICKS UP THE FUSE.  THEY TIPTOE BACK.
BLOOM HANDS FUSE TO LIEBKIND.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS KNAPSACK, TAKES OUT LITTLE BLACK
METAL BOX WITH TWO TERMINAL CAPS AT EITHER END AND SETS IT
DOWN ON CELLAR FLOOR.

                         LIEBKIND
            Now ve take the two fuse leads,
            attach them to the terminals of the
            conductor and ve're in business.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (grinning)
            You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.

LIEBKIND BEGINS FIDDLING WITH THE FUSE LEADS AND TERMINALS.

                         BLOOM
            Max, I...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (irritated.  He has
                   not time for small talk)
            What is it?

                                                           89.


                         BLOOM
            Well, I... Well, it's just that...
            I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (smacking Bloom
                   affectionately on the shoulder)
            Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (mumbling to himself)
            Plus to minus.  Negative to positive.
            Male to...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come on.  Let's get going.

                         LIEBKIND
            Qviet.  Qviet  This is very
            important.

HE TURNS BACK TO HIS WORK.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vait a minute.  Vait a minute.
            Male to male?  Male to female?
            Female to male?  Female to female?
            Vait a minute.  In people, male to
            female.  But electricity is strange.
            It's male to male.

HE QUICKLY FINISHES THE CONNECTION.

                         LIEBKIND
            Sehr gut.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Slow fuse, please.

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS LIEBKIND A ROLL
OF FUSE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Thank you.

HE BEGINS TYING SLOW FUSE TO CONDUCTOR.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (as he works)
            Now ve take the slow fuse.  Tie one
            end to the master connection and
            the other ve attach to the detonator.

HE FINISHES CONNECTIONS.

                                                           90.


                         LIEBKIND
            Come, ve go to the detonator.

THEY BEGIN TO MOVE BACK AS LIEBKIND SLOWLY SPOOLS OUT FUSE.
THEY START UP THE STAIRS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vait a minute.  Are you sure this
            is slow fuse?  It feels like qvick
            fuse.
                   (to Bloom)
            Shine your light on it.

BLOOM SHINES LIGHT ON FUSE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I don't know.  I don't know.  The
            markings are so similar.  Qvick
            fuse or slow fuse?

LIEBKIND TAKES A WOODEN MATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET.

                         LIEBKIND
            I must find out.  It is critical.

HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE.  WHOOSH!  IT
IGNITES.  THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION.
LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK
BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH.  HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST
BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS
IT OUT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Let's face it.  That was dumb.

HE TROTS BACK.

                         LIEBKIND
            Boys, vhere is you?

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME CRAWLING OUT FROM BEHIND STAIRS.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (seeing them)
            Dot vas the qvick one.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We assumed that.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND SHOWS THEM A ROLL OF
FUSE.

                                                           91.


                         LIEBKIND
            Here.  You see.  This is the slow
            fuse.  It is much wider.  It has
            more resistance, more density.
            Therefore, it burns slower.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You mean you had the slow fuse in
            your pocket all the time and you
            forgot to put it on?

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes.  Amazing isn't it?

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS CANE AND SMASHES LIEBKIND ON THE
HELMET.  BONNNG.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You stupid kraut!

                         LIEBKIND
            Vhy do you always call me kraut?
            Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you
            hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not
            franks!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            All right.  Finish the job.  Let's
            get outta here.

CUT TO SIDE DOOR OF THEATRE.  THE DOOR OPENS SLOWLY.
BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND TIPTOE OUT.  BLOOM SETS
DETONATOR DOWN.

                         LIEBKIND
            Und now for the final connection.

HE WRAPS THE FUSE LEAD AROUND THE METAL CONTACT POLE AND
RAISES THE PLUNGER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Wait.  I'll check to see if the
            coast is clear.

HE RUNS TO THE END OF THE ALLEY.  LOOKS BOTH WAYS AND RUNS
BACK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            The coast is clear!

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  Get down.

                                                           92.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS.
LIEBKIND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR.  HIS EYES
SUDDENLY GLISTEN WITH TEARS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Goodbye, my foolish fancy.  Goodbye,
            my misbegotten child.  Goodbye, my
            tortured testament of twisted truths.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do it!  Do it!

LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE.  HE STARTS AND STOPS.

                         LIEBKIND
            I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a
            demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a
            monster... but it's still my child.

HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY.  BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE
AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN.
HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN
ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  NOTHING HAPPENS.  AFTER A
WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (quizzically)
            Nothing.

LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES
DETONATOR.

                         LIEBKIND
            Here is gut... of course, of course.
            In electricity, it's always male to
            female.  But with people, it's not
            always so.  Come ve must go back.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do you need us?

                         LIEBKIND
            Of course I need you.  It's dark in
            there.

                         BLOOM
            Okay, okay.  Let's not waste time.

THEY OPEN THE SIDE DOOR AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE THEATRE.

                         DRUNK
                   (off camera, singing)
            "Honeymoon, keep a shinin' in June,"

                                                           93.


CUT TO ENTRANCE OF ALLEY.  DRUNK COMES STAGGERING INTO VIEW.
HE SPOTS DETONATOR.

                         DRUNK
            "your silvery beams,
            Will light love's dreams,"  What
            the heck is that?  A bicycle pump?
            Naaah.  Lemme see.  Could it be?
            Good grief, it's Eli Whitney's
            cotton gin... Naaah.  Aahh, I know
            what it is.

HE WALKS OVER TO DETONATOR AND SITS ON FIRE STANCHION JUST
BEHIND IT.  HE RAISES HIS FOOT AND STARTS IT DOWN TOWARD THE
PLUNGER.

                         DRUNK
            Shine 'em up!

HE PUSHES PLUNGER DOWN WITH HIS FOOT.

CUT TO LONG SHOT OF THEATRE.  (MOCK UP) THERE IS A TERRIFIC
EXPLOSION.  PIECES OF THE THEATRE GO FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF DRUNK.  HE IS ON HIS KNEES.  DEBRIS
CRASHES ALL AROUND HIM.  SMOKE AND NOISE FILL THE AIR.  HE
STAGGERS TO HIS FEET.  HE ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AS THOUGH HE
WERE IN AN EARTHQUAKE.

                         DRUNK
                   (bravely singing)
            "Sa-an Fra-ancisco, open your
            golden gates,
            Don't let a stranger wait...

DISSOLVE TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE'S GAVEL SOLEMNLY RAPPING FOR
ORDER.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL CROWDED COURTROOM.

CAMERA MOVES IN TO FOREGROUND OF COURT.  THERE, SEATED AT
THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE ARE, IN ORDER, BLOOM WITH HIS ARM IN A
SLING, BIALYSTOCK WITH HIS LEG IN A CAST, AND A MUMMY
SWATHED IN BANDAGES.  WE KNOW THE MUMMY IS LIEBKIND BECAUSE
IT IS WEARING A GERMAN HELMET.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (mumbling through his bandages)
            Male to male?  Male to female?

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE.

                         JUDGE
            Has the jury reached a verdict?

                                                           94.


CUT TO JURY.  THEIR EXPRESSIONS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE NOT
AT ALL WELL-DISPOSED TOWARD THE DEFENDANTS.

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON FOREMAN.  HE RISES.

                         FOREMAN
            We have, your honor.

                         JUDGE
                   (off camera)
            How does the jury find?

                         FOREMAN
            We find the defendants incredibly
            guilty.

CUT TO JUDGE.

                         JUDGE
            Will the defendants please rise and
            approach the bench.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.  THEY STRUGGLE TO
THEIR FEET AND HOBBLE TO THE JUDGE'S BENCH.

                         JUDGE
            Do the defendants have anything to
            say in their behalf before the
            court pronounces sentence?

                         BLOOM
            I would like to say a word, sir,
            not on my behalf, but in behalf of
            my partner, Max Bialystock.

                         JUDGE
            Proceed.

                         BLOOM
            Thank you, your honor.  Max
            Bialystock is a very selfish man.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whispers to Bloom)
            Don't help me.

                         BLOOM
            He's a liar and a cheat and a
            scoundrel.  He's taken money from
            little old ladies.  He's talked
            people into doing things they never
            would have dreamed of.  Especially
            me.  But who has he really hurt?
                         (MORE)

                                                           95.


                         BLOOM (CONT'D)
            Who are the victims?  Not me, I had
            the most exciting adventure of my
            life.  And what about the little
            old ladies?  What would their lives
            have been without Max Bialystock?
            He made them feel wanted and young
            and attractive again.

            And may I humbly add, your honor,
            that we have learned our lesson and
            we'll never do it again.

                         JUDGE
            I will take that into consideration.

BIALYSTOCK NODS HIS HEAD IN ASSENT.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Good.  Let's fool around.  Now,

                   (trying to steer her

            So, the Count hired you this

            ... Watch the road.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I can't take my eyes off you.  How
            can I drive when you drive me mad.
            Mad.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (she squeals with delight)
            Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (upright)
            Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the

                   (he reaches down and
                   helps her off the couch)
            That's a good girl.
                   (leading her to the door)
            It's always such fun to see you.

BIALYSTOCK OPENS THE DOOR AND USHERS HER OUT ONTO THE LANDING.

            And after that we'll play the
            Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia
            ... And I'll play Lucretia.

CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS.  IT IS ALL TOO MUCH FOR HIM.  HE
LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.  SUDDENLY HIS EYES WIDEN IN SURPRISE,
AS HE DISCOVERS ANOTHER MAN HIDING IN THE NEXT DOORWAY.  THE
MAN PUTS A FINGER TO HIS LIPS INDICATING SILENCE.  THERE IS
NO PLACE LEFT FOR BLOOM TO LOOK.  HE LOOKS TO HEAVEN.

BACK TO LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, Thursday.  Will Thursday ever
            come?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            Like clockwork.

SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            I shall count the minutes.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!
                   (calling after her)
            Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ...
            Lucretia, Lucretia!

WE HEAR A MOUNTING CLATTER OF FOOTSTEPS AS THE LITTLE OLD
LADY FLIES BACK UP THE STAIRS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (eagerly)
            Yes???

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give
            me the check.  Can't produce a play
            without money, ha, ha, ha.

CUT TO BLOOM.  ONCE MORE HE STEALS A GLANCE AT THE STRANGER
HIDDEN IN THE SECOND DOORWAY.  ONCE AGAIN THE MAN GESTURES
FOR HIM TO BE SILENT.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY.

                                                           10.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (opening her handbag
                   and reaching inside)
            Of course, the check, I had it with
            me all the time.

SHE TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND HANDS IT TO HIM.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            I don't know what's happening to me.
            I must be getting old.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES CHECK AND READS IT.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Is it all right?  I made it out to
            cash.  You didn't tell me the name
            of the play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good.
            Bye.  Bye.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall
            count the minutes.

SHE STARTS TO DESCEND.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
                   (descending)
            Ta.  Ta.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (waving check at her)
            Ta.  Ta.

THE MAN, WHO HAS BEEN LURKING IN THE SECOND DOORWAY, SUDDENLY
SPRINGS INTO ACTION.  HE DARTS FORWARD AND QUICKLY TAKES THE
CHECK OUT OF BIALYSTOCK'S HAND.

                         THE MAN (LANDLORD)
            He who signs a lease, must pay rent.

HE SHOVES THE CHECK INTO HIS POCKET AND STARTS DOWN THE
STAIRS.

                         LANDLORD
            That's the law.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Murderer!  Thief!  How can you take
            the last penny out of a man's pocket?

                                                           11.


                         LANDLORD
                   (turns back, shrugs)
            I have to ... I'm a landlord!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting to heaven)
            Oh Lord, hear my plea.  Destroy him.
            He maketh a blight on the land.

CUT TO LANDLORD ON THE WAY DOWN.

                         LANDLORD
                   (to the Lord)
            Don't pay attention.  He's crazy.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE TURNS TO RE-ENTER HIS OFFICE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (biting his knuckle)
            Nnnnn.  That hurt.
                   (he sighs)
            I'll have to make another call.

HE STARTS IN AND STOPS.  HE NOTICES BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom, quietly)
            Have you been there all this time?

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And did you see and hear everything?

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then what do you have to say for
            yourself?

                         BLOOM
            Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouts)
            Who are you?  What do you want?
            Why are you loitering in my hallway?
            Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you
            speak?

                         BLOOM
            Scared.  Can't talk.

                                                           12.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            All right.  Get a hold of yourself.
            Take a deep breath, let it out
            slowly and tell me who you are.

                         BLOOM
                   (breathes deeply.
                   Words tumble from his
                   mouth as he exhales)
            I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant,
            I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was
            sent here to do your books and I'm
            terribly sorry I caught you with
            the old lady.
                   (he has run out of breath)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Caught you with the old lady."
            Come in, Mr. Tact.

CUT TO OFFICE.  THEY ENTER.  BLOOM ENTERS TIMOROUSLY.  HE
DOESN'T KNOW QUITE WHERE TO GO.  HE LOOKS TO BIALYSTOCK FOR
GUIDANCE.  BIALYSTOCK STUDIES BLOOM CURIOUSLY FROM HEAD TO
TOE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So you're an accountant, eh?

                         BLOOM
                   (timidly)
            Yes sir.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then account for yourself!  Do you
            believe in God?  Do you believe in
            gold?  Why are you looking up old
            lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert,
            eh?

BLOOM, WHO HAS BEEN QUAKING UNDER THE ASSAULT, REACHES INTO
HIS POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE TATTERED CORNER OF AN OLD BLUE
BABY BLANKET.  HE TWISTS THE BLUE BLANKET NERVOUSLY IN HIS
HANDS.

                         BLOOM
            Sir, I ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Never mind.  Never mind.  Do the
            books.  They're in that desk over
            there.  Top drawer.

                                                           13.


BLOOM DUTIFULLY GOES TO DESK.  OPENS TOP DRAWER AND BEGINS
REMOVING BOOKS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How dare you condemn me without
            knowing all the facts.

                         BLOOM
            But sir, I'm not condem ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical
            conversation.
                   (to himself)
            How humiliating.  Max Bialystock.
            Max Bialystock.

BIALYSTOCK SUDDENLY WHEELS AND SHOUTS AT BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You know who I used to be?  Max
            Bialystock!  The King of Broadway!
            Six shows running at once.  Lunch
            at Delmonico's.  Two hundred dollar
            suits.  Look at me.  Look at me now!
            I'm wearing a cardboard belt!

HE RIPS THE BELT OFF AND HOLDS IT IN THE AIR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I used to have thousands of
            investors begging, pleading, to put
            their money into a Max Bialystock
            production.

HE PICKS UP THE PICTURE ON DESK ('HOLD ME, TOUCH ME') TAKES
IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR PICTURES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Look at my investors now.  Voila!
                   (gestures at pictures)
            Hundreds of little old ladies
            stopping off at Max Bialystock's
            office to grab a last thrill on the
            way to the cemetery.

HE PUTS PICTURE BACK IN ITS PLACE.  LOOKS TOWARD BLOOM.

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED BY THE GREAT MAN'S
DILEMMA.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.

                                                           14.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You have exactly ten seconds to
            change that disgusting look of pity
            into one of enormous respect.  One
            ... Two ...

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do the books!  Do the books!

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS GREATLY RELIEVED.

                         BLOOM
                   (sighing)
            Yes, sir.  Thank you.

HE PLUNGES INTO HIS WORK.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE GOES TO WINDOW, LOOKS OUT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            Window's so filthy, can't tell if
            it's day or night out there.

HE WIPES WINDOW WITH HIS CUFF.  LOOKS AT WINDOW.  NO GOOD.
LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF.  GRIMACES.  FROM HIS DESK HE TAKES
THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES
IT AGAINST THE WINDOW.  HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE.  HE LOOKS
OVER HIS SHOULDER AT BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING.  BLOOM
IS WATCHING.  THEIR EYES MEET.  BLOOM'S EYES RETREAT.
BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW
DOWN INTO THE STREET.

CAMERA:  SHOT OF STREET.  BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW.  A
WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (voice over as camera
                   follows Rolls)
            Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce.
            That's it baby, when you got it,
            flaunt it.

                         BLOOM
                   (off screen)
            Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ...
            harrumph ...

                                                           15.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            I assume you are making those
            cartoon noises to attract my
            attention.  Am I correct in my
            assumption, you fish-faced enemy of
            the people?

BLOOM IS WOUNDED.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I have hurt your feelings.

BLOOM NODS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Good, what is it?

                         BLOOM
            Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (looking at his watch)
            Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.

                         BLOOM
            Well, sir, it seems ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            You have forty-eight seconds left.
            Hurry.  Hurry.

                         BLOOM
                   (speedily)
            In looking at your books, I've
            discovered that ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry,
            you're using up your time.

IN HIS ANXIETY, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET
TAKES OUT THE OLD BLUE BLANKET AND NERVOUSLY STROKES HIS
CHEEK WITH IT.

                         BLOOM
            Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function
            under these conditions.

BIALYSTOCK CURIOUSLY EYES THE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            You're making me extremely nervous.

                                                           16.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            What is that?  A handkerchief?

BLOOM QUICKLY BEGINS TO PUT AWAY HIS BLUE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            It's nothing ... nothing.

QUICK AS A FLASH, BIALYSTOCK REACHES OVER AND SNATCHES IT
OUT OF BLOOM'S HAND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            If it's nothing, why can't I see it?

BLOOM LEAPS UP IN HOT PURSUIT OF HIS BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
                   (shrieking in panic)
            My blanket.  Give me my blue blanket.

BIALYSTOCK, TAKEN ABACK, HURRIEDLY GIVES THE BLANKET BACK TO
BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here, don't panic.

                         BLOOM
                   (clutching his blanket)
            I'm sorry ... I don't like people
            touching my blue blanket.  It's not
            important.  It's a minor compulsion.
            I can deal with it if I want to.
            It's just that I've had it ever
            since I was a baby and ... and ...
            I find it very comforting.

HE KISSES IT AND SHOVES IT INTO HIS POCKET.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself)
            They come here.  They all come here.
            How do they find me?

                         BLOOM
                   (recovering his dignity)
            Mr. Bialystock ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do
            for you?

                                                           17.


                         BLOOM
            This is hardly a time for levity.
            I've discovered a serious error
            here in the accounts of your last
            play.

BIALYSTOCK MOVES AROUND THE DESK TO EXAMINE THE LEDGER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Where?  What?

                         BLOOM
            According to the backer's list you
            raised $60,000.  But the show you
            produced only cost fifty-eight
            thousand.  There's two thousand
            dollars unaccounted for.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I went to a Turkish bath, who cares?
            The show was a flop.  What
            difference does it make?

                         BLOOM
            It makes a great deal of difference.
            That's fraud.  If they found out,
            you could go to prison.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why should they find out?  It's
            only two thousand dollars,  Bloom,
            do me a favor, move a few decimal
            points around.  You can do it.
            You're an accountant.  The word
            'count' is part of your title.

                         BLOOM
                   (aghast)
            But that's cheating!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's not cheating ... It's charity.
            Bloom, look at me ... look at me!
            I'm drowning.  Other men sail
            through life.  Bialystock has
            struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going
            under.  I am being sunk by a
            society that demands success, when
            all I can offer is failure.  Bloom,
            I'm reaching out to you.  Don't
            send me to jail.  Help!  Help!

                                                           18.


DURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES
INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT
ACROSS HIS CHEEK.

                         BLOOM
            Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (faintly)
            Help!

                         BLOOM
            All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could
            con you.

                         BLOOM
            Oh, it's all right ... wha?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.

                         BLOOM
                   (pouring over the accounts)
            Now let's see, two thousand dollars.
            That isn't much.  I'm sure I can
            hide it somewhere.  After all, the
            department of internal revenue
            isn't interested in a show that
            flopped.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You
            figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm
            gonna take a little nap.
                   (crossing to couch)
            Wake me if there's a fire.

HE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH.

CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
            Now let's see, if we add these
            figures, we get ...

CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING
DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES.  HE COMES TO THE END AND
IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW.

BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.  HE COMPARES PAGES.

                                                           19.


                         BLOOM
                   (musing to himself)
            Heh, heh, heh, amazing.  It's
            absolutely amazing.  But under the
            right circumstances, a producer
            could make more money with a flop
            than he could with a hit.

QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE.  HIS EYES POP OPEN.

CUT BACK TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
            Yes.  Yes.  It's quite possible.
            If he were certain the show would
            fail, a man could make a fortune.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM.
HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS.  HE MOVES TO
BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR
MORE INFORMATION.  BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE
THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes???

BLOOM LOOKS UP.  HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO
CLOSE TO HIS OWN.

                         BLOOM
                   (at a loss)
            Yes, what?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What you were saying.  Keep talking.

                         BLOOM
            What was I saying?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You were saying that under the
            right circumstances, a producer
            could make more money with a flop
            than he could with a hit.

                         BLOOM
                   (smiling)
            Yes, it's quite possible.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You keep saying that, but you don't
            tell me how.  How could a producer
            make more money with a flop than
            with a hit?

                                                           20.


BLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES
BIALYSTOCK.  HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A
STUDENT.

                         BLOOM
            It's simply a matter of creative
            accounting.  Let us assume, just
            for the moment, that you are a
            dishonest man.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Assume away!

                         BLOOM
            Well, it's very easy.  You simply
            raise more money than you really
            need.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What do you mean?

                         BLOOM
            You've done it yourself, only you
            did it on a very small scale.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What did I do?

                         BLOOM
            You raised two thousand more than
            you needed to produce your last play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So what?  What did it get me?  I'm
            wearing a cardboard belt.

                         BLOOM
            Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made
            your error.  You didn't go all the
            way.  You see, if you were really a
            bold criminal, you could have
            raised a million.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            But the play only cost $60,000 to
            produce.

                         BLOOM
            Exactly.  And how long did it run?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            One night.

                                                           21.


                         BLOOM
            See?  You could have raised a
            million dollars, put on a sixty
            thousand dollar flop and kept the
            rest.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            But what if the play was a hit?

                         BLOOM
            Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play
            were a hit, you'd have to pay off
            the backers, and with so many
            backers there could never be enough
            profits to go around, get it?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So,
            in order for the scheme to work,
            we'd have to find a sure fire flop.

                         BLOOM
            What scheme?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What scheme?  Your scheme, you
            bloody little genius.

                         BLOOM
            Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no
            scheme.  I merely posed a little,
            academic accounting theory.  It's
            just a thought.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bloom, worlds are turned on such
            thoughts!

BIALYSTOCK STARTS MOVING IN ON BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Don't you see, Bloom.  Darling,
            Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so
            simple.  Step one:  We find the
            worst play in the world -- a sure
            flop.  Step two:  I raise a million
            dollars -- there's a lot of little
            old ladies in this world.  Step
            three:  You go back to work on the
            books.  Phoney lists of backers --
            one for the government, one for us.
            You can do it, Bloom, you're a
            wizard.
                         (MORE)

                                                           22.


                         BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
            Step four:  We open on Broadway and
            before you can say 'step five' we
            close on Broadway.  Step six:  We
            take our million dollars and fly to
            Rio de Janiero.

BIALYSTOCK GRABS BLOOM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGINS TO LEAD HIM IN
A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (sings)
            "Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo,
            myo, meo ... "

                         BLOOM
                   (afraid of the
                   scheme, afraid of the
                   dance, afraid of Bialystock)
            Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please.
            You're holding me too tight.  I'm
            an honest man.  You don't understand.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (leading Bloom as he talks)
            No, Bloom, you don't understand.
            This is fate, this is destiny.
            There's no avoiding it.

AT THIS POINT, BIALYSTOCK SWEEPS BLOOM INTO AN ELABORATE DIP.

                         BLOOM
                   (the back of his head
                   practically touching
                   the floor)
            Mr. Bialystock, not more than five
            minutes ago, against my better
            judgment, I doctored your books.
            That, sir, is the ultimate extent
            of my criminal life.

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS FISTS TO THE HEAVENS IN DESPAIR.
BLOOM, EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT, GOES CRASHING
TO THE FLOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!  OOOOOHH!
            OOOOOHH!  I WANT THAT MONEY!

CAMERA ON BLOOM AS HE LIES STRICKEN ON THE FLOOR.

                                                           23.


                         BLOOM
                   (to himself)
            Oh, I fell on my keys.
                   (he shifts slightly
                   to make himself more comfortable)
            I've got to get out of here.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (angrily hovering
                   over Bloom)
            You miserable, cowardly, wretched
            little caterpillar.  Don't you ever
            want to become a butterfly?  Don't
            you want to spread your wings and
            flap your way to glory?

BIALYSTOCK FLAPS HIS ARMS LIKE A HUGE PREDATORY BIRD.

                         BLOOM
                   (his eyes widened in terror)
            You're going to jump on me.

BIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY.

                         BLOOM
            You're going to jump on me.  I know
            you're going to jump on me -- like
            Nero jumped on Poppea.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (nonplussed)
            What???

                         BLOOM
                   (by now he is shrieking)
            Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she
            was unfaithful to him.  So he got
            mad and he jumped on her.  Up and
            down, up and down, until he squashed
            her like a bug.  Please don't jump
            on me.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting and jumping
                   up and down next to Bloom)
            I'm not going to jump on you!

                         BLOOM
                   (rolling away in terror)
            Aaaaaaaaaa!

                                                           24.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (hoisting Bloom to
                   his feet)
            Will you get a hold on yourself.

                         BLOOM
                   (up on his feet and
                   running for cover)
            Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!

HE RUNS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM.  TRAPPED!  HE TURNS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you afraid of?  I'm not
            going to hurt you!  What's the
            matter with you?

                         BLOOM
            I'm hysterical.  I'm having
            hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I
            can't stop.  When I get like this,
            I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK.  PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER
AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE.

                         BLOOM
            I'm wet!  I'm wet!  I'm hysterical
            and I'm wet!

BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS,
SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

                         BLOOM
                   (holding his face)
            I'm in pain!  And I'm wet!  And I'm
            still hysterical!

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN.

                         BLOOM
            No!  No!  Don't hit.  It doesn't
            help.  It only increases my sense
            of danger.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What can I do?  What can I do?
            You're getting me hysterical.

                         BLOOM
            Go away from me.  You frighten me.
                   (he indicates the sofa)
            Sit over there.

                                                           25.


BIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (exasperated)
            Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that
            better?

                         BLOOM
            It's a little better, but you still
            look angry.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How's this?
                   (he smiles sweetly)


                         BLOOM
            Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's
            very nice.  I think I'm coming out
            of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm
            definitely coming out of it.  Thank
            you for smiling.  It helped a great
            deal.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (for want of something
                   sensible)
            Well, you know what they say,
            "Smile and the world smiles with
            you."  Heh, heh.
                   (to himself)
            The man should be in a straight
            jacket.
                   (to Bloom)
            Feeling better?

                         BLOOM
            Much, thank you.  But I am a little
            lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat
            something.  Hysterics have a way of
            severely depleting one's blood
            sugar, you know.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They certainly do.  They certainly
            do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.

                         BLOOM
            That's very kind of you, Mr.
            Bialystock, but I ...

                                                           26.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy.  I
            lowered your blood sugar, but least
            I could do is raise it a little.

BLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And I promise you faithfully, I
            won't discuss that silly scheme to

BIALYSTOCK DONS HIS CAPE AND "BELASCO" HAT.  FROM A RACK HE
SELECTS A GOLD-TOPPED WALKING STICK.  HE GOES TO DOOR, OPENS
IT, AND WITH A GRAND FLOURISH, MOTIONS BLOOM TO PRECEDE HIM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Avanti!

BLOOM GRACIOUSLY COMPLIES.  THEY EXIT.

CUT TO EXTERIOR.  ENTRANCE OF BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE BUILDING.

THE DOOR OPENS.  IT IS HELD BY BIALYSTOCK.  BLOOM EXITS
BUILDING INTO STREET.

                         BLOOM
                   (to Bialystock, who
                   is holding door)
            Thank you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Je vous empris.

THEY TURN UP 45TH STREET AND HEAD TOWARD BROADWAY.
BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND COUNTS HIS MONEY.  HE
LOOKS WORRIED.  SUDDENLY HIS FACE BRIGHTENS.

WE SEE WHAT BIALYSTOCK SEES.

CUT TO MURRAY THE BLINDMAN WORKING 45TH STREET.

CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

BIALYSTOCK DROPS A STEP BEHIND, QUICKLY TAKES OFF HIS HAT
AND FLINGS IT THROUGH THE AIR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (pointing to his hat)
            My hat.

                         BLOOM
            I'll get it.

                                                           27.


HE RACES AFTER IT.

BIALYSTOCK DETOURS SLIGHTLY TOWARD MURRAY THE BLINDMAN, WHO
WEARS A LARGE CARDBOARD SIGN WITH THE LEGEND: "MURRAY THE
BLINDMAN.  YOU CAN SEE.  I CAN'T.  GIVE!"  INSCRIBED ON IT.
BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN INTO HIS CUP AND GRABS A FIST FULL
OF COINS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Murray, I'm going to lunch.  I took
            two dollars.

                         MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
            Okay, Bialy, that makes six eighty
            you owe me.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I know.  Don't worry.  You'll get
            it.  You'll get it.

                         MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
                   (tapping his way along)
            Well, don't forget about it.  I
            need it.  Nobody understands.  I'm
            competing with giants.  The Greater
            New York Fund.  The March of Dimes.
            The Community Chest.  They're
            driving me out of business.

BLOOM COMES DASHING BACK WITH HAT IN HAND.

                         BLOOM
                   (out of breath)
            I got it, Mr. Bialystock.

HE PROFFERS HAT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK TAKES IT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max.
            You know, I don't let everybody
            call me Max.  It's only people I
            really like.

                         BLOOM
                   (trying it on)
            Okay ... Max!  And you can call me
            Leo.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I already have.  Come on.

                         BLOOM
            Oh.

                                                           28.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Where would you like to eat?

                         BLOOM
            Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What
            do you think, Max?

BIALYSTOCK QUIETLY WINCES AT THE SURFEIT OF MAX.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Let me see ... it's such a beautiful
            day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've
            got it!  Let's go to Coney Island!
            We'll lunch at the sea shore.

                         BLOOM
            Coney Island??

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you
            like Coney Island?

                         BLOOM
            I ... I love it.  I haven't been
            there since I was a kid.  But it's
            nearly two o'clock.  I really
            should be getting back to Whitehall
            and Marks.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and
            Marks are concerned, you're working
            with Bialystock, right?

                         BLOOM
            Right.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Then stick with Bialystock!

                   (to Custard Man)
            We'll have another round.

                         CUSTARD MAN
            What kind now, sports?

                                                           29.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            What kind now, Leo?

                         BLOOM
                   (he's loosening up)
            I don't know.  Let's see.  We've
            had chocolate, vanilla, banana -
            let's go green.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Custard Man)
            Two pistachios, my good man.

                         CUSTARD MAN
            I'm not your good man, I happen to
            own this establishment.
                   (he turns to fill the order)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Everybody's a big shot.
                   (turns to Bloom)
            Well, Leo, are you having a good
            time?

                         BLOOM
            I don't know.  I think so.  I feel
            very strange.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Maybe you're happy.

                         BLOOM
            Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well,
            whatta ya think of that.  Happy.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ON THE WHIP (A CONEY
ISLAND RIDE).  THEY ARE TIGHTLY SQUEEZED INTO ONE OF THE
MOVING SEATS.  THEY ARE BETWEEN "WHIPS".

                         BLOOM
                   (licking his pistachio
                   custard.  He is ecstatic)
            I love it.  I love it.  Get set.
            We're coming to another turn.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (working, relentlessly
                   working on Bloom)
            Bloom, it can always be like this.
            Life can be beautiful.  Let me show
            you.  Stick with ...

THEY HIT THE TURN.

                                                           30.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BARKER SELLING TICKETS IN FRONT OF TUNNEL
OF LOVE.  MEDIUM SHOT OF EXIT.  A LITTLE BOAT COMES OUT.  IN
IT ARE A MAN AND A WOMAN EMBRACING.  IT IS FOLLOWED BY
ANOTHER.  IN IT THERE IS A SAILOR KISSING A GIRL.  BOAT
NUMBER THREE COMES OUT.  IN IT ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

CLOSE IN TO A TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BLOOM IS MESMERIZED.
BIALYSTOCK SPEAKS IN A SOFT, ENCHANTING TONE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Money is honey.  Money is honey.
            Money can put soft things next to
            your skin.  Silk ... satin ... women.

CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S EYES.  THEY WIDEN ON THE WORD "WOMEN."

QUICK DISSOLVE TO PARACHUTE JUMP.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE
SEATED IN A LITTLE GONDOLA THAT SWINGS BENEATH A HUGE
PARACHUTE.  THEY ARE BUCKLING THEMSELVES IN.

                         BLOOM
            But if we're caught, we'll go to
            prison.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (sensing victory, he
                   marshals his forces
                   for the final assault)
            You think you're not in prison now?
            Living in a grey little room.
            Going to a grey little job.  Leading
            a grey little life.

                         BLOOM
            You're right.  You're absolutely
            right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my
            life counting other people's
            money -- people I'm smarter than,
            better than.  Where's my share?
            Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want,
            I want, I want, I want everything
            I've ever seen in the movies!

THE PARACHUTE BEGINS TO ASCEND.  WE FOLLOW.

                         BLOOM
                   (coming out of it)
            Hey, we're going up.

                                                           31.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You bet your boots, Leo.  It's
            Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise.
            Upward and onward.  Say, you'll
            join me.  Nothing can stop us.

BIALYSTOCK OFFERS HIS HAND TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (shouting at the top
                   of his lungs)
            I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!

BLOOM GRABS BIALYSTOCK'S HAND AND SHAKES IT FIRMLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            This is where we belong, Leo.  On
            top of the world.  Top of the world!

THEY HIT THE TOP.  THE PARACHUTE IS RELEASED, THEY QUICKLY
PLUMMET DOWN.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Oiiiiiii!!!

                         BLOOM
            Ohhhhhhhh!!!

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM DROP OUT OF FRAME.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.  NIGHT.  OVERHEAD SHOT.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE BATHED IN A SMALL POOL OF
CONCENTRATED LIGHT.  THEY ARE DOWN TO THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES.
THEY ARE FEVERISHLY READING PLAY MANUSCRIPTS.  ALL ABOUT
THEM ARE STREWN COFFEE CONTAINERS, SOME EMPTY, SOME HALF-
FILLED.  THERE IS A HUGE PILE OF DISCARDED SCRIPTS ON THE
FLOOR.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LEO BLOOM AS HE READS SCRIPT.  HE LOOKS
UP, PUSHES HIS GLASSES BACK AND MASSAGES THE BRIDGE OF HIS
NOSE.

                         BLOOM
            Max, let's call it a night.  It's
            two in the morning.  I don't know
            what I'm reading anymore.

PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Read, read.  We've got to find the
            worst play ever written.

                                                           32.


BIALYSTOCK TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO A NEW SCRIPT.  HE CRACKS
IT OPEN AND BEGINS READING.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Hmmnn.  "Gregor Samsa awoke one
            morning to find he had been
            transformed into a giant cock-a-
            roach."

IN A RAGE BIALYSTOCK FLINGS THE MANUSCRIPT ONTO THE PILE OF
DISCARDS AS HE BELLOWS:

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's good!!!

CAMERA MOVES UP AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO MEDIUM SHOT OF
OFFICE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE THOROUGHLY DISHEVELED AND
BADLY IN NEED OF A SHAVE.

                         BLOOM
                   (mumbling to himself
                   as he reads)
            Wait a minute, I've read this part.
            I'm reading plays I read this
            morning.

HE GETS UP, STRETCHES, GOES TO WINDOW AND RAISES SHADE.
SUNLIGHT FLOODS THE ROOM.  HE REELS BACK AS THOUGH STRUCK.

                         BLOOM
            Good lord, it's morning.  Let's
            face it, we'll never find it.
                   (he turns to face Bialystock)
            Max, tomorrow's another day.
            Today's another day.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (off-camera.  Crazy
                   little voice)
            We'll never find it, eh?  We'll
            never find it, eh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha,
            ha.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE IS STANDING.  AT HIS FEET LIES A
SCRIPT.  HE DANCES AROUND IT, HIS ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HIS
CHEST.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (as he does an insane
                   little jig around the script)
            You can't smell it when it's under
            your nose.  You can't see it when
            it's right before your eyes.

                         BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
            You can't feel it when it's in your
            hand, when it's in your pocket.

CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT.

                         BLOOM
            Max, what is it?  What are you
            doing?  What's happening?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'll tell you what's happening.
            We've struck gold.  Not fool's
            gold, but real gold.  The mother
            lode.  The mother lode.  The mother
            of them all.

                         BLOOM
                   (brightening)
            You found a flop!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            A flop, ha!  That's putting it
            mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe!
            An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close-
            in-one-night beauty!

HE BENDS DOWN, PICKS UP THE SCRIPT AND SHAKES IT IN BLOOM'S
FACE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            This is freedom from want forever.
            This is a house in the country.
            This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley.
            This is wine, women and song and
            women.

BLOOM SNATCHES THE SCRIPT FROM HIS HANDS AND READS ALOUD THE
TITLE.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP.  TITLE OF SCRIPT.

            "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, A Gay Romp
            with Adolph and Eva in
            Berchtesgarten."  Fantastic!

BACK TO TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's practically a love letter to
            Hitler!

                                                           34.

                   (ecstatic)
            It won't run a week!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This
            play has got to close in the first
            act.

            Here it is -- 415.

THEY MARCH UP STOOP TO NUMBER 415.  THEIR MOTION IS ARRESTED
BY A QUERULOUS COMMAND ISSUED IN PHLEGMATIC TONES BY THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF THE BUILDING (A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES)
WHO IS LEANING OUT OF HER WINDOW WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE

            Who do you want?  No one gets in

            want ... I'm the concierge.  My
            husband used to be the concierge.
            He's dead.  Now I'm the concierge.

            floor.  Apartment twenty-three.

                         BLOOM
            Thank you.

THEY START INTO THE BUILDING.

                                                           35.


                         SUPER
            But you won't find him there.  He's
            up on the roof with his birds.  He
            keeps birds.  Dirty, disgusting,
            filthy, lice-ridden birds.  You
            used to be able to sit out on the
            stoop like a person.  Not anymore.
            No sir.  Birds!  You get my drift?

                         BLOOM
            We ... uh ... get your drift.
            Thank you, Madam.

                         SUPER
            I'm not a madam.  I'm a concierge.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE BUILDING.

CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FORTIES.  HE IS
WEARING, AS ALWAYS, A GERMAN HELMET.  HE CROUCHES BESIDE A
HUGE PIGEON COOP.  IN HIS LEFT HAND HE TENDERLY HOLDS A
PIGEON.  IN HIS RIGHT, A SMALL PHOTO OF ADOLPH HITLER.  HE
SHOWS THE PICTURE TO THE BIRD.  HE MOVES IT BACK AND FORTH
UNTIL HE IS SURE THE BIRD IS FOCUSED ON IT PROPERLY.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to pigeon)
            Hilda, look ... look good ...
            Hilda, you're not looking.  Hilda,
            if he lives, I know you will find
            him.

HE KISSES THE BIRD AND TOSSES IT SKYWARD.

CUT TO ROOF DOOR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER ONTO THE ROOF.
THEY LOOK FOR LIEBKIND.  HE IS NOT ON THAT SIDE OF ROOF.
THEY WALK AROUND TO OTHER SIDE.  AS SOON AS THEY TURN THE
CORNER, THEY SPOT LIEBKIND CROUCHED NEAR THE COOP.

                         BLOOM
                   (quietly to Bialystock)
            He's wearing a German helmet.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a fierce whisper)
            Shhh.  Don't say anything to offend
            him.  We need that play.
                   (cups his hands to
                   his mouth and calls
                   up to the coop)
            Franz Liebkind?

LIEBKIND IS NOT AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE UNTIL HE HEARS HIS
NAME CALLED.

                                                           36.


STARTLED, HE QUICKLY FLIPS HITLER'S PICTURE UNDER HIS HELMET.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (he speaks with a
                   German accent)
            I vas never a member of the Nazi
            party.  I am not responsible.  I
            only followed orders.  Who are you?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't
            understand.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers
            are in order.  I love my country.
                   (he sings)
            "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,
            For amber vaves of grain."

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Mr. Liebkind, wait ...

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing)
            "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (interrupting)
            Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're
            not from the government.  We came
            here to talk to you about your play.

                         LIEBKIND
            My play?  You mean, "Springtime For
            ... " you know who?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vat about it?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We loved it.  We thought it was a
            masterpiece.  That's why we're here.
            We want to produce it on Broadway.

                         LIEBKIND
            You're not, as you Americans say,
            dragging my leg, are you?

                                                           37.


                         BLOOM
            No, not at all sir, we're quite
            serious.  We want to produce your
            play.
                   (he reaches into his
                   attache case and
                   displays a legal
                   looking document)
            I have the contracts right here.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (looking up)
            Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of
            dreams!  I can't believe it.
                   (he turns to the pigeons)
            Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto,
            Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do
            you hear?  Ve are going to clear
            the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly,
            spread the words.

HE OPENS THE CAGES AND SETS THE BIRDS FREE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing at the top
                   of his lungs)
            "Deutchland, Deutchland, uber
            alles, Uber alles in der velt."

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN ALARM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (singing for all he's worth)
            "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "

                         BLOOM
                   (shouting)
            Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.

LIEBKIND STOPS SINGING.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vat?

                         BLOOM
            People can hear you.

                         LIEBKIND
            OH.
                   (he sings)
            "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee
            Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is
            not place to talk.  Come!

                         LIEBKIND (CONT'D)
            We go to my flat.  An occasion like
            this calls for Schnapps.

DISSOLVE TO FRANZ LIEBKIND'S APARTMENT.  LIEBKIND HAS JUST
FINISHED POURING THREE GLASSES OF SCHNAPPS.  HE PUTS THE
BOTTLE ON A TRAY.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (as he hands glasses
                   to Bialystock and Bloom)
            Mr. Bloom, Mr. Bialystock.
            Gentleman, with your permission, I
            would like to propose a toast to
            the greatest man that ever lived.
            Let us say his name quietly to
            ourselves.  The walls have ears.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF FRANZ LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (a fervent whisper)
            Adolph Hitler.
                   (he downs drink)


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (whisper)
            Sigmund Freud.
                   (he downs drink)


CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whisper)
            Max Bialystock.
                   (he downs drink)


BACK TO SCENE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I vas vit him a great deal, you know.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            With whom?

                                                           39.


                         LIEBKIND
                   (astonished by the question)
            Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He
            liked me.  Out of all the household
            staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his
            favorite.  I vas the only one
            allowed into his chambers at bedtime.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No kidding?

                         LIEBKIND
            Oh, sure.  I used to take him his
            hot milk and his opium.  Achhh,
            those were the days.  Vat good
            times ve had.  Dinner parties vit
            lovely ladies and gentlemen,
            singing und dancing.  You know, not
            many people knew about it, but the
            Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Really, I never dreamed ...

                         LIEBKIND
                   (flies into an
                   indignant rage)
            That's because you were taken in by
            that verdampter Allied propaganda.
            Such filthy lies.  But nobody said
            a bad vord about Winston Churchill,
            did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!
                   (he gestures V for victory)
            Churchill, vit his cigars and his
            brandy and his rotten paintings.
            Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would
            say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not
            Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me
            tell this, and you're getting it
            straight from the horse, Hitler vas
            better looking than Churchill, he
            vas a better dresser than Churchill,
            had more hair, told funnier jokes,
            and could dance the pants off
            Churchill!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (swinging along)
            That's exactly why we want to do
            this play.  To show the world the
            true Hitler, the Hitler you knew,
            the Hitler you loved, the Hitler
            with a song in his heart.

                   (to Bloom)
            Leo, quick, the contract.

BLOOM QUICKLY WHIPS THE CONTRACT OUT OF HIS POCKET, PRODUCES
A PEN, HANDS THEM TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK SPREADS THE
CONTRACT OUT ON THE TABLE BEFORE LIEBKIND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind.
            And make your dream a reality.

HE HANDS LIEBKIND THE PEN.  LIEBKIND REFUSES IT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Wait.  No.  How do I know I can
            trust you?  How do I know you vill
            present this play in the manner and
            spirit in vhich it vas conceived?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We swear it!

                         LIEBKIND
            Not good enough... Vould you be
            villing to take the Siegfried oath?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  We would!

INSERT:  CLOSE-UP BLOOM.  HE LOOKS WORRIED.

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  I will make the preparations.

LIEBKIND LEAVES THE ROOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (anxious whisper)
            Max, I don't want to take any
            Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what
            it is, but I don't want to take it.
            We might end up in the German Army.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless
            nut.  Play along with him.  It's
            almost in the bag.

LIEBKIND ENTERS.  HE IS LADEN DOWN WITH ALL SORTS OF
RITUALISTIC PARAPHERNALIA.  LIEBKIND PLACES ALL THE STUFF ON
THE TABLE.  WITHOUT A WORD TO THEM, HE GOES TO PHONOGRAPH.

                                                           41.


IN A FEW SECONDS WE HEAR THE OPENING STRAINS OF WAGNER'S
"RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES."  AS THE MUSIC BOOMS LOUDER, LIEBKIND
ADDRESSES THEM.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please to don your helmets.

FROM THE TABLE THEY TAKE CLASSIC WAGNERIAN HELMETS (WITH
HORNS) AND PLACE THEM ON THEIR HEADS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please to light your candles.

THEY EACH TAKE A HUGE WHITE CANDLE FROM THE TABLE AND LIGHT
IT.  LIEBKIND FLICKS THE LIGHT SWITCH.  NOW THEY ARE IN THE
DARK EXCEPT FOR THE GLOW OF THEIR CANDLES.

                         LIEBKIND
            Please repeat after me.  I solemnly

                   the pen)


                         LIEBKIND
            No.  No.  Not in ink.  We'll
            desecrate the oath.  It must be
            done in blood.

CUT TO BLOOM'S FACE.  IT IS A SILENT OI.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fingers, please.

                                                           43.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM EXTEND THEIR FOREFINGERS AND LOOK THE
OTHER WAY.  LIEBKIND PRICKS THEM WITH THE SACRED SAFETY PIN,
AND SQUEEZES A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD FROM EACH INTO THE SACRED
VESSEL (A JAR COVER).  HE DOES THE SAME WITH HIS OWN FINGER.

            taken from the last chicken I
            served at Berchtesgarten.

LIEBKIND SIGNS.  "THE RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES" REACHES ITS
ZENITH.  IT ECHOES THROUGH THE ROOM AS WE FADE OUT.

FADE IN ON BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY WALK UP STREET AWAY
FROM TENEMENT.  IT IS LATE AFTERNOON.  THEY ARE BOTH WEARING
SWASTIKA ARM BANDS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (triumphantly whacking
                   the contract with the
                   back of his hand)
            There it is... in red and white!
            "Springtime For Hitler," signed,
            sealed and delivered.
                   (he notices Bloom's
                   dour expression)
            What's the matter with you?

                         BLOOM
            Look, I'm just not wearing this arm
            band.  I don't care how big the
            deal is.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (placating him)
            Okay, take it off, take it off.

THEY TAKE OFF THEIR ARM BANDS AND TOSS THEM INTO A LITTER
BASKET.  BIALYSTOCK SPOTS A PASSING TAXI.  HE WHISTLES.  IT
STOPS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to cab driver as he
                   opens door)
            The Blue Gypsy.

                         BLOOM
                   (about to enter cab
                   with Bialystock)
            Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?!

                                                           44.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (stopping Bloom from
                   entering cab)
            We are not going to The Blue Gypsy.
            I am going to The Blue Gypsy.

BIALYSTOCK GETS INTO CAB AND SLAMS THE DOOR.  HE CONTINUES
SPEAKING TO BLOOM THROUGH THE WINDOW.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I have a rendez-vous with a lady of
            some means.  You see dear Bloom,
            phase one is complete, the play is
            ours.  We are now entering phase
            two -- the raising of the money.
            In the days to come, you will see
            very little of me, for Bialystock
            is launching himself into little-
            old-lady-land.
                   (to cab driver)
            Avanti!

THE CAB SPEEDS AWAY.

SWISH PAN CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LITTLE OLD LADY #3.  IN HER
HAND SHE HOLDS A BUBBLING GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.  SHE RAISES IT
TO BIALYSTOCK.

PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY.
THEY ARE SEATED IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A LITTLE VIENNESE CAFE.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            Here's to the success of your new
            play.

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS GLASS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Our play, my love.

HE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST.
IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF
THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY.  THE TOAST IS A
FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS
VEST AND TROUSERS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Think nothing of it, my dear.  A
            mere trifle.  A mere trifle.  Did
            you bring your checkbook?

                                                           45.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY #3
            It's right here in my purse and I
            made it out just as you told me --
            to cash.  That's a funny name for a
            play.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Think nothing of it.

SHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK
AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK.  AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE
ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE
CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED
BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE
PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED.
BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT
EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE
OLD LADY CLUTCH HER HEART.  BIALYSTOCK IS VERY UNHAPPY.  HE
QUIETLY BRINGS HIS FOOT FROM BENEATH THE TABLE AND PLACES IT
DIRECTLY OVER THE FOOT OF THE VIOLINIST.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S
FOOT.  BIALYSTOCK PROCEEDS TO CRUSH VIOLINIST'S FOOT.

CUT TO VIOLINIST'S FACE.  SOMEHOW IT CONVEYS TO US ALL THE
MISERY AND PAIN OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.  WITH EYES CROSSED
BY GRIEF, HE LIMPS TO ANOTHER TABLE.  BIALYSTOCK QUICKLY
REACHES OUT AND SNATCHES THE CHECK.

SWISH PAN CUT TO HANSOM CAB THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH
CENTRAL PARK.  NIGHT.

CUT TO INTERIOR OF CAB.  BIALYSTOCK IS COZILY ENSCONCED WITH
LITTLE OLD LADY #4.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (taking check from
                   old lady)
            Thank you, my dear.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #4
            Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again.
            Tell me again.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Edna, I swear on my life, you don't
            look a day over sixty-five.

SWISH PAN CUT TO CITY TRAFFIC.  DAY.  A TAXI FILLS THE
SCREEN.  AS IT MOVES OUT OF FRAME, WE DISCOVER BIALYSTOCK
AND LITTLE OLD LADY #5 ASTRIDE A RED AND WHITE HONDA MOTOR
SCOOTER.  AS THEY ROAR PAST THE CAMERA, BIALYSTOCK SHOUTS.

                                                           46.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Clear the road!  Clear the road!

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #5
                   (clutching Bialystock fiercely)
            Go, Bialy, baby, go!

SWISH PAN CUT TO POSH PARK AVENUE APARTMENT.  NIGHT.  A
PRIVATE CONCERN IS IN PROGRESS.  A THIN, CONSUMPTIVE-LOOKING
YOUNG MAN FINGERS HIS WAY THROUGH A CHOPIN NOCTURNE.

CAMERA SLOWLY PANS THE ROOM.  SEATED IN A SEMI-CIRCLE AROUND
THE PIANO ON VARIOUS PIECES OF DELICATE EMPIRE FURNITURE IS
AN AUSTERE GROUP OF ELDERLY DIGNIFIED PATRONS OF THE ARTS.
SUDDENLY AN OLD LADY'S SHRIEK RENDS THE AIR.  EVERYONE'S
HEAD TURNS.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #6
                   (slightly flustered)
            Go on with the concert!  Go on with
            the concert!  It's nothing.  Nothing.

BIALYSTOCK STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #6
                   (to Bialystock, smiling)
            You dirty man.

SWISH PAN CUT TO NEW YORK STREET.  OLD FASHIONED LIMOUSINE
PULLS INTO VIEW.  THE WINDOW SHADES ARE DRAWN.  AS IT
PASSES, WE DETECT STRANGE SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE INTERIOR.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #7
                   (off camera)
            Tee hee, ha ha ha, ho ho, ooo, ooo,
            teehee hee.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (off camera, simultaneously)
            Heh, heh, heh.  Hah, hah, hah.

THE CAR DRIVES OUT OF FRAME.

SWISH PAN CUT TO SCULPTOR'S ATELIER.  DAY.  AN ANCIENT
LITTLE OLD LADY WEARING A SCULPTOR'S SMOCK IS FEEBLY CHIPPING
AWAY WITH CHISEL AND HAMMER AT A HUGE SQUARE BLOCK OF MARBLE.
SHE MAKES NOT A SCRATCH ON IT.

CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, HER SUBJECT,
STANDING NUDE, EXCEPT FOR LOIN CLOTH, HOLDING UP AN ENORMOUS
GLOBE.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY ATLAS.

                                                           47.


                         LITTLE OLD LADY #8
                   (stepping back to
                   admire her work)
            Well, Bialy, how's it coming?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            It's beautiful, Alma, beautiful.
                   (to the heavens)
            Oi.

SWISH PAN CUT TO LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.  BIALYSTOCK, DRESSED
AS A TURKISH SLAVE, IS ASLEEP ON THE SOFA.  THE ROOM HAS
BEEN DONE IN A BYZANTINE DECOR.  THE STRAINS OF SCHEHERAZADE
SOFTLY FILL THE ROOM.  SUDDENLY A WHIP COMES FLASHING INTO
THE FRAME AND WHACKS AGAINST THE TORSO OF THE SLEEPING
BIALYSTOCK.

SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL 'HOLD ME, TOUCH ME' WIELDING THE WHIP.
SHE IS DRESSED IN AN 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' COSTUME.

                         HOLD ME, TOUCH ME
            Dance!  Dance, slave!

BIALYSTOCK IS UP IN A FLASH AND INTO A QUICK TURKISH TIME
STEP SO AS TO AVOID THE DEADLY LASH.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            How's this?

                         HOLD ME, TOUCH ME
            Faster, faster, you dog.  Excite
            me, delight me.  Hold me, touch me.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FACE AS HE DANCES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (murmuring to himself)
            Money is honey, money is honey.

DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.  NIGHT.  BIALYSTOCK IS
SEATED AT THE DESK.  ON ONE SIDE OF HIM IS A LARGE STACK OF
SIGNED INVESTOR CONTRACTS.  ON THE OTHER AN EQUALLY LARGE
PILE OF UNSIGNED ONES.  BIALYSTOCK SIGNS FURIOUSLY, AS BLOOM
FEEDS THE CONTRACTS TO HIM.

                         BLOOM
                   (handing Bialystock contract)
            Mrs. Sarah Catheart.  She owns 50%
            of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK DUTIFULLY SIGNS.  BLOOM TAKES ANOTHER AND PLACES
IT BEFORE BIALYSTOCK.

                                                           48.


                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also
            owns 50% of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  BLOOM PUTS THE NEXT ONE DOWN.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also
            owns 50% of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  BLOOM TAKES ANOTHER.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100%
            of the profits.

BIALYSTOCK SIGNS.  THEN LOOKS UP AT BLOOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Leo, what if this play is a hit?

                         BLOOM
            Then the Department of Justice owns
            100% of Bialystock and Bloom.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (Bloom's thought
                   makes him unhappy)
            OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a
            favor.  Open the safe.  I want to
            see the money.

LEO, HUMORING HIM, SPINS THE COMBINATION DIAL ON SAFE AND
OPENS IT.

CUT TO INSIDE OF SAFE.  IT IS JAMMED FULL OF NEATLY STACKED
PILES OF MONEY.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES IN FRONT OF SAFE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to himself.  Inhales deeply)
            That's better.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES OUT A STACK OF NEATLY FOLDED BILLS.  HE
SMELLS IT, KISSES IT AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET.

                         BLOOM
            What are you doing?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked
            very, very hard and I think I
            deserve a toy.

                                                           49.


                         BLOOM
                   (quizzically)
            A toy?

DISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP, FACE OF A GORGEOUS BLONDE, ULLA.
DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF HER.  SHE IS INCREDIBLY
WELL-ENDOWED.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEIR EYES GLUED TO HER FORM.

                         BLOOM
            That's a toy?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Yes.  She's an adult, educational
            toy made in Sweden for children
            over fifty.

BLOOM STARES AT HIM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Stop looking at me like that.
            She's not an indulgence.  She
            happens to be our new receptionist.
            She goes with our new surroundings.

QUICKLY PAN POSH NEW WALL-PAPER, FURNISHINGS, ETC.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Ulla, I'd like you to meet my
            partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.

                         ULLA
            Got dag pa dig.

                         BLOOM
            How do you do.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Have you gone mad?  A receptionist
            that can't speak English.  What
            will people say?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah,
            ooh, ooh."

                         BLOOM
            What is she gonna do here?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.

                         ULLA
            Ya, sur.

                                                           50.


ULLA GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND PLACES NEEDLE ON RECORD.  THE
DRIVING SOUND OF A TWIST FILLS THE ROOM.  ULLA SENSUOUSLY
TWISTS, VIBRATES, FRUGS, WATUSIS AND ROCKS HER BODY IN TIME
WITH MUSIC.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            See, it helps the day go by.  Ulla,
            okay.  Okay.

ULLA STOPS, GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND TAKES NEEDLE OFF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Go to desk.  Answer telephone.

HE PICKS UP PHONE TO SHOW HER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bialystock and Bloom.  Bialystock
            and Bloom.

                         ULLA
                   (repeating to herself
                   as she leaves)
            Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock
            and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.
            Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom, opening up
                   a box on his desk)
            Hey, Blum, have a cigar.

                         BLOOM
            No thanks.

BIALYSTOCK TAKES AN ENORMOUS BLACK CIGAR.

                         BLOOM
            Max, maybe...

BIALYSTOCK REACHES UNDER HIS DESK.  PRESSES BUZZER.  WE HEAR
BUZZING SOUND IN ANTE-ROOM.

                         BLOOM
            What's that?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nothing.  Nothing.  Go on.

ULLA ENTERS.  GOES TO DESK, PICKS UP CIGARETTE LIGHTER,
LIGHTS BIALYSTOCK'S CIGAR, KISSES HIM.

                                                           51.


                         ULLA
                   (pinching Bialystock's
                   cheek)
            Min Bialystock.

ULLA LEAVES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Nice girl.

                         BLOOM
            Max, as I was saying, maybe we
            should go easy on the spending.  I
            mean these offices and everything.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why?  Take it when you can get it!
            Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!

                         BLOOM
            But if something should... God
            forbid... go wrong, at least we
            could give them some of their money
            back.  It would look better in court.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Stop talking like that, you white
            mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong.
            As a matter of fact, today I have
            taken steps to insure total disaster.
            At two o'clock we have an
            appointment with none other than
            Roger De Bris.

                         BLOOM
                   (searching)
            Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh
            yes, the director.  Is he good... I
            mean bad?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Roger De Bris is the worst director
            that ever lived.

                         BLOOM
            Do you think he'll take the job?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Only if we ask him.

BIALYSTOCK CONSULTS HIS WATCH.

                                                           52.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're
            late.

BIALYSTOCK BUZZES.  ULLA ENTERS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Call chauffeur.  Get car.

                         ULLA
                   (smiling)
            Good.  Good.  We go Motel.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No.  We go.
                   (he indicates Bloom
                   and himself)


                         ULLA
            You, Blum go Motel.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.

                         ULLA
                   (as she leaves)
            Get car.  Get car.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Very nice girl.

DISSOLVE TO STREET IN FRONT OF CHIC TOWNHOUSE UPPER SIXTIES.
DAY.  A WHITE ROLLS ROYCE LIMO PULLS UP.  A LIVERIED
CHAUFFEUR WITH SMALL LATIN-TYPE MUSTACHE GETS OUT AND OPENS
DOOR FOR PASSENGERS.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM GET OUT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to chauffeur)
            Thank you, Rudolfo.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CLIMB THE STEPS TO THE FRONT DOOR.
BIALYSTOCK PUSHES THE DOORBELL.  WE HEAR CHIMES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whispering)
            Now don't let anything he does or
            says upset you.  He's a little
            peculiar.

                         BLOOM
            What do you mean?

                                                           53.


THE DOOR OPENS.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS A THIN, STRANGE
LOOKING MAN IN A BLACK TURTLENECK SWEATER.  (CARMEN GIYA)
HE CONTEMPLATES THEM COLDLY.

                         CARMEN
            Yesssssss?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I am Max Bialystock.  This is my
            associate, Mr. Bloom.  We have an
            appointment with Mr. De Bris.

                         CARMEN
            Ah, yes, you're expected.  Please
            come in.

THEY ENTER THE VESTIBULE.  CARMEN CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND THEM.

                         CARMEN
            How do you do.  I'm Carmen Giya, Mr.
            De Bris' private secretary.  Would
            you be so kind as to remove your
            shoes.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER BEWILDERED.

                         CARMEN
            White, white, white is the color of
            our carpets.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM REMOVE THEIR SHOES.

                         CARMEN
                   (to Bloom indicating
                   a rack of slippers)
            Now, let's see, you're wearing grey.
            I would suggest the crimson.
            They're a little vivid, but your
            suit is so quiet.
                   (to Bialystock,
                   studying his mish
                   mash attire)
            Why don't you... Oh, take anything.
            Please follow me.

CARMEN LEADS THE WAY.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCUFF AFTER HIM.
WE FOLLOW THEM DOWN A NARROW CORRIDOR LINED WITH EXAMPLES OF
CLASSIC GREEK SCULPTURE -- EACH ONE DEPICTING NUDE MALES IN
VARIOUS POSES.

INT: ELEVATOR.

CUT TO ROGER DE BRIS' BOUDOIR SITTING ROOM.  IT IS ELEGANTLY
FEMININE.

                                                           54.


CHAISE LOUNGE, ANTIQUE MIRRORS, LOUIS XVI ARMOIRE AND
DRESSING TABLE.  FROM BEHIND AN ORNATE DRESSING SCREEN, WE
HEAR MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISCONTENT.

                         DE BRIS
                   (from behind screen)
            I'll never get into this damned
            thing.

CUT TO BOUDOIR ENTRANCE.  CARMEN, BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER.

                         CARMEN
                   (to De Bris)
            We're not alone.

DE BRIS' HEAD POPS OVER THE SCREEN.  HE IS A ONCE HANDSOME,
NOW DISSIPATED MAN IN HIS LATE FORTIES.

                         DE BRIS
            Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I
            presume.  Ha, ha, ha, forgive the
            pun.

                         BLOOM
                   (to Bialystock)
            What pun?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (a curt whisper)
            Shut up.  He thinks he's witty.
                   (to De Bris)
            It's good to see you again, Roger.
            Did you get a chance to read
            "Springtime For Hitler?"

DE BRIS EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN.  HE IS WEARING A
"LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN" STYLE DRESS.

                         DE BRIS
            Remarkable.  Remarkable.  A stunning
            piece of work.

                         BLOOM
                   (shocked, whispers)
            Max!  He's wearing a dress.
                   (his mouth remains open)


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Shhhhhh.

                                                           55.


                         DE BRIS
                   (continuing)
            I think it's a very important play.
            I, for one, never realized that the
            Third Reich meant Germany.  I mean
            it's drenched with historical
            goodies like that.

DE BRIS IS SUDDENLY AWARE OF BLOOM'S EXPRESSION.  (BLOOM'S
MOUTH IS STILL AGAPE.)

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, dear, you're staring at my
            dress.  I should explain.  I'm
            going to the Choreographer's Ball
            tonight.  There's a prize for the
            best costume.

                         CARMEN
                   (smugly)
            We always win.

                         DE BRIS
                   (looking in the mirror)
            I'm not so sure about tonight.  I'm
            supposed to be the Grand Duchess --
            I think I look more like Tugboat
            Annie.  What do you think?

HE PARADES BACK AND FORTH, EXECUTING SHARP TURNS LIKE A
MODEL AT A FASHION SHOW.

                         DE BRIS
            No be cruel.  Be brutal.  Be brutal.
            Because heaven knows they will.
            Well, what do you think, Mr. Bloom?

                         BLOOM
                   (very embarrassed)
            Well, it's... uh... it's nice and
            long... I mean, it's... uh... uh...
            where do you keep your wallet?

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (jumping in)
            It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous.
            You couldn't have picked a better
            color.  It brings out your eyes.
            Let's face it, Roger, that dress is
            you.

                                                           56.


                         DE BRIS
                   (his eyes flashing flirtatiously)
            Do you really think it brings out
            my eyes?

                         CARMEN
                   (irritated)
            We can't tell a thing without your
            wig.  As far as I'm concerned,
            you're only half-dressed.

                         DE BRIS
            Ummmm.  Well, if you're so worried
            about the wig, get it, o' wicked
            witch of the west.

CARMEN TURNS IN A HUFF AND LEAVES TO GET THE WIG.  DE BRIS
REACHES INTO CUT CRYSTAL CIGARETTE BOX, TAKES CIGARETTE,
TAPS IT, AND HOLDS IT FOR A LIGHT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a whisper to Bloom)
            Quick, light his cigarette.  He
            likes you.

BLOOM NERVOUSLY REACHES FOR A BOOK OF MATCHES, RIPS ONE OUT
AND STRIKES IT.  IT DOESN'T LIGHT.  HE TRIES ANOTHER AND
ANOTHER.  ONE FINALLY CATCHES FIRE.  HE TRIES TO HOLD IT
STEADY, BUT HE IS TOO NERVOUS.  DE BRIS FIRMLY PLACES HIS
HAND OVER BLOOM'S TO STEADY THE FLAME.

                         DE BRIS
            Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?

HE LIGHTS THE CIGARETTE BUT CONTINUES TO HOLD BLOOM'S HAND.

                         BLOOM
            I've... I've... never been on a
            cruise.

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, quel dommage.

CARMEN ENTERS CARRYING WIG.  HE SEES DE BRIS HOLDING BLOOM'S
HAND.

                         CARMEN
                   (snidely)
            Oh, I see we're getting acquainted.

DE BRIS DROPS BLOOM'S HAND AND TURNS ON CARMEN.

                                                           57.


                         DE BRIS
            How would you like to go back to
            teasing hair, big mouth?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Roger, do you mind if we talk a
            little business?

                         DE BRIS
            Please, please, that's what we're
            here for.
                   (to Carmen, who is
                   adjusting the wig)
            Be careful, that hurt.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I think this would be a marvelous
            opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to
            now, you've always been associated
            with musicals, and...

                         DE BRIS
            Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey
            gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-
            turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to
            make you throw up!  At last a
            chance to do straight drama!  To
            deal with conflict, with inner
            truth.  Roger De Bris presents
            history.  Of course, I think we
            should add a little music.  That
            whole third act has got to go.
            They're losing the war.  It's too
            depressing.  We'll have to put
            something in there.
                   (gripped by his vision)
            Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of
            beautiful girls, dressed as Storm
            Troopers, black patent leather
            boots, all marching together...
            Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn-
            kick-turn!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            That's genius.  That's genius.
            Roger, I think I speak for Mr.
            Bloom and myself when I say that
            you're the only man in the world
            who can do justice to SPRINGTIME
            FOR HITLER.

                                                           58.


                         DE BRIS
                   (in one rush)
            Wait a minute.  This is a very big
            decision.  It might effect the
            course of my entire life.  I'll
            have to think about it.  I'll do it.

DE BRIS EXTENDS HIS HAND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES IT.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations.

                         DE BRIS
                   (to Carmen)
            Get on the phone.  Send out a
            casting call.  Call every agent in
            town.  I want to see everybody.
            Everybody.

DISSOLVE TO STAGE DOOR OF BROADWAY THEATRE.  DAY.  SIGN ON
DOOR READS:  CASTING TODAY -- SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.

QUICK DISSOLVE TO INTERIOR OF THEATRE.  THE PLACE IS A
MADHOUSE.  HUNDREDS OF WOULD-BE HITLERS FILL THE STAGE.
EACH AND EVERY ONE WITH THE FUHRER'S HAIRCUT AND LITTLE
SQUARE MUSTACHE.  THERE ARE TALL HITLERS, SHORT HITLERS, FAT
HITLERS, SKINNY HITLERS, METHOD HITLERS, SHAKESPEAREAN
HITLERS, ALL KINDS HITLERS.

CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE.  SEATED THERE, WATCHING THE
BEDLAM, ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, DE BRIS, CARMEN GIYA AND
FRANZ LIEBKIND.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (looking for the
                   least likely Hitler)
            Roger, what about that one?  The
            fat Hitler on the right?

                         DE BRIS
            I don't know.  I rather fancy that
            one.

CUT TO BEAUTIFUL, BLOND, MUSCULAR, YOUNG MAN, WHO LOOKS AS
IF HE IS POSING FOR "BODY BEAUTIFUL." HE BEARS NOT THE
SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO HITLER EVEN THOUGH HE DOES SPORT A
LITTLE BLACK MUSTACHE.

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Not bad.  Not bad.  What do you
            think, Franz?

                                                           59.


                         LIEBKIND
                   (very emotional)
            I don't know.  I don't know.  For
            some strange reason, I'm deeply
            moved.
                   (he wipes away a tear)


                         DE BRIS
                   (getting to his feet)
            Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam.  We
            must have some order.

DE BRIS, FOLLOWED BY CARMEN, HOPS TO THE STAGE AND ADDRESSES
THE MILLING MOB.

                         DE BRIS
                   (clapping his hands
                   for attention)
            Will all the dancing Hitlers please
            wait in the wings.  We're only
            taking the singing Hitlers.

AS THE DANCING HITLERS LEAVE THE STAGE, CARMEN ARRANGES THE
SINGING HITLERS SO THAT THEY ARE IN A LONG STRAIGHT LINE
AGAINST THE BACK OF THE STAGE WALL.  CARMEN READS OUT A NAME
AND THE FIRST SINGING HITLER WALKS DOWNSTAGE TO AUDITION.
EXCEPT FOR A SPORTY LITTLE HITLER MUSTACHE, HE BEARS LITTLE
RESEMBLANCE TO THE FUHRER.

                         CARMEN
            Arthur Packard.

                         DE BRIS
            Hello, Arthur.  Tell us something
            about yourself.

                         ARTHUR PACKARD
                   (in a strangulated
                   tenor's voice)
            I was the lead tenor of the
            Albuquerque Opera Company for two
            seasons.  I just finished a road
            tour of STUDENT PRINCE.  And last
            season I was up for the lead in the
            Broadway production of Circus Man.

                         DE BRIS
            What happened?

                         ARTHUR PACKARD
            I didn't get it.

                                                           60.


                         DE BRIS
            What are you going to sing for us
            Arthur?

AS ARTHUR TELLS HIM THE TITLE OF HIS SONG, DE BRIS MOUTHS IT
WORD FOR WORD TOWARD HIS FRIEND, CARMEN.

                   (sings)
            My boy Bill will be strong and as
            tall as a...

                         DE BRIS
            Thank you.

                         CARMEN
            Jason Green.

JASON GREEN COMES DOWNSTAGE.  HE IS A BIG, BARREL-CHESTED
MAN.  HE ALSO WEARS HITLER-TYPE MUSTACHE.

                         DE BRIS
            Well, Jason, what have you been
            doing lately?

                         JASON GREEN
                   (in basso profundo)
            For the last sixteen years, I've
            been touring with "Naughty Marietta."

                         DE BRIS
            Good.  And what are you going to
            sing for us, Jason?

AS JASON TELLS HIM THE SONG'S TITLE, DE BRIS ONCE AGAIN
MOUTHS IT WORD FOR WORD WITH HIM.

            "Stout-hearted Men."

            Who are stout-hearted men
            Who will fight for the right they
            adore."

                         DE BRIS

            Who are stout-hearted men
            And I'll soon show you ten thousand
            more."

                         DE BRIS
                   (off-camera voice)
            Thaaank you.

DISSOLVE TO ANOTHER HITLER (ITALIAN BASSO)

                         ITALIAN HITLER

            "Shoulder to shoulder and bolder
            and bolder
            They grow as they march to the war."

                         DE BRIS
                   (voice off camera)
            Thaaank you.

DISSOLVE TO DELICATE HITLER

                         DELICATE HITLER
                   (singing)
            "There is nothing in this world can
            halt or mar our plan."

                         DE BRIS

                                                           62.


                         DE BRIS
                   (voice off camera)
            Thaaank you.

CUT TO CARMEN GIYA ON STAGE.  IT IS NOW EMPTY.

                         CARMEN
            Well, that's it.

CUT TO FIRST ROW OF AUDIENCE.  SLOW PAN BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM,
DE BRIS, AD LIEBKIND.  THEY ARE TIRED, DISHEVELED AND UNHAPPY.

                         BLOOM
            I think that's enough Hitlers for
            one day.  Maybe we'll get lucky
            tomorrow.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You think out of all those Hitlers
            you could find just one...

                         LIEBKIND
            It was the same thing in Germany.
            We looked for years before we found
            the right Hitler.

FROM OFF-STAGE WE HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF BOOTS APPROACHING.
ALL EYES TURN TOWARD THE STAGE.  FROM OUT OF THE WINGS STEPS

A YOUNG PERSON IN A LEATHER DOUBLET, HIGH LEATHER BOOTS, AND
EXTREMELY LONG HAIR.  IT CARRIES A GUITAR.  UNTIL IT SPEAKS,
WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG WOMAN.
(LORENZO ST. DU BOIS)

                         LSD
            Hey, man.

                         CARMEN
            I beg your pardon.

                         LSD
            Is this where they're auditioning
            Boomerang?

                         CARMEN
                   (studying him coldly)
            No, I'm afraid you've wandered into
            the wrong theatre.

                         LSD
                   (to himself, as he
                   starts to leave)
            Man, freaked out again.

                                                           63.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (leaping to his feet)
            Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is
            Boomerang.

                         DE BRIS
                   (to Bialystock)
            What are you saying?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Let's hear him.  What have we got
            to lose?
                   (to LSD)
            What's your name?

                         LSD
            Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody
            calls me LSD.

                         DE BRIS
            What have you done, LSD?

                         LSD
            Six months, I'm out on probation,
            but it's cool now, baby.

                         DE BRIS
            I mean in show business.

                         LSD
            Oh, in show business.  Well, let's
            put it this way, my next job will
            be my debut.

                         DE BRIS
            What do you do best?

                         LSD
            Hey, man, I can't do that here,
            that's what they put me away for.

                         DE BRIS
            Oh, sing.  Sing!

                         LSD
            Hey, baby, that's where they put
            me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know
            that, you been up?

                         DE BRIS
                   (a little hysterical)
            Sing a song!  Just sing a song!

                                                           64.


                         LSD
            Here's a little thing I think
            you're going to see on the charts
            any day.  I wrote it last night in
            my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk
            Rock Ballad.

LSD SINGS "I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT." THE
SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT "RAGA ROCK" BEAT.  PHRASES
SUCH AS, "CONNECT WITH THE INFINITE" AND "TURN ON THE
WORLD." LORENZO FINISHES THE NUMBER.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM, LIEBKIND AND DE BRIS.  THEY ARE
STUNNED.  BIALYSTOCK IS THE FIRST TO RECOVER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (shouting)
            That's our Hitler!

                         LIEBKIND
                   (howls of despair)
            Vaaaat???

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (quickly)
            Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a
            man of his time.  This is a man of
            his time.

                         LIEBKIND
            But he has long hair!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Don't look at the outside, look at
            the inside.  It's the inner Hitler
            we're after.  The young beautiful
            Hitler, who danced his way to glory.

                         LIEBKIND
            I don't know.  I don't know.

                         DE BRIS
                   (he has been studying
                   LSD intensely)
            Could be an exciting piece of off-
            beat casting.  Of course, we'd have
            to do something about that coiffure.

                         LIEBKIND
            But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy,
            he's so... so... American!

                                                           65.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't
            let you down.

                         LIEBKIND
            All right, but remember, if you
            damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I
            kill you.

DISSOLVE TO MARQUEE OF BROADWAY THEATRE.  MARQUEE READS:
OPENING TONIGHT - SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.  Directed by ROGER
DE BRIS.

PAN DOWN TO THEATRE ENTRANCE.  THE SIDEWALK IS CHOKED WITH
OPENING NIGHTERS, ALL AGLITTER IN DIAMONDS, FURS AND ELEGANT
TUXEDOS.  LUXURIOUS BLACK LIMOUSINES PULL UP TO THE CURB,
DEPOSITING THEIR RICH CONTENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE
LITTLE OLD LADIES.

CUT TO LOBBY.  THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SWIRLING CONFUSION
STAND BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IN THEIR OPENING NIGHT TAILS.
BIALYSTOCK IS RESPLENDENT IN A BLACK SILK CAPE, LINED IN
CRIMSON SATIN.  BLOOM'S TAILS ARE OBVIOUSLY RENTED.  THEY
ARE NEAR THE TICKET TAKER.  AS SOME OF THE OPENING NIGHT
"SUPPORTERS" ENTER THE THEATRE, THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENTS TO
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  TO EACH OF THE WELL-WISHERS,
BIALYSTOCK RESPONDS WITH A SMILE AND A MUMBLE.  THEY GET THE
SMILE, WE HEAR THE MUMBLE.

                         FIRST WELL-WISHER
                   (a silver-haired
                   gentleman in his late fifties)
            Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big
            hit.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (mumbling)
            Bite your tongue.

                         SECOND WELL-WISHER
                   (a little old lady)
            We're gonna do it this time, Bialy,
            I just know it.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I hope you lose your bloomers.

                         THIRD WELL-WISHER
                   (another old lady)
            My prayers go with you, Bialy.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            God Forbid.

                                                           66.


CUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE.  DOORMAN
OPENS DOOR, ASSISTS RICH COUPLE OUT OF CAR.  LIMOUSINE PULLS
AWAY.  A MOTORCYCLE WITH SIDE-CAR ROARS UP TO FRONT OF
THEATRE.  AT THE HANDLEBARS, BEAUTIFULLY DECKED OUT IN
TUXEDO AND HIS EVER POPULAR GERMAN HELMET IS FRANZ LIEBKIND.

CAMERA FOLLOWS LIEBKIND AS HE ENTERS LOBBY.  HE MAKES HIS
WAY THROUGH THE MILLING THRONG TOWARD BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bialystock and
                   Bloom, very seriously)
            Gentlemen, this is a very momentous
            moment.

HE CLICKS HIS HEELS AND SHAKES HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bloom)
            Good luck.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Good luck.

HE STARTS INTO THEATRE, STOPS, TURNS BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND
BLOOM.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (a mad gleam in his eye)
            Tonight, New York.  Tomorrow, the
            world!

HE TURNS TRIUMPHANTLY AND ENTERS THE THEATRE.

                         OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)
            Check your hat?

                         LIEBKIND
                   (off camera)
            No!!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            So much for Nutsy Fagin.

                         BLOOM
                   (nudging Bialystock, whispers)
            Here comes the Times Drama Critic.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Watch closely, as Bialystock drives
            the last nail into the coffin.

BIALYSTOCK AMBLES OVER TO THE TIMES CRITIC, WHO HAS STOPPED
TO CHAT WITH SOME PEOPLE.

                                                           67.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            Always delighted to see the
            gentlemen of the press.  There you
            are, sir.  Two on the aisle,
            compliments of the management.
                   (he smiles unctuously)


                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (haughtily accepting tickets)
            Thank you.  Here, wait a minute.
            There seems to be some mistake.
            There's a hundred dollar bill
            wrapped around these tickets.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (conspiratorially)
            It's no mistake.  Enjoy the show.

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (outraged)
            Mr. Bialystock, just what do you
            think you're doing?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I'm bribing you.  And if you play
            ball, there's a lot more where that
            came from.

BIALYSTOCK WINKS AND SAUNTERS OFF.

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (blustering with rage)
            I... I... I... How dare he!  I've
            never been so insulted in my life!
            The gall of the man!  The incredible
            gall of the man!  I'll fix his wagon.

THE CRITIC STALKS INTO THE THEATRE.  AS HE PASSES BIALYSTOCK,
HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY FLINGS THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL TO THE
FLOOR.  HE DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR.

                         OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL)
            Check your hat?

                         DRAMA CRITIC
                   (off camera)
            No!!

BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN, PICKS UP CRUMPLED DOLLAR BILL,
STRAIGHTENS IT OUT, PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET.

                                                           68.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (grinning like a
                   Cheshire cat)
            Heh, heh, heh.  He'll kill us.

FROM INSIDE THE THEATRE, WE HEAR THE OVERTURE BEGINNING.
LIGHTS IN THE LOBBY BLINK.

                         BLOOM
            Come on, they've started the
            overture.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE THEATRE.

CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING DARKENED
THEATRE.  THEY TAKE POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.
BLOOM EXTENDS HIS HAND TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE INTENDS TO SPEAK
IN A CONFIDENT AND CONTROLLED MANNER BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS
AN HYSTERICAL SHRIEK.

                         BLOOM
                   (casually shrieking)
            Well, Max, this is it!!!

HE SCARES HIMSELF AND QUICKLY CLAPS HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH.

                         BLOOM
                   (whispers)
            I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Relax, in two hours our worries
            will be over.

CUT TO STAGE.  AS THE OVERTURE IS CONCLUDED, THE CURTAIN
SLOWLY RISES.  ON STAGE THERE IS A LINE OF GIRLS DRESSED IN
SEXY STORM TROOPER COSTUMES--BLACK PATENT LEATHER BOOTS, ETC.
THEIR ARMS ARE LINKED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY DANCE AND
KICK IN RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL ROCKETTE FASHION.

                         STORM TROOPER CHORUS
                   (singing)
            Germany was having trouble,
            What a sad, sad story.
            Needed a new leader
            To restore its former glory.
            Where, oh, where was he,
            Who could that man be,
            We looked around,
            And then we found,
            The man for you and me,
            And now its...

                                                           69.


THE STORM TROOPER ROCKETTES PART AND FROM ABOVE THEM,
DESCENDING TWIN STAIRCASES, WE SEE TWO LINES OF BEAUTIFUL
SHOWGIRLS, HOLDING HUGE BALLOONS ABOVE THEIR HEADS.  ON EACH
BALLOON IS PAINTED A PICTURE OF THE FUHRER.  EVERYONE SINGS
AS THEY DESCEND.

                         ENTIRE CHORUS
                   (singing)
            "Springtime for Hitler," etc.

CUT TO AUDIENCE.  NUMBER ON STAGE CONTINUES.

CLOSE-UP OF MAN AND WOMAN ON AISLE.

                         WOMAN (DOWAGER)
            This is shocking!

CUT TO ANOTHER AREA OF AUDIENCE.  ANOTHER COUPLE.

                         MAN (STUFFED SHIRT)
            Outrageous!

CUT TO CRITIC ON THE AISLE, BIALYSTOCK'S P.O.V.  HE SCOWLS
AS HE FURIOUSLY MAKES NOTES.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AT BACK OF THEATRE.  THEY ARE
SMILING.  BIALYSTOCK POINTS TO COUPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR
SEATS AND STARTED UP THE AISLE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Ahhhhh, it's going better than I
            expected.

THE COUPLE COMES ABREAST OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

                         WOMAN
                   (to man as they exit theatre)
            Well, talk about bad taste.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (he chuckles as they leave)
            Come, let us repair to the bar
            across the street.  I don't want to
            be caught here during intermission.
            We'll be stoned to death.

THEY LINK ARMS AND MERRILY MARCH OUT OF THE THEATRE.

CUT TO STAGE.  "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER" OPENING IS ENDING IN
A GREAT CRESCENDO OF PATRIOTIC INSANITY.

                                                           70.


                         ENTIRE CHORUS
                   (singing)
            So Springtime for Hitler,
            Is Springtime for Goering,
            Is Springtime for Goebbels,
            Is Springtime for Himmler,
            Is Springtime for you and me!!

CURTAIN FALLS.  THE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE AUDIENCE WITH
HUSHED SILENCE.  FOLLOWED BY A SURGE TOWARD THE DOORS.  THE
AISLES ARE CHOKED WITH UNHAPPY PEOPLE, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET
OUT.

CURTAIN RISES.  ON STAGE ARE EVA BRAUN AND HITLER (LSD).
EVA BRAUN IS A FETCHING BLONDE IN LONG BRAIDS.  LSD IS
PACING UP AND DOWN.  EVA BRAUN SITS ON LOVE SEAT DOWNSTAGE.
IN HER HAND IS AN OVERSIZED DAISY.  AS SHE PULLS THE PETALS
FROM IT, SHE WHINES.  SHE HAS A PRONOUNCED AMERICAN ACCENT.

                         EVA
            Er liebt mir.  Er liebt mir nicht.
            Er liebt mir.
                   (the last petal)
            Er liebt mir nicht.

CUT TO PEOPLE IN AISLE.  THEY HAVE NOTICEABLY SLOWED DOWN.
SOME ARE WALKING BACKWARDS.  THEY ARE INTRIGUED.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

                         EVA
                   (turns to LSD)
            Du liebt mir nicht!

                         LSD
                   (protesting vehemently)
            I lieb you baby, I lieb you.  You
            know that.

                         EVA
            If you lieb me, why are you leaving
            me?

                         LSD
            Hey, man, I can't spend all my time
            with you.  I took an oath, baby,
            Deutschland uber alles.

CUT TO AUDIENCE IN AISLES.  THEY HAVE ALL STOPPED LEAVING TO
TURN AND WATCH.  SOME BEGIN TO LAUGH AND OTHERS APPLAUD.
THEY LIKE LSD.

                                                           71.


                         MAN
            That's Hitler?  I get it!  It's a
            put-on.

CUT TO WOMAN.

                         WOMAN
            Hey, Harry, he's funny.

NOW THERE IS A MAD RUSH TO REGAIN THEIR SEATS.

CUT TO INTERIOR BAR.  IT IS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE BARTENDER
AND A DRUNK AT THE FAR END OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ARE SEATED ON STOOLS AT THE BAR.  THEY CLINK GLASSES.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Here's to the one and only
            performance of "Springtime for
            Hitler."

THEY BOTH LAUGH AND DOWN THEIR DRINKS.  BIALYSTOCK RAPS ON
THE BAR WITH HIS CANE.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Innkeeper, innkeeper, another round
            of drinks here.  As a matter of
            fact, a round of drinks for
            everybody in the place!

BARTENDER LOOKS AROUND AT THE ALMOST EMPTY BARROOM.  DOES A
LITTLE TAKE.  HE THEN REPLENISHES THEIR DRINKS AND PLACES A
GLASS IN FRONT OF THE DRUNK.  THE DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT
GRACIOUSLY TOWARDS BIALYSTOCK.

                         BLOOM
            Just think, yesterday I was a
            meaningless little accountant --
            and today, I am the producer of a
            Broadway flop!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (raising his glass)
            To failure!

                         BLOOM
            To failure!

                         DRUNK
                   (blushing)
            Oh, thank you!  It's very kind of
            you.
                   (raises his glass and
                   downs his drink)
                         (MORE)

                                                           72.


                         DRUNK (CONT'D)


CUT BACK TO STAGE.  SAME SCENE.  EVA STARTS TO CRY.

                         EVA
            If the Duke of Windsor could give
            up the Throne of England for the
            woman he loved, why can't you?

                         LSD
            It's different.  I'm a tyrant, baby.

AUDIENCE LAUGHS.

CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND SEATED IN AN AISLE SEAT.  HE NERVOUSLY
PINCHES HIS FACE AS HE SEMI-COHERENTLY MUMBLES TO HIMSELF.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (becoming slightly unhinged)
            Baby, why does he keep saying baby?
            I didn't write baby.  The Fuhrer
            never said baby.  Vat is it vit
            this baby?

                         WOMAN IN ADJOINING SEAT
                   (very annoyed)
            Will you shut up!

                         LIEBKIND
            You shut up!  I'm the author.
            You're just the audience.  I
            outrank you.

CUT TO BAR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE A LITTLE TIPSY.  BY
NOW THE DRUNK HAS JOINED THEM AND ALL THREE ARE GOOD PALS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bartender, bartender, another drink
            for myself and my associate, Mr.
            Bloom.  And don't forget our good-
            natured inebriate over there.

DRUNK TIPS HIS HAT GRACIOUSLY.

                         DRUNK
            Eternally grateful.  Sincerely
            yours, Oliver Wendell Drunk.

DURING DRUNK'S SPEECH, BARTENDER HAS REFILLED THEIR GLASSES.
HE STANDS BACK, WATCHING THEM AS HE DRIES GLASSES.

                                                           73.


                         DRUNK
                   (raises his glass)
            A toast!

                         BLOOM
            To what?

                         DRUNK
                   (stumped)
            To... toast!  I love toast.

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
            To toast.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (smacking his glass
                   down on the bar)
            Now I'll take the lead and I want
            you right behind me all the way!
            One... two... three!
                   (singing)
            "By the light,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
                   (singing)
            "By the light, by the light,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Of the silvery moon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "Of the silvery mooooon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "I want to croon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "He wants to croon, he wants to
            croon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "To my honey I'll croon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "He's gonna croon love's tune,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Honeymoon,

                         BLOOM AND DRUNK
            "Honeymoon, honeymoon,

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Keep a shining in...

                                                           74.


BIALYSTOCK STOPS ABRUPTLY.  HE POINTS TOWARD THE DOOR.  WE
HEAR THE SOUND OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE BAR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Intermission!  Quick, hide your
            face.  They'll tear us to pieces.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM HOP ON THEIR STOOLS AND COVER THEIR
FACES WITH THEIR HANDS.  THE DRUNK SHRUGS, HOPS ON THE STOOL
NEXT TO THEM AND ALSO HIDES HIS FACE.  A HORDE OF FIRST
NIGHTERS SWEEPS INTO THE BAR.  THEY ARE ALL AROUND
BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND THE DRUNK, CLAMORING FOR DRINKS.

                         CROWD
                   (ad-lib)
            "Scotch on the rocks,"
            "Bourbon and soda."
            "Two martinis."
            "Whiskey sour."

THE CROWD IS VERY CHEERFUL.  THEY ARE STILL BUBBLING FROM
THE FIRST ACT.

                         WOMAN
                   (to her escort)
            Well, so far that's about the
            funniest thing I've ever seen on
            Broadway.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

                         WOMAN'S ESCORT
            Never laughed so much in my life.

                         MAN
                   (to his friend)
            Hysterical, absolutely hysterical.

                         MAN'S FRIEND
            I thought I'd split my sides.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Take it easy, don't panic.  There
            are a lot of plays on this street.
            They are not necessarily talking
            about "Springtime For Hitler."

                         HUSBAND
                   (to his wife)
            Honey, I never in a million years
            thought I'd ever love a show called
            "Springtime For Hitler."

                                                           75.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM FREEZE.  A LITTLE OLD LADY COMES UP
BEHIND BIALYSTOCK.  SHE RAPS HIM ON THE BACK WITH HER
UMBRELLA.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY #8
            Bialy, you sly fox, you've done it.
            It's a smasheroo.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (in a daze)
            Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.

THE CROWD STARTS TO LEAVE.

                         LITTLE OLD LADY
            Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't
            want to miss one minute of it.

THE FIRST NIGHTERS LEAVE THE BAR.  ALL THAT REMAIN ARE
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, THE BARTENDER AND THE DRUNK.
BIALYSTOCK SLIPS OFF THE STOOL AND WANDERS TO MIDDLE OF
BARROOM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (dazed)
            Got to think... Got to think... Got
            to think... Got to think... Got to
            think...

CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD.
HIS EYES ARE GLAZED WITH SHOCK.  HE STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH
HIS LITTLE BLUE BLANKET.

                         BLOOM
            Mrs. Cathcart -- 50%
            Mrs. Biddlecombe -- 50%
            Mrs. Wentworth -- 50%
            Mrs. Resnick -- 100%

THE DRUNK STARES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.  UNHAPPY WITH THEIR
PRESENT MOOD, HE DECIDES TO LIVEN THINGS UP AGAIN.  HE
TIPTOES OVER TO BIALYSTOCK, PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND BIALYSTOCK'S
WAIST, ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND BEGINS TO SING.

                         DRUNK
                   (singing)
            "By the light...
            By the light, by the light...
            Of the silvery...

BIALYSTOCK PICKS HIM UP AND THROWS HIM ACROSS THE BAR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Get away from me, you drunken bum!

                                                           76.


DRUNK PICKS HIMSELF UP AND DUSTS HIMSELF OFF.

                         DRUNK
                   (indignantly)
            Fairweather friend!

THE DRUNK STAGGERS OUT OF THE BAR.  BIALYSTOCK GETS A HOLD
OF HIMSELF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Maybe it's not true!

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES OVER TO BLOOM.

                         BLOOM
                   (still mumbling to himself)
            No way out.  No way out.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.

BLOOM DOES NOT RESPOND.  BIALYSTOCK SHAKES HIM.

                         BLOOM
                   (droning monotonously)
            No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Why don't we go over to the theatre
            and see what's really happening?
            After all, we've only heard from a
            small portion of the audience.
            Let's hear what the majority thinks.

                         BLOOM
                   (in a trance)
            The majority.  The majority.  Yes.
            Let's hear from the majority.

THEY START TO LEAVE.

DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING LOBBY OF THEATRE.
AS THEY OPEN DOOR TO THEATRE, THEY ARE GREETED BY A SHOCK
WAVE OF LAUGHTER.  THEY PAUSE STRICKEN.

                         BLOOM
            I don't want to go in.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come, we have to.

THEY TAKE EACH OTHER'S HANDS LIKE TWO FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOYS
AND CAUTIOUSLY WALK IN.

                                                           77.


CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AS THEY ENTER.  THEY TAKE THEIR
POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND WATCH THE PROCEEDINGS
MEEKLY, LIKE TWO LAMBS AWAITING THE SLAUGHTER.

CUT TO STAGE.  HITLER HAS OBVIOUSLY CALLED A COUNCIL OF WAR.
THE FUHRER IS SURROUNDED BY HIS GENERAL STAFF.

                         GENERAL
                   (making a report)
            We are falling back on all fronts.
            Our soldiers are retreating.

                         LSD
            No good, baby, no good.  You heard
            my orders.  Nobody retreats.
            Attack!  Attack!

                         GENERAL
            Who can we attack?  They're all too
            big.

                         LSD
                   (getting an inspiration)
            Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!

                         GENERAL
            We can't... we keep our money there!

CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE STRAIGHT
AHEAD, STONY-FACED.  HUGE TEARS WELL UP IN THEIR EYES AND
RUN DOWN THEIR CHEEKS.

CUT TO LIEBKIND.  HE HAS RIPPED OFF THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR AND
IS EARNESTLY GNAWING AT IT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Baby, again with that baby.  There
            must be no more babies.

LIEBKIND LEAPS FROM HIS SEAT AND HEADS TOWARD THE SIDE
ENTRANCE LEADING TO THE STAGE.

CUT BACK TO STAGE.

                         LSD
            Where's Goebbels?  Where's my
            little Joe?

                         GENERAL
                   (to the wings)
            Send for Goebbels.

                                                           78.


                         LSD
            He's the only cat left that still
            grooves me.

GOEBBELS ENTERS LAUGHING.

                         GOEBBELS
            Heil, baby!  I just finished the
            morning propaganda broadcasts.

                         LSD
            What did you tell the people?

                         GOEBBELS
            I told them we invaded England.

                         LSD
            Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we
            come out?

                         GOEBBELS
            We won.

                         LSD
            Groovy!

THEY SMACK HANDS.

LAUGH FROM AUDIENCE.

CUT TO BACKSTAGE.  LIEBKIND COMES CHARGING IN LIKE A LUNATIC.

                         LIEBKIND
            Bring down the curtain!  Bring down
            the curtain!

HE RUSHES FOR THE CURTAIN ROPE.  A STAGEHAND ATTEMPTS TO
STOP HIM.  HE RIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND BANGS HIM OVER THE
HEAD WITH IT.  AS HE SLUMPS TO THE GROUND, LIEBKIND UNDOES
THE CURTAIN ROPE.

CUT TO ACTORS ON STAGE.

                         LSD
            Goebbels, you're the only one...

THE CURTAIN DROPS WITH A THUD.  FROM BENEATH IT CRAWLS
LIEBKIND.  HE JUMPS UP AND ADDRESSES THE AUDIENCE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I am the author of this play.  You
            are the victims of a hoax.  These
            are not my words.  The Fuhrer never
            said baby.  The Fuhrer was sweet,
            the Fuhrer was kind, the Fuhrer was
            good.

                                                           79.


                         STAGE MANAGER
                   (off camera)
            Get that curtain up.

CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE.  LIEBKIND HURLS HIMSELF IT, AND
HOLDS IT DOWN.

                         LIEBKIND
            NO!  No!  The curtain must not go up!

DESPITE HIS EFFORTS, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  LIEBKIND
DOES NOT RELEASE HIS HOLD ON IT.  HE STARTS TO GO UP.

                         LIEBKIND
            Stop!  Stop!

AS THE CURTAIN RISES, WE SEE A BEWILDERED GROUP OF ACTORS
AND STAGE HANDS WATCHING LIEBKIND'S ASCENT.  THE AUDIENCE,
THINKING LIEBKIND'S BEHAVIOR PART OF THE SHOW, ENJOYS THE
PROCEEDINGS TREMENDOUSLY.  THEY BREAK INTO APPLAUSE.

CUT TO CRITIC.  HE IS LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY AND TEARING UP
HIS NOTES.

CUT BACK TO LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
            We have been betrayed!  I will
            return!  I will returnnnnn...

LIEBKIND DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLIES.

DISSOLVE TO ANTEROOM OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM'S OFFICE.  DAY.
ULLA, WEARING A BELTED RAINCOAT, SITS AT THE TYPEWRITER.
MUSIC FROM A RECORD PLAYER SOFTLY ROCKS IN THE BACKGROUND.
IN HER LEFT HAND SHE HOLDS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE, FROM WHICH
SHE SIPS, WHILE HER RIGHT HAND, INDEX FINGER EXTENDED, STABS
AT THE FUNNY LITTLE KEYS.  SHE IS HAPPY, IT IS THE RIGHT ONE.
THE DOOR FLIES OPEN.  THE DESPERATE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
ENTER.  ULLA LEAPS UP, QUICKLY UNDOES HER RAINCOAT, EXPOSING
HER DELICIOUS BODY, CLOTHED ONLY IN BLACK LACE UNDERTHINGS.

                         ULLA
            We make love?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go
            to work.

ULLA IMMEDIATELY TURNS UP RECORD PLAYER TO A CRASHING BLARE
AND DOES HER GROOVY DANCE.  BIALYSTOCK HOWLS IN DESPAIR AND
FLEES INTO HIS OFFICE TOGETHER WITH BLOOM.

                                                           80.


HE CLOSES THE DOOR, SHUTTING OUT THE NOISE.  THE OFFICE IS
FILLED WITH FLOWERS AND CONGRATULATORY TELEGRAMS.  BIALYSTOCK
SWOOPS DOWN ON THE TELEGRAMS.  HE RIPS ONE OPEN AND BEGINS
READING.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Congratulations.  It's the biggest
            hit on Broadway."

HE TEARS IT UP AND THROWS IT AWAY.  HE PICKS UP ANOTHER AND
READS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            "Congratulations.  Hitler will run
            forever."

HE THROWS IT AWAY.  BIALYSTOCK ATTACKS THE PILE OF TELEGRAMS.
WITHOUT OPENING THEM UP, HE TEARS THEM ONE AT A TIME.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (boiling with rage)
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Congratulations!

HE TEARS TELEGRAM.

THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.  POSED IN THE DOORWAY IS ROGER DE BRIS.
IN ONE HAND HE CARRIES AN OPEN, BUBBLING MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE.

                         DE BRIS
                   (ecstatic)
            Congratulations!  Have you seen the
            reviews?  Have you seen the lines
            at the box office?  It's a torrent,
            it's an avalanche, it's the biggest
            hit on Broadway!

HE STARTS INTO THE ROOM.  BIALYSTOCK GROWLS AND LUNGES AT HIM.

                                                           81.


                         BIALYSTOCK
            You lousy fruit.  You've ruined me!

HE SMASHES DE BRIS UP AGAINST THE WALL.  THE CHAMPAGNE GOES
FLYING.

                         DE BRIS
                   (shrieking)
            Help!  Help!  He's crazy!  He's
            going to kill me.  Call the police!
            Call the police!  Help, help,
            murder, murder, rape, rape!!!

BIALYSTOCK THROWS HIM OUT, SLAMS THE DOOR AND LOCKS IT.  HE
FALLS INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS HIS FEET UP ON THE DESK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (moaning)
            How could this happen?  I was so
            careful.  I picked the wrong play,
            the wrong director, the wrong cast.
            Where did I go right?  We forgot
            one important, Bloom.  Adolf Hitler
            always drew a crowd.

BIALYSTOCK IS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT BLOOM IS DOING STRANGE
THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you doing?

CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS FEVERISHLY PILING LEDGERS AND ACCOUNT
BOOKS TOGETHER.  HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, CLUTCHES
THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR.

                         BLOOM
                   (defensively)
            Don't try to stop me.  I've made up
            my mind.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            What are you doing with those books?
            Where are you going?

                         BLOOM
                   (with hysterical conviction)
            I'm turning myself in.  It's the
            only way.  I'm going to cooperate
            with the authorities.  They'll
            reduce my sentence and then there's
            time off for good behavior.  And
            maybe I'll get a job in the prison
            library.  So long.

                                                           82.


HE TURNS THE KNOB.  THE DOOR IS LOCKED.  HE FIDDLES WITH THE
CATCH.  TOO LATE!  BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH.
HE BLOCKS THE DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (reasonably)
            Leo, take it easy.  Relax, you're
            overwrought.  You don't know what
            you're doing.  You're acting out of
            panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS!

BIALYSTOCK LUNGES AT BLOOM AND GRABS FOR THE BOOKS.  BLOOM
STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD.  THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND FORTH.

                         BLOOM
            I never should have listened to you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            I never should have listened to you.

                         BLOOM
            Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Double.  Double.  Double.

WITH A MIGHTY WRENCH, BIALYSTOCK RIPS THE BOOKS OUT OF
BLOOM'S HANDS.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (clutching the books triumphantly)
            Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!

BLOOM FLIPS.  HE ATTACKS BIALYSTOCK LIKE A CRAZY KID,
SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE
PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER.

                         BLOOM
                   (shrieking)
            FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!

BIALYSTOCK GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT.
BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM.  THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR LOCKED IN
MORTAL COMBAT.  SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION.
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND
TURN TOWARD THE DOOR.

CUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR.  THEY DROP OFF.  A LITTLE
SMOKE RISES FROM THE HOLE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (off screen, outside door)
            I am betrayed!

                                                           83.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

CUT TO THE DOOR.  IT FLIES OPEN.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS
FRANZ LIEBKIND, SMOKING LUGER IN HAND.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (solemnly)
            You have broken the Siegfried Oath.
            You must die.

HE BLASTS AWAY.  THE WINDOW IS SHATTERED.  PIECES OF WALL GO
WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR.  BIALYSTOCK DROPS THE LEDGERS AND
HE AND BLOOM DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE DESK.

                         LIEBKIND
            This is no good.  I'm not killing
            you.  Don't you understand, you
            have broken the Siegfried Oath.
            You must die.  Vill you cooperate!!!

CUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCRUNCHED
BEHIND DESK.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT.  THERE
IS A TIMOROUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

                         BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM
                   (together)
            Come in.  Come in.

ULLA ENTERS.

                         ULLA
            I hear noise.  You call?

SHE LOOKS AROUND.

                         ULLA
            Where are you?

SHE CONTINUES WALKING UNTIL SHE SEES THEM CROUCHED BEHIND
THE DESK.

                         ULLA
            Ahhh.  I see you.  You like
            something?  Coffee?

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN DISBELIEF.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Coffee.  Yes.  That's a good idea.
                   (with great emphasis)
            Why don't you ask the gentleman
            with the gun... The gentleman who
            is shooting at us... and trying to
            kill us... what he will have.

                                                           84.


                         ULLA
                   (to Liebkind)
            You like coffee?

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER,
DUMBFOUNDED.

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes, please.  Black.  Two sugars.

ULLA REPEATS TO HERSELF AS SHE STARTS FOR THE DOOR.

                         ULLA
            Three coffees.  Two regular.  One
            black... two sugars.

SHE EXITS AND CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM.

BIALYSTOCK LOOKS UP TO THE FATES AND MAKES A SMALL SOUND OF
DESPAIR.

                         LIEBKIND
            And now ve must resume hostilities.
            Are you coming out from behind that
            desk or not?

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Not.

                         LIEBKIND
            Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.
            Clinging to life like baby
            butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and
            remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show
            you how to die like a man!

HE PLACES THE MUZZLE OF THE GUN AGAINST HIS TEMPLE.  BLOOM
AND BIALYSTOCK PEER OVER THE DESK TO SEE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (exhalted)
            Soon I vill be vit mine Fuhrer, und
            Goering, und Goebbels, and Himmler.
            I'm coming boys!

HE PULLS THE TRIGGER.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  THE GUN IS
JAMMED.  HE THROWS THE GUN DOWN IN DISGUST.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (in utter anguish)
            Boy, vhen things go wrong!

HE FALLS INTO A CHAIR AND SOBS LIKE A CHILD.

                                                           85.


                         LIEBKIND
            I'm a failure.  I'm a failure.  I'm
            a failure.

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME OUT FROM BEHIND DESK.  BIALYSTOCK
LOOKS AT HIS WATCH.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day
            playing hide-and-seek with a crazy
            Kraut.

BIALYSTOCK PICKS UP LUGER.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (still sobbing)
            I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.

HE CONTINUES TO SOB.  BLOOM WALKS OVER TO THE WEEPING
LIEBKIND AND COMFORTINGLY PATS HIM ON THE SHOULDER.

                         BLOOM
            There, there.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (looking around)
            Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Liebkind)
            You crazy lunatic!  What are you
            shooting at us for?  Why don't you
            use this
                   (indicates gun)
            where it will do us some good?  Why
            don't you shoot the actors?
                   (the thought strikes home)
            Liebkind, have I ever steered you
            wrong?

                         LIEBKIND
            Always.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Never mind.  Listen.  Every night
            people are laughing at your beloved
            Fuhrer.  Why?

                         LIEBKIND
            It's that LSD und his verdampter
            babies!...

                                                           86.


                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (handing him the gun
                   and some money)
            Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill
            them all!

                         BLOOM
            What???

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom)
            Shut up.

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy
            the actors.

LIEBKIND STARTS TO GO.

                         BLOOM
            Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

HE LEAPS ACROSS THE ROOM AND WRENCHES THE GUN FROM LIEBKIND'S
HAND.

                         BLOOM
                   (screaming)
            Have you lost your mind?  What are
            you talking about?  Kill the actors.
            You can't kill the actors --
            they're not animals, they're human
            beings!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            They are?  Have you ever eaten with
            one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!

                         BLOOM
            Liebkind, no!

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (to Bloom)
            What are you doing?  We're trapped.
            It's either the show or us.  There's
            no way out.  What can we do, blow
            up the theatre?

BIALYSTOCK FREEZES AS THE THOUGHT TAKES HOLD.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM.  HIS EYES NARROW AS HE SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERS THE PROPOSAL.

CUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND.  HIS FACE A POSTER OF SHINING
APPROVAL.

                                                           87.


CAMERA PULLS BACK.  THE THREE OF THEM SEARCH EACH OTHER'S
FACES EARNESTLY.  THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY IN ACCORD.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN.  DARKENED CELLAR OF THEATRE.  WE SEE THE FAINT GLOW
OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL.  AS THE CAMERA
MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE
OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.
BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP.  LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK
LOOSE FROM WALL.  BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP.  BRICK COMES
LOOSE.  LIEBKIND REMOVES IT.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (the surgeon at work)
            Dynamite.

BLOOM SLAPS A NEATLY TAPED BUNDLE OF DYNAMITE INTO LIEBKIND'S
HAND.  LIEBKIND GENTLY PLACES IT IN OPENING.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fuse cap.

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS HIM A FUSE CAP.
LIEBKIND PUTS CAP IN PLACE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Fuse.

BLOOM REACHES IN POCKET, TAKES OUT SPOOL OF FUSE, HANDS IT
TO LIEBKIND.

                         LIEBKIND
            Thank you.

LIEBKIND TIES FUSE IN PLACE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Gut.  Now for the master connection.

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AS THEY MOVE BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL.
LIEBKIND TRAILS FUSE FROM SPOOL.  THEY FINALLY EMERGE INTO
AN OPEN AREA OF CELLAR DIRECTLY BENEATH THE STAGE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Gut.  Now vhere's the other fuse?

BLOOM RAISES HIS LAMP, REVEALING A SIMILAR TUNNEL ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE CELLAR.

                         BLOOM
            There it is.

                                                           88.


CAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP SIMILAR FUSE PROTRUDING FROM SECOND
TUNNEL.

BACK TO SCENE.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (to Bloom)
            Pick it up and bring it here, please.

                         BLOOM
            Okay.

HE STARTS TOWARD SECOND TUNNEL.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (anxiously)
            Where are you going vit the light?

                         BLOOM
            I need it.  How'm I gonna find the
            fuse?

                         LIEBKIND
            Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one
            and all in the light.

THE THREE OF THEM GINGERLY TIPTOE OVER TO SECOND TUNNEL
ENTRANCE.  BLOOM PICKS UP THE FUSE.  THEY TIPTOE BACK.
BLOOM HANDS FUSE TO LIEBKIND.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS KNAPSACK, TAKES OUT LITTLE BLACK
METAL BOX WITH TWO TERMINAL CAPS AT EITHER END AND SETS IT
DOWN ON CELLAR FLOOR.

                         LIEBKIND
            Now ve take the two fuse leads,
            attach them to the terminals of the
            conductor and ve're in business.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (grinning)
            You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.

LIEBKIND BEGINS FIDDLING WITH THE FUSE LEADS AND TERMINALS.

                         BLOOM
            Max, I...

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (irritated.  He has
                   not time for small talk)
            What is it?

                                                           89.


                         BLOOM
            Well, I... Well, it's just that...
            I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (smacking Bloom
                   affectionately on the shoulder)
            Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (mumbling to himself)
            Plus to minus.  Negative to positive.
            Male to...

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Come on.  Let's get going.

                         LIEBKIND
            Qviet.  Qviet  This is very
            important.

HE TURNS BACK TO HIS WORK.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vait a minute.  Vait a minute.
            Male to male?  Male to female?
            Female to male?  Female to female?
            Vait a minute.  In people, male to
            female.  But electricity is strange.
            It's male to male.

HE QUICKLY FINISHES THE CONNECTION.

                         LIEBKIND
            Sehr gut.
                   (to Bialystock)
            Slow fuse, please.

BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS LIEBKIND A ROLL
OF FUSE.

                         LIEBKIND
            Thank you.

HE BEGINS TYING SLOW FUSE TO CONDUCTOR.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (as he works)
            Now ve take the slow fuse.  Tie one
            end to the master connection and
            the other ve attach to the detonator.

HE FINISHES CONNECTIONS.

                                                           90.


                         LIEBKIND
            Come, ve go to the detonator.

THEY BEGIN TO MOVE BACK AS LIEBKIND SLOWLY SPOOLS OUT FUSE.
THEY START UP THE STAIRS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Vait a minute.  Are you sure this
            is slow fuse?  It feels like qvick
            fuse.
                   (to Bloom)
            Shine your light on it.

BLOOM SHINES LIGHT ON FUSE.

                         LIEBKIND
            I don't know.  I don't know.  The
            markings are so similar.  Qvick
            fuse or slow fuse?

LIEBKIND TAKES A WOODEN MATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET.

                         LIEBKIND
            I must find out.  It is critical.

HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE.  WHOOSH!  IT
IGNITES.  THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION.
LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK
BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH.  HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST
BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS
IT OUT.

                         LIEBKIND
            Let's face it.  That was dumb.

HE TROTS BACK.

                         LIEBKIND
            Boys, vhere is you?

BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM COME CRAWLING OUT FROM BEHIND STAIRS.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (seeing them)
            Dot vas the qvick one.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            We assumed that.

LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND SHOWS THEM A ROLL OF
FUSE.

                                                           91.


                         LIEBKIND
            Here.  You see.  This is the slow
            fuse.  It is much wider.  It has
            more resistance, more density.
            Therefore, it burns slower.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You mean you had the slow fuse in
            your pocket all the time and you
            forgot to put it on?

                         LIEBKIND
            Yes.  Amazing isn't it?

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS CANE AND SMASHES LIEBKIND ON THE
HELMET.  BONNNG.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            You stupid kraut!

                         LIEBKIND
            Vhy do you always call me kraut?
            Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you
            hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not
            franks!

                         BIALYSTOCK
            All right.  Finish the job.  Let's
            get outta here.

CUT TO SIDE DOOR OF THEATRE.  THE DOOR OPENS SLOWLY.
BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND TIPTOE OUT.  BLOOM SETS
DETONATOR DOWN.

                         LIEBKIND
            Und now for the final connection.

HE WRAPS THE FUSE LEAD AROUND THE METAL CONTACT POLE AND
RAISES THE PLUNGER.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Wait.  I'll check to see if the
            coast is clear.

HE RUNS TO THE END OF THE ALLEY.  LOOKS BOTH WAYS AND RUNS
BACK.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            The coast is clear!

                         LIEBKIND
            Good.  Get down.

                                                           92.


BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS.
LIEBKIND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR.  HIS EYES
SUDDENLY GLISTEN WITH TEARS.

                         LIEBKIND
            Goodbye, my foolish fancy.  Goodbye,
            my misbegotten child.  Goodbye, my
            tortured testament of twisted truths.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do it!  Do it!

LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE.  HE STARTS AND STOPS.

                         LIEBKIND
            I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a
            demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a
            monster... but it's still my child.

HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY.  BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE
AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN.
HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN
ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  NOTHING HAPPENS.  AFTER A
WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (quizzically)
            Nothing.

LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES
DETONATOR.

                         LIEBKIND
            Here is gut... of course, of course.
            In electricity, it's always male to
            female.  But with people, it's not
            always so.  Come ve must go back.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            Do you need us?

                         LIEBKIND
            Of course I need you.  It's dark in
            there.

                         BLOOM
            Okay, okay.  Let's not waste time.

THEY OPEN THE SIDE DOOR AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE THEATRE.

                         DRUNK
                   (off camera, singing)
            "Honeymoon, keep a shinin' in June,"

                                                           93.


CUT TO ENTRANCE OF ALLEY.  DRUNK COMES STAGGERING INTO VIEW.
HE SPOTS DETONATOR.

                         DRUNK
            "your silvery beams,
            Will light love's dreams,"  What
            the heck is that?  A bicycle pump?
            Naaah.  Lemme see.  Could it be?
            Good grief, it's Eli Whitney's
            cotton gin... Naaah.  Aahh, I know
            what it is.

HE WALKS OVER TO DETONATOR AND SITS ON FIRE STANCHION JUST
BEHIND IT.  HE RAISES HIS FOOT AND STARTS IT DOWN TOWARD THE
PLUNGER.

                         DRUNK
            Shine 'em up!

HE PUSHES PLUNGER DOWN WITH HIS FOOT.

CUT TO LONG SHOT OF THEATRE.  (MOCK UP) THERE IS A TERRIFIC
EXPLOSION.  PIECES OF THE THEATRE GO FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF DRUNK.  HE IS ON HIS KNEES.  DEBRIS
CRASHES ALL AROUND HIM.  SMOKE AND NOISE FILL THE AIR.  HE
STAGGERS TO HIS FEET.  HE ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AS THOUGH HE
WERE IN AN EARTHQUAKE.

                         DRUNK
                   (bravely singing)
            "Sa-an Fra-ancisco, open your
            golden gates,
            Don't let a stranger wait...

DISSOLVE TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE'S GAVEL SOLEMNLY RAPPING FOR
ORDER.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL CROWDED COURTROOM.

CAMERA MOVES IN TO FOREGROUND OF COURT.  THERE, SEATED AT
THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE ARE, IN ORDER, BLOOM WITH HIS ARM IN A
SLING, BIALYSTOCK WITH HIS LEG IN A CAST, AND A MUMMY
SWATHED IN BANDAGES.  WE KNOW THE MUMMY IS LIEBKIND BECAUSE
IT IS WEARING A GERMAN HELMET.

                         LIEBKIND
                   (mumbling through his bandages)
            Male to male?  Male to female?

CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF JUDGE.

                         JUDGE
            Has the jury reached a verdict?

                                                           94.


CUT TO JURY.  THEIR EXPRESSIONS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE NOT
AT ALL WELL-DISPOSED TOWARD THE DEFENDANTS.

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON FOREMAN.  HE RISES.

                         FOREMAN
            We have, your honor.

                         JUDGE
                   (off camera)
            How does the jury find?

                         FOREMAN
            We find the defendants incredibly
            guilty.

CUT TO JUDGE.

                         JUDGE
            Will the defendants please rise and
            approach the bench.

CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND.  THEY STRUGGLE TO
THEIR FEET AND HOBBLE TO THE JUDGE'S BENCH.

                         JUDGE
            Do the defendants have anything to
            say in their behalf before the
            court pronounces sentence?

                         BLOOM
            I would like to say a word, sir,
            not on my behalf, but in behalf of
            my partner, Max Bialystock.

                         JUDGE
            Proceed.

                         BLOOM
            Thank you, your honor.  Max
            Bialystock is a very selfish man.

                         BIALYSTOCK
                   (whispers to Bloom)
            Don't help me.

                         BLOOM
            He's a liar and a cheat and a
            scoundrel.  He's taken money from
            little old ladies.  He's talked
            people into doing things they never
            would have dreamed of.  Especially
            me.  But who has he really hurt?
                         (MORE)

                                                           95.


                         BLOOM (CONT'D)
            Who are the victims?  Not me, I had
            the most exciting adventure of my
            life.  And what about the little
            old ladies?  What would their lives
            have been without Max Bialystock?
            He made them feel wanted and young
            and attractive again.

                         LITTLE OLD LADIES
                   (off camera, ad-lib)
            "Oh, Max, Max, I love you Max."
            "Let him go, let him go."
            "Don't take my Bialy."

                         JUDGE
                   (rapping gavel)
            Order.  Order.

                         BIALYSTOCK
            And may I humbly add, your honor,
            that we have learned our lesson and
            we'll never do it again.

                         JUDGE
            I will take that into consideration.
            The defendants shall serve not more
            than five and not less than two
            years in the State Penitentiary.
                   (he pounds gavel)

          FADE IN:

          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          The sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of
          Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't
          watching.
          As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,
          THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET
          MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo,
          and reading a manuscript.
          She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she
          hits a button to stop the treadmill...

          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD
          PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure
          out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same
          model on the walls.
          Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is
          6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.

          RICHARD
          Where are my clothes?
          A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the
          model on the walls and is really, really hot.

          SIMONE
          In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you
          some coffee?

          RICHARD
          Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late.
          Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block
          next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds
          his pants on the floor and puts them on.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Have you seen my belt?
          Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.

          SIMONE
          In here.
          She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half
          dressed.   He swallows a little throwup.

          RICHARD
          Baby, I just can't do this anymore.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Margaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the
          rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves
          off.

          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly
          gets dressed as he talks.

          RICHARD
          You're just too much for me.   And I'm just
          another guy too wrapped up in his job.

          SIMONE
          Fine.   Whatever.   Just go.
          Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.

          RICHARD
          Let's not end it like that. It's been an
          amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you.
          And you should know that you have the nicest
          ass I've ever been with.

          SIMONE

          (TOUCHED)
          You mean it?

          RICHARD
          I do.   It's magnificent.

          SIMONE
          I work really hard on it.

          RICHARD
          I know you do.
          Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her
          naked body.   Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I really gotta go.

          INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

          CRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while
          standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her
          reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher.
          Her apartment is very quiet.

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

          HONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the
          street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          INT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNING

          DING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit
          and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL
          PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at
          her phone as she lets it ring.

          MARGARET
          (to phone)
          I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me
          what I want to hear.   Give it to me.

          DOORMAN
          You have to put it by your mouth so people
          can hear you.

          MARGARET
          You should get paid extra for being so darn
          funny.
          Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out
          the door.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          This is Margaret.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks.

          INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

          Two coffees lie in wait for Richard.   JILLIAN, a lovely Barista,
          smiles as he hurries to the counter.

          JILLIAN
          You're running late today.

          RICHARD
          Jillian, you are the best.

          JILLIAN
          If you think I'm good at this, you should
          use that coffee cup sometime.
          As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at
          Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie.

          RICHARD
          See ya tomorrow.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

          The elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close.

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          4.
          Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors.   Inside the
          packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy.   One
          particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard.

          CO-WORKER #1
          How long is she gonna make us come in by
          seven?

          RICHARD
          She doesn't exactly consult with me on these
          things.

          CO-WORKER #1
          Well this sucks ass.

          RICHARD
          Welcome to my nightmare.
          The doors close as...

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

          Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.

          MARGARET
          You've been thinking about our talk because
          I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth,
          McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically
          whores himself.   Know what they have in
          common?   A Pulitzer.
          (off answer)
          Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty
          years, but that's how long it's been since
          you've written a book this good.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading
          6:56 and a sign that announces "Royce Publishing."   He hauls ass
          through a sea of cubicles.   Along the way, grumpy employees
          begrudgingly nod their good mornings.
          At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on
          without looking in the mirror.   Noticing his wrinkled suit, he
          pulls out a SPRAY BOTTLE out of the same drawer, sprays it all
          over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky
          cowlick.   Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking.   Employees
          avoid her and pile into the elevator.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          MARGARET
          I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books,
          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius
          piece of literature.   Do the publicity.
          Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes."
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're making the right decision!   Great
          news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm
          going to lose you...
          Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their
          mind.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Richard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on.   He picks
          up papers strewn about the room.   He goes back to the computer,
          and opens computer programs.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - RECEPTION - MORNING

          Margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic...

          RECEPTIONIST
          Good morning!
          Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff,
          who all look busy on the phone.   When she turns the corner, they
          stop their "conversations" in mid sentence and hang up.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out.   A
          clock above the door reads 7:00 AM.   The paper clears the printer
          and Richard grabs it quickly.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing
          at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other.
          Her office looks perfect.

          RICHARD
          You've got a conference call in thirty, a
          staff meeting at nine, and your immigration
          lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.

          MARGARET
          Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          6.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (big news)
          I got Frank to do publicity.

          RICHARD
          Nice job.

          MARGARET
          When I want your praise, I'll ask for it.
          Is Bob here?

          RICHARD
          I'm sure.   You want him on the phone?

          MARGARET
          We're going to his office.   Grab your pad.
          Richard calmly backs out of the office...

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

          ... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer
          and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed
          to Bob's office."

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to
          life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes
          their imaginary conversations.

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING

          Margaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup
          with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the
          hearts that dot the "I's" in Jillian.

          MARGARET
          That's cute.   You gonna call her today?

          RICHARD
          What?
          Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she
          nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed.

          MARGARET
          Are you bored here?   Do you need little
          distractions like that to get you through
          the day?

          RICHARD
          Uh...

          MARGARET
          You have another late night out?

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          7.
          Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried
          because he doesn't know where she's going with this.

          MARGARET
          I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got
          hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head,
          and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.

          RICHARD
          Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.

          MARGARET
          You'll magically unwrinkle?

          RICHARD
          Yes.

          MARGARET
          You have magic pants?

          RICHARD
          No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will
          take care of the wrinkles.

          MARGARET
          Does this work on more than just your pants?

          RICHARD
          Anything that's wrinkled.

          MARGARET
          Buy me some.

          RICHARD
          Will do.
          Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point.

          MARGARET
          I don't care what or who you do on your own
          time, but when you walk through that door
          you represent me, and I will not have your
          personal life affect you at work.   If you
          want me to think of promoting you to editor,
          I need you sharp, focused and professional.
          Got it?

          RICHARD
          Got it.

          MARGARET
          Great.   Now you're just a prop in here, so
          don't say a word.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          INT. BOB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with
          beautiful antiques and first edition books.   But unlike
          Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner.
          Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door.   BOB (42) wears a prim
          bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of
          superiority.

          MARGARET
          Hey, Bob.

          BOB
          Ah.   Our fearless leader and her liege.
          Margaret smiles.

          MARGARET
          I'm lettin' you go, Bob.

          BOB
          Pardon?

          MARGARET
          You're fired.

          BOB
          What?   What are you talking about?

          MARGARET
          This isn't working out.

          BOB
          You can't...

          MARGARET
          I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do
          publicity.   You said it was impossible.

          BOB
          It is.   He doesn't do publicity.

          MARGARET
          I just talked to him.   He's in.

          BOB
          But...

          MARGARET
          No more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a
          month and a half, and this is the third time
          you've dropped the ball.   You didn't even
          call to ask him.

          BOB

          

          

          

          

          9.

          MARGARET
          All you had to do to was pick up the phone.
          That's it.   Now I'll give you two months to
          find a new job, and then you can say you
          resigned.   I won't tell a soul, my lips are
          sealed.
          Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret and Richard walk a few steps.   Margaret looks straight
          ahead and whispers to Richard.

          MARGARET
          What's he doing?
          Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair
          and comes to his door.

          RICHARD
          He's up and about to pop.

          MARGARET
          Oh Bob, don't do it...

          BOB

          YOU POISONOUS BITCH!   YOU CAN'T FIRE ME!
          The office stops.   This is going to be good.   Margaret turns
          around with a disappointed look on her face.   She's deadly calm.

          MARGARET
          What are you doing?   I gave you a civilized
          way out of this.

          BOB
          This is because I'm your competition.
          Because I threaten you!

          MARGARET
          Oh, Bob.   You could never threaten me.   I'm
          firing you because you're lazy, entitled and
          incompetent.   I'm firing you because you
          don't work hard.   So if you know what's good
          for you, you'll shut up, take off that
          ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get
          drunk.   Because if you say one more word,
          Richard here is going to call security and
          have you thrown out on your ass.   Are we
          perfectly clear?
          Bob nods.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Good.   Now I've got work to do, so if you'll

          

          

          

          

          10.
          Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          We need to call his authors and explain what
          happened.   And get Frank's publicity
          schedule figured out pronto.

          RICHARD
          No problem.   I'll just cancel my trip this
          weekend.

          MARGARET
          I gave you the weekend off?

          RICHARD
          It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday.
          But no big deal.   You were right before, I
          need to stay focused.   Professional.

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - DAY

          Richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come
          home this weekend.   He sounds like an annoyed teenager.

          RICHARD
          Well tell gammy that I'm sorry.
          (waiting to speak)
          Mom, she's making me work this weekend.
          It's not like I volunteered.
          (waiting to speak)
          I'm sure dad is pissed.
          Margaret comes to Richard's desk.   He tries to wrap it up.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I have to go.   Yeah.   No, I'm not going to
          do that!   No.   Sorta.   Mom!   No.   Bye.
          Richard hangs up the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorry about that.   Damage control.

          MARGARET
          She tell you to quit?

          RICHARD
          No.   No.
          (off Margaret's look)
          Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them,
          after three years together, you're the only
          person on the planet who can make me editor,
          so that's the way it is.
          Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.

          

          

          

          

          11.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson?

          MARGARET
          Who is this guy?

          RICHARD
          He said you knew each other.   You weren't
          sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We
          rescheduled on him four times.

          MARGARET
          Go get him.   But he's out of here in five
          minutes, we've got work to do.
          Margaret leaves and goes into her office.

          RICHARD
          (to himself)
          I'll charge up the cattle prod.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense
          man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy
          you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read
          about it in P-W.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly,
          aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to
          know doesn't know already.
          Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man,
          but now gives up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Have to admit, I can't place where we know
          each other from.
          Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Three years ago?   We worked together.

          MARGARET
          Don't have it...

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Remember "Dandelion's Desire?"
          Margaret gets excited.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          MARGARET
          Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me?
          That book is legend.   Without a doubt the
          worst ever written.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You think?

          MARGARET
          It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and
          pointless pages, with like 30 characters,
          who all had some weird disability.   The
          paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering
          scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic
          alien chapter -- written entirely in his
          alien language.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I believe there was a glossary...
          Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.

          MARGARET
          Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?

          MR. GILBERTSON

          (QUOTING)
          "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do
          not confuse superior form with writing
          ability.   Save your skills for the office
          newsletter, you sir, are no writer."
          A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact...

          MARGARET
          You wrote the book.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I did.

          MARGARET
          You're Dante Dickens?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          One of my nom de plumes.
          Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You
          obviously were spending a lot of time
          writing, I just thought you should channel
          all that passion into something else.
          Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and
          Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you
          to Canada.

          MARGARET
          Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've
          lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for
          citizenship.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You need citizenship now?   After the big
          promotion?

          MARGARET
          Yes.   And all the papers are in.
          Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Well, my office is going to reject your
          paperwork on Monday, while we investigate
          whether your behavior is well disposed to
          the good order and happiness of the United
          States.   We must protect our sovereignty.

          MARGARET
          I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the
          United States?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will
          take awhile, so you'll be deported while
          your case winds through the system.
          (as if he doesn't know)
          Will it affect you at work if you aren't
          allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two
          to three years?

          MARGARET
          "Affect me at work?"   I'll lose my job!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (mock sympathy)
          Ahhhh.   That's a shame.   Too bad we can't
          work something out.
          Margaret stops looking at her file.   It all becomes clear.

          MARGARET
          Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Do what, Ms. Mills?

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          14.
          Gilbertson smiles.   She's quick.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I've edited it down.   It's better.

          MARGARET
          Well then, get it published at another
          house.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          They all just don't get me.

          MARGARET
          All?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Well not all.   Two hundred fifty, two
          hundred sixty-one.   Ish.

          MARGARET
          I'll be fired and laughed out of the
          industry if I publish that book.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm
          an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a
          lunchable to work everyday and lives in his
          brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and
          I'm desperate.

          MARGARET
          I will never publish your book.   Ever.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          There's no need to make this difficult.   I
          don't turn in your file until Monday...

          MARGARET
          This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I've spent two years preparing for this day.
          Don't you think I've thought of that?
          Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there
          is an "emergency" so Margaret can end the meeting.

          RICHARD
          Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs
          you right away.
          The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson
          with a wicked grin on her face.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          MARGARET
          Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere!
          We're getting married!
          Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.

          RICHARD
          Who's getting married?

          MARGARET
          We are!

          RICHARD
          You and him?

          MARGARET
          Stop playing around, honey.
          Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him
          about us.   About us getting married.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You are marrying your male secretary?

          RICHARD
          Assistant.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You are marrying your male assistant?

          MARGARET
          (matter of fact)
          We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When
          it's right, it's right.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And this has nothing to do with my visit
          here today?

          MARGARET
          Nope.   True love.   Got it bad.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (to Richard)
          You.   Is this true?   Are you marrying
          this... woman?
          Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.

          MARGARET
          Of course we are.

          MR. GILBERTSON

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret
          squeezes Richard's hand hard.

          RICHARD
          Uh-huh.
          Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm
          around her.   Richard is truly afraid.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (more of a question)
          I'm, uh, marrying my boss?
          Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that
          she's ready for a kiss.   The two slowly begin to come together.
          Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out
          and kisses the hair on the top of her head.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Five years in prison and a two hundred and
          fifty thousand dollar fine.

          MARGARET
          What?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          If I prove you're lying, you go to federal
          prison for five years.
          Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          You.   Do you know what you're getting
          yourself into?   We're going to put you in a
          room and ask you every detail that a real
          couple would know about each other.   Do you
          even know her favorite color?
          Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly
          veiled threat.

          MARGARET
          C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice.
          Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.

          RICHARD
          Plum.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You mean purple?

          RICHARD
          No.   Plum is "smokier" than purple.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Favorite flower?

          RICHARD
          Tulips.   But only when they're in season.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Childhood pet name?

          RICHARD
          Miss Mittens.

          MARGARET
          Are we done here?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Who knows you're getting married?
          Margaret interrupts.

          MARGARET
          No one.   With us working together we decided
          it would be too much of a scandal if anyone
          knew.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Have you at least told your family?

          MARGARET

          (EXCITED)
          My parents are dead!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          How convenient.   So you're not telling
          anyone that you are getting married?

          RICHARD
          Nope.
          Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got
          enough to send you to prison...

          MARGARET
          We're telling his family this weekend.

          RICHARD
          We are?

          MARGARET
          Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them...
          (trying to remember)
          ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And where's that going to be?

          MARGARET
          (no idea)
          At Richard's parent's house.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And where's that located?

          MARGARET
          (still no idea)
          In his hometown.

          RICHARD
          Sitka.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Is that on Long Island?
          Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover.

          MARGARET
          Why don't you tell him?

          RICHARD
          Alaska.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You're going to Alaska this weekend?

          MARGARET
          (Alaska???)
          Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska.
          That's where Richard is from.
          Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You think you can beat me with this B-S
          story?   Forcing your secretary...

          RICHARD
          Assistant.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...assistant to marry you and then
          conveniently telling his family for the
          first time this weekend?

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for
          that?
          Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.

          

          

          

          

          19.
          Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his
          appointment book and writes down some information.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          The INS will see you both in ten days for
          your official interview.   Your stories
          better match up on every account.
          Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her
          the piece of paper.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          Cross all your T's and dot your I's with
          this ruse, Ms. Mills.

          MARGARET
          There are no "T's" or "I's" in "Love" Mr.
          Gilbertson.
          Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to
          her desk like this is all in a days work.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus,
          that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going
          to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and
          girlfriend this weekend for your parents and
          that should be enough for this INS
          interview.
          Richard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          So you need to figure out the travel,
          schedule a justice of the peace for next
          week, and get my lawyer on the phone.
          Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          But first, run down and get me another
          coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold.
          Margaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Hello?   Richard?   Richard!
          Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.

          RICHARD
          I quit.
          Richard leaves Margaret's office.   She still has her coffee cup
          outstretched in her hand.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS

          Richard powers through the office.   Co-workers take notice that
          Margaret is following him.

          MARGARET
          Richard, come back here.
          Margaret tries not to make a scene.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Richard.   Richard.
          Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Come back to the office!
          Richard can't take it.   He gets up in Margaret's face.

          RICHARD
          You shut up.   You just lost your "I get to
          tell Richard what to do" privileges.

          MARGARET
          Well, we need to talk.

          RICHARD
          You want to talk with me?   Fine.   Grab your
          broom and let's go.
          Margaret is dumbstruck.   The receptionist is shocked.   The
          elevator arrives and Richard gets in.   Margaret follows. As the
          doors close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Watch my phones!

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret walk in silence through the park.   Richard
          finally speaks.

          RICHARD
          Your plan is psychotic.

          MARGARET
          Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play
          pretend girlfriend, but this is the big
          time.   Sometimes you need to sack up.

          RICHARD
          Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice?

          MARGARET
          You wanna be an editor?   You need to make

          

          

          

          

          21.

          RICHARD
          OK.   Fine.   Then if we "make this happen"?
          You're promoting me to editor.

          MARGARET
          I'm doing what?

          RICHARD
          We go to Alaska and lie to my family?   I
          risk going to jail?   Well, you're making me
          editor for that.   I mean, did you think I'd
          do this out of the kindness of my heart?

          MARGARET
          You work for me!

          RICHARD
          You know, during my employee orientation,
          the HR rep didn't mention anything about me
          marrying you.

          MARGARET
          Look, I came to this town alone and with
          nothing.   I've worked my ass off for fifteen
          years and this guy wants to ruin me because
          he wrote the shittiest book of all time?   No
          way.

          RICHARD
          Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that
          sounds like your problem.   Not mine.
          Margaret is stuck.   Richard really does have the upper hand.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   You take me to Alaska this weekend,
          and I'll make you editor.   Deal?
          Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a-
          bed, we're staying in a hotel.   Do they even
          have hotels in Alaska?

          RICHARD
          No.   But they have huts.   Teepees really.
          And you have to poop in a bucket.   But
          otherwise, just like the Four Seasons.   But
          with bears.

          EXT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY

          A commercial jet TAKES OFF and leaves New York City behind.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          INT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret sit in First Class and work on their lap
          tops.   Richard looks up.

          RICHARD
          Um.   Shouldn't we talk about what we're
          going to say to my parents?
          Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question.

          MARGARET
          Are you done with the press release?

          RICHARD
          Almost.

          MARGARET

          (PATRONIZING)
          Well let's finish big people business before
          mommy and daddy talk.   Okay?
          Dejected, Richard goes back to work.

          INT. SEATTLE AIRPORT - DAY

          As they change planes in Seattle, Margaret walks quickly and
          talks on the phone.   Still the assistant, Richard lags behind,
          weighed down by both their bags.
          Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES
          final boarding to Sitka.   Margaret gets off her phone.

          MARGARET
          So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet
          points.

          RICHARD
          I told âem we've been dating for six months.
          We've kept it a secret from everyone...
          (under his breath)
          ...and that you're a naughty minx in the
          sack.
          Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate.
          Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor.

          MARGARET

          (VENOMOUS)
          Don't make me hate you.
          Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes
          through.   The attendant gives Richard a look.

          RICHARD
          Bringing her home to meet my folks.   She's

          

          

          

          

          23.
          Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass.
          The impatient attendant is getting frustrated.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've got it here.   Sorry.   Guess I'm a
          little flustered too.   Haven't been home for
          awhile, hope they like her!
          The gate attendant smiles.

          GATE ATTENDANT
          (heard it all)
          I don't care, sir.
          Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over.

          RICHARD
          OK then.   You're a sweet lady.   Thanks.
          Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors.

          INT. PLANE TO ALASKA - DAY

          Margaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed HANDSOME
          MAN who is READING A BOOK.   She notices the title and he catches
          her stare.   Margaret explains.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at
          what I'm reading.   It's just... I worked on
          that book.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You wrote it?

          MARGARET
          Edited it.   It was one of my favorites.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Well you did a good job.   It's great.

          MARGARET
          You don't see many guys with that book.
          You, uh, read a lot of love stories about
          Roman concubines?

          HANDSOME MAN
          My ex-girlfriend gave it to me.   I travel a
          lot for work.   I'll read anything...

          MARGARET

          (SUSPICIOUS)
          Ex-girlfriend, huh?

          

          

          

          

          24.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (smiling, embarrassed)
          OK, you got me.   I'm a closet romantic.   But
          let's keep that between us.
          Margaret smiles and makes the "my lips are sealed" motion.   Just
          then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags.

          MARGARET
          There you are.   Give me my lap top.
          Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.

          RICHARD
          (re: book)
          Hey, he's reading...

          MARGARET
          I know, Richard.
          Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead
          compartment.   The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Did you two want to sit together?

          MARGARET
          Sit together with who?
          The Handsome man nods at Richard.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Your boyfriend?
          Margaret points to Richard indignantly.

          MARGARET
          You mean him?
          The Handsome man nods.   Margaret tries to set the record
          straight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          No.   No.   No.   He's my assistant.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You're bringing your assistant all the way
          to Alaska?
          Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer.

          RICHARD
          Oh, you can tell him the truth.

          MARGARET
          Well, he's... indispensable.

          

          

          

          

          25.
          The Handsome man isn't buying it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          And gay.   Takes care of me everywhere I go.
          Call him my queen mother.   Aren't you my
          indispensable gay queen mother?
          Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look.   He has to go along.

          RICHARD
          That's me.
          Richard turns to close the overhead compartment.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You're awfully nice to fly him first class.
          Margaret nods her head and agrees.   It sucks to be Richard.

          EXT. AERIAL OF SITKA - DAY

          We see the natural beauty of South Eastern Alaska.   Sitka is an
          island the size of Maui.   Only an eight mile stretch of coast is
          inhabited, the rest is complete wilderness.   At the center of the
          island is a mountain with smaller hills around it.   The coast is
          dotted with fishing boats.   Gorgeous.

          INT. JETWAY - DAY

          Margaret and the Handsome Man chat like old friends while they
          walk off the plane.   Richard follows with all the bags.   As they
          all walk out of the jetway they see...

          INT. AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          A big banner that reads: CONGRATULATIONS RICHARD AND MARGARET!!!
          with wedding bells and a graphic showing the journey from New
          York to Sitka.   The banner is being held up by a group of 30
          PEOPLE with excited looks on their faces.
          Richard's mom DEBBIE (60) is front and center.   She's a sweet
          lady who cooked Richard a hot breakfast every morning until he
          left the house.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (89) also waits.   She's lived a long time and
          doesn't have a lot of time to screw around.
          When they see Richard, they SCREAM.   Margaret's face drops.

          ALL
          There he is!!!   Where's Margaret?
          Richard blanches white.   Margaret looks back with eyes that say
          "What the hell is going on?"

          

          

          

          

          26.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (noting banner)
          That's sweet.
          Richard goes over to the group.   Margaret keeps walking.

          RICHARD
          What are you guys doing here?   What's with
          the sign?

          DEBBIE
          So you're "just dating," huh?   I can't
          believe you didn't tell us!

          RICHARD
          Didn't tell you what?

          ANNIE
          We're not saying anything until you let us
          meet Margaret.   Now, where's our girl?
          Richard looks around.   Margaret keeps her head down and tries to
          avoid eye contact.

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Margaret?   You need to come over here.
          Like now.   Honey.
          The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for
          Margaret to come over.   Margaret winces.

          MARGARET
          I have to go now.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (putting it together)
          What kind of sick shit is this?
          Margaret nods.   This would be a tough one to explain.

          MARGARET
          Have a great life.
          Margaret walks toward the group.   Richard puts out his hand and
          silently pleads for Margaret to hold it.   At the last second, she
          takes it.

          RICHARD
          Everyone, this is Margaret.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's nice to meet you.   Now, do you prefer
          being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady?
          We've heard it both ways.
          Everyone laughs.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          DEBBIE
          Annnie!

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's not like he hasn't told her that he
          used to call her the Dragon Lady.   They're
          getting married.

          RICHARD
          (real "casual")
          Now, ah, where did you hear that?   The whole
          "getting married" thing?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, that man from the government.   Gilber-
          something.   Said he was checking up on you
          two.   Said it was technicality, because
          Margaret was from Canada.

          RICHARD
          What, ah, did you tell him?

          DEBBIE
          Well for one thing, that you were in a lot
          of trouble for not telling us that you two
          were getting married!

          RICHARD
          No.   Really.   What did you say?

          DEBBIE
          Just that you were coming up here this
          weekend.   That we hadn't seen you in a
          while, and that we'd heard about Margaret
          for years, but that we'd never met her.
          Debbie turns to Margaret and takes both of her hands.
          DEBBIE (CONT'D (cont'd)
          The way that Richard talked about you?   I'll
          admit, I didn't see this coming.

          MARGARET
          Me neither.
          Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the
          exit.   Everyone else follows her lead.

          ON THE MOVE

          DEBBIE
          So why all the silly secrecy?

          RICHARD
          It wasn't a secret.   We didn't tell anyone.

          

          

          

          

          28.

          DEBBIE
          Well, is your family just anyone?

          RICHARD
          No, I didn't mean...

          DEBBIE
          I should be mad at you two.   But, but... I'm
          just so excited!

          MARGARET
          (re: group)
          Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, we cancelled your reservation.   You're
          part of the family now.     Family doesn't
          stay at a hotel.   Also, we've got another
          little surprise for you two.

          MARGARET
          Surprise?   Another surprise?

          RICHARD
          She's not good with surprises.

          MARGARET
          I'm really not good with surprises.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Debbie stops.   Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already
          outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone.
          Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other.

          DEBBIE
          Well you two...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          ...you're getting married this weekend!

          MARGARET                                                           RICHARD
          What?                                                              What?
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          The whole kit and caboodle.
          Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you
          talking about?"

          DEBBIE
          When Gilber-something told us you were
          getting married...

          GRANDMA ANNIE

          

          

          

          

          29.

          DEBBIE
          ...God rest their souls...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          ...or friends...

          DEBBIE
          ...we decided to give you a wedding.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Engagement party tonight...

          DEBBIE
          ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
          Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.

          MARGARET
          Are you witches?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good
          luck.   It's an Alaskan thing.

          DEBBIE
          We've planned everything.
          Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time
          left.   Richard lives so far away, and I
          never see him.   Now I find out he's getting
          married, and I have a chance to see my one
          grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come
          true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let
          me see Richard get married before I die.
          Please.
          Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.
          Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally,
          she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up.
          The crowd cheers.

          EXT. SITKA - DAY

          A procession of cars makes its way through town.

          INT. PICKUP - DAY

          Debbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles.
          Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible
          in the backseat of the extended cab.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out
          the window.   Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives
          Margaret a "what did you do that for" look.

          MARGARET

          (MOUTHING)
          The Dragon Lady!?
          Richard shrugs.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the
          plans made already for my birthday.   Just a
          few changes here and there, and we made this
          weekend a wedding.
          Margaret stares at Richard.

          MARGARET
          I'm a lucky woman.
          Margaret does her best to smile.

          EXT. DOCK - DAY

          The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small
          dock.   Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the
          ocean.   Margaret is confused.

          MARGARET
          I'm not getting out of this car until you
          tell me where we're going.

          RICHARD
          Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise.
          Richard points to a small island about a mile away.

          EXT. YACHT - DAY

          Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht.   Lots of polished wood and
          chrome.   Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is
          festive.   Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene.

          MARGARET
          Who are you people?
          Richard lets Margaret wonder.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate.
          It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as
          a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be.
          Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear

          

          

          

          

          31.

          GEOFFREY
          So you must be Margaret.   We've heard a lot
          about you.   All of it bad.
          Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical
          sling backs.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he
          was marrying the devil woman.

          MARGARET
          I thought it was the dragon lady?

          GEOFFREY
          Either way.

          RICHARD
          Hey dad.
          Richard shakes his father's hand.   It's a little stiff.

          GEOFFREY
          Welcome home.   Good to see âya.

          RICHARD
          You too.

          GEOFFREY
          Been a while.

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   You'd think you could make it to the
          airport to mark the occasion.
          Grandma Annie interrupts.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Help him with the bags Geoffrey.
          (to Richard and Margaret)
          Let's get you two settled.
          As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
          Geoffrey a look that says "be nice".

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          The house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor.   Somehow, it
          makes bear heads and deer antlers look good.   Everything is first
          class.   Margaret is a little awe struck.

          DEBBIE
          We'll show you around later.

          MARGARET
          Uh huh.

          

          

          

          

          32.
          Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps
          on her.

          DEBBIE
          Balzac!   Down!   No!
          Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the
          kitchen.   Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small
          talk.

          MARGARET
          What a great name.   Balzac's "Lost
          Illusions" is one of my favorite novels.

          DEBBIE
          Oh.   Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis.
          Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to
          illustrate how Balzac really got his name.
          Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks
          away.   Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that
          this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          No one on the island wanted him when he was
          born.   We figured he deserved a home.

          GEOFFREY
          And don't let him outside, or the eagles
          will snatch him.

          RICHARD
          C'mon dad...

          GEOFFREY
          I mean it.   They come out of that
          rehabilitation center mean.   And hungry.

          RICHARD
          Don't listen to him, Margaret.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE UPSTAIRS - DAY

          Debbie opens a door for Richard and Margaret.

          DEBBIE
          You'll be sleeping here.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          The room is beautiful, right out of Architectural Digest.

          DEBBIE
          Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the
          armoire by the bed.   Just let me know if you

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MARGARET
          Thank you.   Where's Richard's room?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago.
          And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that
          you two haven't slept in the same bed
          before.   Richard can sleep here too.

          MARGARET
          Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.

          DEBBIE
          It was her idea.   Anything to help get her a
          great grandchild.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.

          MARGARET
          Great.   You know, I've gotten used to his
          breathing at night.

          DEBBIE
          I thought so dear.
          Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her
          old self.

          MARGARET
          I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.

          RICHARD
          Calm down.

          MARGARET
          What is going on here?

          RICHARD
          Hell if I know.

          MARGARET
          You had no idea they knew about us getting
          married?

          RICHARD
          You think I'd bring you here if I did?

          MARGARET
          Well, we just gotta tell âem.

          RICHARD
          Tell âem what?

          MARGARET
          Tell âem the truth.   About us.

          

          

          

          

          34.

          RICHARD
          Wrong answer.   No way.

          MARGARET
          What do you mean no way?   This is crazy.

          RICHARD
          No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.

          MARGARET
          Well I don't like this.

          RICHARD
          Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice
          to a Class C felony!   For one second could
          you not be so selfish?

          MARGARET
          Selfish?

          RICHARD
          Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you
          only worry about yourself every second of
          every day?

          MARGARET
          How is it selfish to tell the truth?

          RICHARD
          Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the
          last forty eight hours, we've lied to...
          everyone.   We need to protect the people
          downstairs.   We can't ask these good,
          decent, not awful people to lie for us.
          Let's keep the darkside to ourselves.
          Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop
          lying to me.

          RICHARD
          What've I lied to you about?

          MARGARET
          Why did you tell me that you were poor?

          RICHARD
          I never said that.

          MARGARET
          Well, you never told me you were rich.

          RICHARD
          When does that come up?

          

          

          

          

          35.

          MARGARET
          I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is
          Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry."

          RICHARD
          Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you
          would have fired me if you knew.

          MARGARET
          No I wouldn't.

          RICHARD
          Come on!   You're always yammering on about
          your scrappy childhood, and how you fought
          for those soccer scholarships, and how the
          rich kids made fun of you in prep school for
          working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti-
          rich.

          MARGARET
          I'm not anti-rich.

          RICHARD
          Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it
          worse?   You have money!

          MARGARET
          I earned...

          RICHARD
          ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah.
          You need new material.

          MARGARET
          Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant.

          RICHARD
          You were going to promote me anyway.

          MARGARET
          Sure of that?

          RICHARD
          Nope.   Not at all.
          Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.

          MARGARET
          Well, come on.   If we're going to do this,
          we might as well put on a show.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing.   The starched
          wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party-
          goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats.

          

          

          

          

          36.
          Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy
          hair and beards.   No dress code here.
          Like the house, the party is first class.   Ice sculptures melt,
          champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows
          with salmon and king crab.
          Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some
          WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.

          MARGARET
          I went to Union college in upstate New York.
          It's a small liberal arts school that no one
          has ever heard of.
          Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (looks at glass)
          Lime?

          RICHARD
          Be right back.
          Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges.   Geoffrey elbows Debbie in
          the side, "What was that?"

          WELL WISHER #1
          How long have you been with your company?

          MARGARET
          Since I graduated college.
          Richard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't
          say thank you.

          RICHARD
          She's been there since she was nineteen.

          GEOFFREY
          Nineteen?   Wow.   That's how long?

          MARGARET
          Oh, who's counting...
          Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.

          GEOFFREY
          No.   How many years is that?   Exactly.
          Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.

          MARGARET
          Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or
          seventeen years.   Exactly.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          GEOFFREY
          I was never good with big numbers.   That
          makes you... thirty six now?

          MARGARET
          Just turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th.
          I'm a Taurus.
          Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          I need some protein.

          RICHARD
          There's some salmon.
          Margaret shakes her head no.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Crab?
          Margaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter.
          Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.

          GEOFFREY
          Keep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he
          roll over when you whistle?
          Debbie hits Geoffrey.

          DEBBIE
          He's just being a good host.
          Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's
          benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.

          MARGARET
          Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet.
          Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.

          RICHARD
          Uh, sure.   Honey.

          WELL WISHER #2
          So you just got some big promotion?

          MARGARET
          I'm editor in chief, now.
          Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.

          RICHARD

          (BEAMING)
          I'm so proud of my girl.

          

          

          

          

          38.
          From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Editor in chief?   You're marrying up,
          Richard.
          Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is
          Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.   Adding insult to
          injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on.

          RICHARD
          Gert!?
          Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and
          spilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what
          he's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved.
          RICHARD (cont'd)

          (FLUSTERED)
          What are you?   What are you doing here?

          GERTRUDE
          Your dad made me come.

          RICHARD
          From Chicago?
          Gertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the
          first time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has
          forgotten about Margaret completely.

          GERTRUDE
          No.   I live here now.

          RICHARD
          You what?

          GERTRUDE
          I moved back about six months ago.   I'm
          teaching second grade.   At Baranof.

          RICHARD
          Did your husband move up here too?

          GERTRUDE
          Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced.

          RICHARD
          Oh my God.   I'm sorry.

          GERTRUDE
          Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna
          meet the bride.
          Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.

          

          

          

          

          39.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert.

          MARGARET
          You're a Gertrude?

          GERTRUDE
          A family name from hell.

          MARGARET
          I'm sure it's been a curse.

          GEOFFREY
          Gert and Richard were quite the item in high
          school.
          Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh Please.   Ancient history.

          GEOFFREY
          Feels like yesterday to me.

          GERTRUDE
          (ignoring Geoffrey)
          So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't
          exactly love at first sight?

          MARGARET
          Not exactly...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Now Richard, what I want to know is how you
          proposed.
          This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a
          story like this.

          RICHARD
          Well...
          Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Uh, uh, um, I...

          GEOFFREY
          Yeah.   How did you pop the question?
          Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly.
          Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.

          MARGARET
          Can I tell this one, honey?

          

          

          

          

          40.

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Sure.

          MARGARET
          I'm an early, early riser and go for a run
          everyday.   Well, it was our six month
          anniversary and I was out for my normal jog
          in the park, when who do I see in a horse
          drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting
          for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So
          I ran up to the carriage and asked him what
          was going on, and he put his finger to his
          lips and says, "shhhh."   So there I am in my
          jogging clothes, next to the most handsome
          mute in the world - have you seen him in a
          tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and
          smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later,
          we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best
          part, we're the only people in the place
          because Richard got them to open up early.
          Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just
          as the sun starts to peek above the trees,
          this beautiful man gets down on one knee,
          and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to
          go by without you knowing that you are the
          light of my life, and that I would be the
          luckiest man in the world if you would be my
          wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry
          me?"
          The group is silent, waiting for the clincher.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I said yes.
          The group gives a collective "ahh".   Grandma Annie takes both
          Margaret and Richard by the hand.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          You are a good boy Richard, and you make me
          very proud.   I love you Richy.

          RICHARD
          I love you too, Grandma.
          Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and
          Gertrude.

          GEOFFREY
          So did this happen before or after the INS
          agent came sniffing around?

          DEBBIE
          What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret.
          Margaret doesn't miss a beat.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          MARGARET
          Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my
          lawyers have been dealing with all of this.
          When you told us at the airport it was the
          first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so
          embarrassed.

          DEBBIE
          Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass.
          While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink
          that says "I've got this under control".   The moment is
          interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He
          takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.

          RICHARD
          Margaret Mill's phone.
          (off answer)
          One second please.
          Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          It's our friend, Frank.
          Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.

          MARGARET
          Excuse me, I'll just be a second.
          Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that
          lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't
          notice Balzac follow her outside.

          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac
          follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.

          MARGARET
          Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the
          wishy washy writer who changes his mind
          every two seconds.
          Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING
          to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.
          Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the
          phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Balzac)
          Sit and be quiet!
          Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone
          back to her ear.

          

          

          

          

          42.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I fired Bob because he didn't have your best
          interest in mind.   Our job is to help you
          succeed.   He wasn't doing that.
          Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she
          notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not
          sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him
          peacefully sit in the grass.
          She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret
          shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --
          WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and
          takes off.   Margaret jumps.
          There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.
          She stays calm on the phone.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Could you hold on just a second?
          With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the
          eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and
          Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened.
          Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone
          and picks it up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (NONCHALANT)
          Sorry, dropped my phone.
          Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in
          circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get
          back to the house.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything.
          But know this.   This book is your legacy...
          Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac
          again.   She runs.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to
          introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me-
          tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is-
          always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon.
          The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle
          is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone
          to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs
          Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          

          

          

          

          43.
          Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the
          eagle as an offering.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Take the dog!   Take the dog!

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE

          Inside, the elegant party carries on.

          DEBBIE
          Where's Margaret?   We need to go.

          RICHARD
          Go where?

          DEBBIE
          It's a surprise.   Girls are going into town.
          And the boys stay here.   I told you, we've
          planned everything.

          RICHARD
          Um.   She's outside.
          Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window.
          They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head.

          DEBBIE
          Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my
          Balzac.

          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY

          The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the
          dog trying to bait it back.

          MARGARET
          This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.   C'mon,
          bring back the phone.
          Richard calls out from the house.

          RICHARD
          What are you doing?

          MARGARET
          The eagle took my phone!

          RICHARD
          Are you drunk?

          MARGARET
          Your dad was right!   The eagle tried to take
          the dog, so I saved it, then it came back
          and took my phone.

          

          

          

          

          44.

          RICHARD
          Did the dingo eat your baby, too?

          MARGARET
          Frank's going to call me on that phone.   I
          need it!

          RICHARD
          Relax.   I've got your information backed up
          on the laptop.   I'll just get you a new
          phone and switch the number.   No problem.

          MARGARET
          Oh.

          RICHARD
          Now come on.   You're going somewhere with my
          mom and the girls.

          MARGARET
          I'm not going anywhere.

          RICHARD
          You want a new phone?   You're going.

          EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY

          The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures
          of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home.
          But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women CHEERING
          for an oiled, toned, and BEARDED MAN in a tiny thong who gyrates
          to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker."   On stage with the
          dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her NOVELTY

          BACHELORETTE PARTY WEDDING VEIL WITH DEVIL HORNS.

          DEBBIE
          Work it Hank!

          GERTRUDE
          Is that a salmon down your pants?
          The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from
          Margaret's face.   Margaret remains straight faced.

          MARGARET
          Definitely not a salmon.
          The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
          wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and
          embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the
          splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation.
          Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She
          begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HANK
          Ah, ah, ah.   I was just the warm up.
          Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.

          MARGARET
          What's going on?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Just sit there dear.

          MC
          Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often,
          show Hank how much you appreciate his
          assets!   And now... Ramone!
          The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the
          stage.   He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache.
          Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it.
          Margaret is oblivious.

          MARGARET
          What's that smell?
          Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about
          an inch away from her face.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (belly laugh)
          Ahhh!!!
          Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone.
          After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger
          at her naughty behavior.

          RAMONE
          You are a naughty devil.
          Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns,
          Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies.

          MARGARET
          Good lord.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Ramone was the only male dancer on the
          island for years. No one has the heart to
          tell him to hang it up.

          MARGARET
          Want me to do it?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Thank you dear, but let's keep it our
          secret.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - SHORELINE - DAY

          Snow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf
          balls into the ocean.   Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made
          up to look like golf greens.   Golf balls are stacked in pyramid
          formations at every hitting area.
          Richard comes down from the house to join the group.   Geoffrey
          jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls.

          GEOFFREY
          ...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that
          dissolve in the water.

          MAGUIRE
          How does she come up with this shit?

          GEOFFREY
          She just does.   I stopped trying to figure
          out how.
          Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.   Mr.
          Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.

          MAGUIRE

          (JOKING)
          I'm mad at you, son!

          RICHARD
          Why's that, Mr. Maguire?

          MAGUIRE
          You fly up here and don't call me?

          RICHARD
          Sorry âbout that.

          MAGUIRE
          What good is me owning an airline if I can't
          give you free tickets?

          RICHARD
          You're right.   Don't know what I was
          thinking...

          MAGUIRE
          Damn, straight.   Don't let it happen again!
          (hands Richard a golf club)
          Here, you take over.   This game is for
          pussies, I'm getting a drink.
          Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
          one another for the first time.   Things are awkward between
          father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid
          conversation.   Geoffrey finally makes small talk.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          GEOFFREY
          Maguire's stepping down in January.   He's,
          uh, handing things over to Matty.
          Richard gives his dad a look.   He knows where this is going.

          RICHARD
          That's great for them.

          GEOFFREY
          So.   How's work with you?

          RICHARD
          Good.   Busy.   You know.

          GEOFFREY
          I do.   I do.   Hey, did I tell you that we're
          opening a little office in Japan?

          RICHARD
          Congratulations.

          GEOFFREY
          We're not just a mom and pop operation
          anymore.   We're going global.

          RICHARD
          Uh-huh.
          Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.   He's been
          thinking about this moment for a long time.

          GEOFFREY
          I could really use your help.

          RICHARD
          Dad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's
          in New York.   We have jobs.

          GEOFFREY
          I know.   I know.   It's just...

          RICHARD

          (CHALLENGING)
          It's just what?

          GEOFFREY
          You're only a secretary.
          This pisses Richard off immediately.

          RICHARD
          Again with the secretary thing!   I've told
          you, I'm an assistant!

          

          

          

          

          48.

          GEOFFREY
          Just because you call yourself an
          "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really
          just a secretary.

          RICHARD
          Well if I'm "just a secretary", why would
          you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like
          you're doing great without me.

          GEOFFREY
          It's not like that and you know it.

          RICHARD
          Then how is it?   Explain it to me.
          Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.

          GEOFFREY
          Last week, a man stuck his finger up my
          butt...

          RICHARD
          This man was a doctor?

          GEOFFREY
          ...and it got me thinking about you.

          RICHARD
          I'm not sure this is coming out right.

          GEOFFREY
          Just shut up for a second, okay?   I want you
          to have what I built.   But I'm running out
          of time to show you things.

          RICHARD
          Stop being so dramatic.

          GEOFFREY
          I'm not being...
          (takes a hard line)
          I need you to stop dicking around down there
          and get serious.

          RICHARD
          So this is all about what you want?

          GEOFFREY
          That's not what I said.

          RICHARD
          And me in New York with Margaret?   That
          isn't serious?

          

          

          

          

          49.

          GEOFFREY
          One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the
          next day she's the love of your life?   How
          is that serious?

          RICHARD
          Things change, dad.

          GEOFFREY

          (INDIGNANT)
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Things change.

          GEOFFREY
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Yes.   Things change.

          GEOFFREY
          Things change.   That's your explanation?
          Know what I think?   I think you banged your
          boss and fell in love, that's what I think.
          Some sorta mommy complex.

          RICHARD
          Nice, dad.   We gotta have these Cosby
          moments more often.   This is great.
          Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.

          EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY

          Margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself.   She's on a
          patio overlooking the ocean.   It is late, but the sun is hanging
          just over the horizon.

          GERTRUDE
          They can be a little overwhelming, but
          they're great people.

          MARGARET
          What?   I'm just working on my tan.
          (off Gertrude's look)
          It's been a long day.
          Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.

          GERTRUDE
          Around the solstice they don't watch the
          clock.   Pretty much party âtil they fall
          over.

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          50.

          GERTRUDE
          I actually missed it when I was in the
          states.

          MARGARET
          Chicago, right?

          GERTRUDE
          Yeah.   Since college.

          MARGARET
          And now you're back?

          GERTRUDE
          Six months now.   Call me crazy, but I love
          it.   Think I'm back for good.

          MARGARET
          Really?   I don't know.   Don't you miss...

          GERTRUDE
          Neimans?   Starbucks?   Escalators?
          Margaret laughs.   She likes this woman.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I
          never thought I'd end up divorced and back
          here teaching at my old elementary school.
          That was always Richard's plan.

          MARGARET
          For you to get divorced?

          GERTRUDE
          (smiles, remembering)
          No.   I was going to teach, he was going to
          run his dad's business.   He was like a
          little old man.   Had it all worked out.

          MARGARET
          Are we talking about the same guy?

          GERTRUDE
          What do you mean?

          MARGARET
          Well, Richard's such a player.
          Gertrude looks confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I mean he was a total player.   Before we
          started dating.   Six months ago.

          GERTRUDE

          

          

          

          

          51.

          MARGARET
          That surprises you?

          GERTRUDE
          Did he ever tell you why we broke up?

          MARGARET
          We don't really talk much about stuff like
          that.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh.   Well I should shut up...

          MARGARET
          No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting
          married.   I want to know these things.
          Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.

          GERTRUDE
          He proposed to me.   When we were seniors.
          Margaret laughs.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed
          to you in high school?

          GERTRUDE
          He bought this sweet little ring, and got
          down on his knee.   It was so cute.

          MARGARET
          You must have...

          GERTRUDE
          ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up
          with him on the spot.

          MARGARET
          I would hope so.

          GERTRUDE
          After getting rejected the first time, I
          can't imagine how hard it was for him to get
          up the courage to ask you.
          Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is
          being so honest with her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Anyway.   The idea that my little old man
          could be a player...   It's just not the
          Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an
          honest man of him again.

          

          

          

          

          52.
          Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in
          one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get
          another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up,
          let's get back to the girls.

          MARGARET
          I'll be right in.
          Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside.
          Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          We are awful people.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          THWACK!   An axe slams down and splits a log in two.   Hands
          quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find
          Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after
          talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage
          Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.
          Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.
          Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's
          mood deflates when she sees Richard.

          DEBBIE

          (SHOUTING)
          Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK?
          With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear
          or see the girls.
          Annie shakes her head.   Something is up.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

          Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch
          plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step
          in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the
          door, not sure what is going on.

          GEOFFREY
          Excuse me?   I'm watching that.

          ANNIE
          Why is Richard chopping wood?

          DEBBIE
          And don't play dumb.   What did you do?
          Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          GEOFFREY
          Nothing.   I didn't do anything... will you
          please move.
          The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself.

          MARGARET
          I am so tired.
          Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad.
          Margaret just smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Think I'm going to take a shower and clean
          off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for
          a great night.
          Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once
          she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He
          looks genuinely unnerved.

          GEOFFREY
          Stop looking at me like that!

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite
          a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through
          shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.   Ew.   He stinks.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and
          shuts the door.   We hear her turn on the shower.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

          Geoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great
          conviction.   Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but
          doesn't notice anyone.   He continues to listen to his iPod and
          his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the
          playlist "Songs I Shouldn't Like" and Charlene's hit "I've Been
          to Paradise, But I Haven't Been to Me."

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY


          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches
          for a towel.   All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative
          hand towel.   Shit.

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings "...I've been
          undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't

          

          

          

          

          54.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret's ears perk up.   The bathroom is a disaster because she
          has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel.

          MARGARET
          Richard, is that you?

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an
          incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was.   Richard
          isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting
          for her.   How did she miss that?

          MARGARET
          Richard, are you...
          Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles
          Margaret.

          BALZAC
          Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
          Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass.   Her foot
          kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy.

          ON THE BEDROOM'S DECK
          Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on
          the deck attached to the room.   He makes sure that no one is in
          the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret
          manages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel
          badly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you.
          Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs
          the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.

          ON THE BEDROOM DECK
          Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is
          open.   That's weird.

          

          

          

          

          55.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,
          ready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues
          to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows
          that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then
          she spots the bathroom mat.

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.
          Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top.
          Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls
          hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the
          bathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the
          door behind her and...

          IN THE BEDROOM
          WHAM!   Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.
          It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each
          other buck naked.

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                        Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up.   A
          rapid fire back and forth ensues.

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Why are you naked?                                                   Why are you wet?

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Don't look at me!                                                    You tackled me!

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          It was the dog!                                                      You're blaming the dog again?

          MARGARET
          Will you just hand me a towel!
          Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks
          under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're flashing brain!
          Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls
          the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way,
          and she wraps herself in it.

          

          

          

          

          56.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You can cover up any time!
          Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by
          the window.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Explain yourself!

          RICHARD
          I didn't know you were home!   I was outside
          chopping wood!

          MARGARET
          You didn't hear me?

          RICHARD
          I had my iPod on!

          (CONFUSED)
          Why did you jump me?
          Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.

          MARGARET
          I didn't jump you.
          (off Richard's look)
          I didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know
          you were here.

          RICHARD
          You didn't see me?

          MARGARET
          I was running from the dog!
          Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.

          RICHARD
          Wait.   Were you tryin' to seduce me?

          MARGARET
          Oh please!   Don't flatter yourself.

          RICHARD
          Mmm-Hmmm.

          MARGARET
          Go take a shower.   You stink.

          RICHARD
          Fine.   But don't come sneaking in there.
          You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual
          harassment.

          

          

          

          

          57.
          Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes
          a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up
          again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his
          neck.   He gently puts him outside their room.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before
          she makes a coat out of you.
          Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without
          looking back, Richard gets the final shot.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Puppy hater.

          LATER
          Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find
          to create himself makeshift bed on the floor.
          Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with
          the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed.

          MARGARET
          I'm never gonna to get to sleep.
          Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down
          outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and
          the room is pitch black.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh.   Well.   Thanks.
          Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two
          silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.

          RICHARD
          It was kinda weird seeing you naked.

          MARGARET
          Can we not talk about this?

          RICHARD
          I'm just saying.   It was weird.

          MARGARET
          It wasn't weird.

          RICHARD
          How was that not weird?

          MARGARET
          Because we're... like teammates.

          RICHARD
          We're like teammates?

          

          

          

          

          58.

          MARGARET
          We are teammates.   And teammates see each
          other naked in the locker room.   All the
          time.   It's not a big deal.

          RICHARD
          Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the
          bed?

          MARGARET
          Good night, Richard.
          The two lay awake in silence for another beat.

          RICHARD
          Margaret?

          MARGARET
          Yes?

          RICHARD
          Don't take this the wrong way.

          MARGARET
          Okay...

          RICHARD
          You're a very beautiful woman.
          Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.

          MARGARET
          Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY

          Not a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into
          his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic
          oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code
          on a piece of paper.   He dials.

          GEOFFREY
          Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey
          Paxton...
          Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the
          rest of the conversation.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor
          with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long,
          before there is a KNOCK on the door.

          MARGARET
          Who is it?

          

          

          

          

          59.

          DEBBIE (O.S.)
          It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in
          bed.   Can I come in?

          MARGARET

          (STALLING)
          Uh, sure.   Just a second.
          Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden
          sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head.

          RICHARD
          What the...

          MARGARET

          (MOUTHING)
          Your mother.
          Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his
          makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts
          his arm around Margaret.

          RICHARD
          Come on in mom!
          Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.

          DEBBIE
          Well, it's your special day.
          Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on
          the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've
          got your dress fitting, have to get the
          house ready, and then your wedding.

          RICHARD
          I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new
          phone.

          DEBBIE
          Will you pick up some champagne while you're
          there?

          RICHARD
          No problem.

          DEBBIE
          And don't be gone for too long.   Lots of
          work to be done!

          

          

          

          

          60.

          MARGARET
          You don't have to go to all this trouble.
          Really.
          Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.

          DEBBIE
          Don't be silly.   This is the biggest day of
          your life.   You are coming into this family,
          and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If
          your parents were with us, they would do the
          exact same.
          Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard
          jumps out of bed and goes to the food.

          MARGARET

          (TOUCHED)
          Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had
          someone make me breakfast in bed since I was
          a little kid.
          Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.

          RICHARD
          (mouth full)
          I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught
          us.   Damn, that was close.
          Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay
          attention to Margaret.

          MARGARET
          You just take all this for granted?   Your
          family, this house...
          Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.

          RICHARD
          (mouth full)
          I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these.
          Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.

          MARGARET
          Why are you doing this to them?

          RICHARD
          Huh?

          MARGARET
          Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me
          here.

          RICHARD
          You made me bring you here!   You told me I

          

          

          

          

          61.

          MARGARET
          I didn't make you do anything.   You could of
          said no.

          RICHARD
          And what?   Start over at the bottom again?
          No way.

          MARGARET
          I get why a not rich person would do this.
          But you've got everything.   It doesn't make
          any sense.

          RICHARD
          Know what?   This is none of your business.

          MARGARET
          I wish it wasn't my business.   But
          unfortunately, it has become my business,
          because I made a deal with someone I thought
          I could trust.
          Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated.

          RICHARD
          You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show
          you why you're here.

          MARGARET
          Fine.

          RICHARD
          We leave in a half hour.

          MARGARET
          I'll be ready in 20 minutes.
          Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it
          down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for
          clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          These are really good.
          She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret board the yacht.   They wear athletic clothes
          and running shoes.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY

          Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.

          

          

          

          

          62.

          EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY

          Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in
          the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
          warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the
          pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
          processed.   Everything is clean and organized.
          Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS
          that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute.
          Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
          BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.

          BEK BEK
          Hey, Richard!   That the lucky lady?

          RICHARD
          Yes sir, it is!

          BEK BEK
          (to Margaret)
          You look much younger than everyone says.

          MARGARET
          That's great to hear.

          RICHARD
          See ya on the line, Bek Bek.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Richard opens a locker and points.   We don't see at what.

          RICHARD
          Put this on.   I'll meet you outside.

          MARGARET
          But I don't...

          RICHARD
          Ah.   Put it on.

          EXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.   She's
          wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing
          boots, and gloves.

          MARGARET
          Is this really necessary?

          RICHARD
          You'll thank me later.
          Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her

          

          

          

          

          63.

          INT. SLIME LINE - DAY

          Inside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different
          stations process the fish that come off the boats.
          At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head
          decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a
          guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves
          when he sees Margaret and Richard.

          MARGARET
          Why is he handcuffed to the machine?

          RICHARD
          So his hands don't go too far.   So he
          doesn't...
          Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces.

          MARGARET
          Nice.
          From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where
          their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a
          vegetarian for six months in college.
          Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long
          line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are
          frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller
          line and clean out all the left over intestines.

          WORKER
          There he is!   Big city boy come to show us
          how its done.

          RICHARD
          Ah, it's been a while.

          WORKER
          C'mon.   Show her how we do it.

          RICHARD
          Okay, okay.
          Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly
          demonstrates with a knife.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you
          don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt
          the knife, and then pull with the grain of
          the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the
          organs attached to the spine.

          

          

          

          

          64.
          Margaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the
          blood out of the vein.   Then send her down
          the line.
          Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before
          offering a knife to Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Wanna try it?
          Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          If it's too gross for you...

          MARGARET
          Gimme that.
          Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.
          Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible
          between her and the salmon.

          RICHARD
          I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me
          to earn my stripes before I took over.

          MARGARET
          Is that why you're still pissed at him?

          RICHARD
          Nah, I loved it here.

          MARGARET
          (re: fish guts)
          You loved this?

          RICHARD
          The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the
          slime line.   I loved this place.   The
          people.   Growing up, running this place was
          all I wanted.
          Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.

          MARGARET

          (DISGUSTED)
          You wanted this?

          RICHARD
          I wanted to run this place. It was
          comfortable here.   It was what I knew.
          (re: fish)
          Don't forget the spine.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          MARGARET
          I wasn't gonna forget.
          Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on
          its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.

          RICHARD
          But then things changed.   And it wasn't so
          comfortable anymore.

          MARGARET
          What kind of things changed?

          RICHARD
          Stuff.

          MARGARET
          (as if she didn't know)
          You mean, like, Gertrude?

          RICHARD
          Yeah...
          Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Oh my god.   She told you didn't she?

          MARGARET

          (INNOCENT)
          Told me what?
          Richard is embarrassed.   He turns away.

          RICHARD
          About the... you know.

          MARGARET
          The creepy teenage proposal?

          RICHARD
          Ah, shit!

          MARGARET
          You were a freak by the way.

          RICHARD
          OK, get it all out.

          MARGARET
          And she was right to break up with you.

          RICHARD
          You done?
          Margaret nods yes.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I know now that it was the right thing, but
          it screwed me up for a little while.

          MARGARET
          For a little while?   Don't sell yourself
          short.

          RICHARD
          When Gert crushed my heart into little
          pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great
          anymore.

          MARGARET
          So you moved to the open arms of New York
          City?

          RICHARD
          At first it was about getting as far away
          from this place as possible, but then I fell
          in love with it.

          MARGARET
          With scheduling my pilates?

          RICHARD
          With editing.   See, as an only kid I'd
          always read a lot, but until I worked for
          you I didn't love it.   I mean, when I
          realized that we could find the next
          Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or...

          MARGARET
          (with reverence)
          ...To Kill a Mockingbird.   It's all about To
          Kill a Mockingbird.

          RICHARD
          Exactly!   We could find the next To Kill a
          Mockingbird.   God damn, how great is that?
          Margaret smiles.   She never knew that Richard had this kind of
          passion for the job.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          So when I tell my folks that I want to spend
          my life finding books?   My dad goes ape
          shit.                                                             "How dare you forsake your family...
          you'll come crawling back to us... you're
          nothing without our help."   I left that
          night and we didn't talk for a year.
          Haven't been back here since.

          MARGARET
          So we're "getting married" so you can give
          daddy the finger?

          

          

          

          

          67.

          RICHARD
          No.
          Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorta.   OK, Yes.   Coming back here with
          you...   I get the promotion and I get to
          show off.   You're editor in chief.   You make
          a good prop.

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          I guess that's a compliment.

          RICHARD
          So now you know I'm a petty asshole.   Am I
          trustworthy again?

          MARGARET
          Oh yeah, we're good.   By the way, you're
          more screwed up than I am, Paxton.

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   Thanks.

          MARGARET
          One more question...

          RICHARD
          Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a
          lesbian.

          MARGARET
          That wasn't my question.

          RICHARD
          I know.   Just lashing out.
          Margaret smiles.

          MARGARET
          Can we stop gutting fish?   I need my phone.

          INT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret enter the well appointed general store,
          filled with food, booze and electronics.   A mini Wal Mart.

          RICHARD
          Hey Ramone.

          RAMONE
          Hey Richard.   Hola mi amo.
          Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.

          

          

          

          

          68.

          MARGARET

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Hey.
          They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know him?

          RICHARD
          He was my shop teacher.

          MARGARET
          Of course he was.   How many people are on
          this island?
          They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.

          RICHARD
          Like eight thousand?   Depends on the time of
          the year.

          MARGARET
          Feels smaller.
          With the cart full they head to the checkout.

          RICHARD
          (to Ramone)
          You got the phone I called about?

          RAMONE
          Charged up, ready to go, number changed.
          Ramone throws Richard a phone.

          RICHARD
          Thanks, Ramone.

          RAMONE
          No problem.
          Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back.
          Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay.
          Margaret is confused.

          EXT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up.

          MARGARET
          Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?

          RICHARD
          It's our stuff.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign.

          MARGARET
          That must have been handy in High School.

          RICHARD
          You have no idea.

          MARGARET
          Should you leave the cart?

          RICHARD
          It's our cart.   I didn't know you were such
          a prude.

          MARGARET
          I've come to realize that being my assistant
          gave you more access to my life than I ever
          imagined, but there are a few things you
          don't know about me.

          RICHARD
          I doubt it.   When I started, you were still
          wearing those Ugg boot things.

          MARGARET
          (deadly serious)
          I told you never to talk about that.

          RICHARD
          I'm just saying it's been a long time.   I
          know it all.
          Margaret turns on her new phone.   It searches for a signal.

          MARGARET
          (up to the challenge)
          Did you know I took disco lessons in the
          sixth grade?

          RICHARD
          Where?

          MARGARET
          The Y.

          RICHARD
          Margaret 1, Richard 0.

          MARGARET
          Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.

          RICHARD
          At Woodstock?

          

          

          

          

          70.

          MARGARET
          I won tickets on the radio and saw them at
          the fair.

          RICHARD
          What'd they sing again?

          MARGARET
          You know.

          (SINGING)
          Cherish the love we have, we should cherish
          the life we live...
          Richard shakes his head.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Well they were good.

          RICHARD
          You had a lot of soul there, Canada.

          MARGARET
          I really like "The O.C.".   Not fake, ha, ha
          isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really
          like it.

          RICHARD
          Wow.   I'm getting shut out here.

          MARGARET
          Allergic to pine nuts.

          RICHARD
          Knew that.

          MARGARET
          Afraid of penguins.

          RICHARD
          Huh.

          MARGARET
          Haven't slept with a man in a year and a
          half.

          RICHARD
          Holy shit!   You are a lesbian!
          A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty
          look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (to mother)
          My bad.
          The mother walks on.   Margaret is mortified and walks faster.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          MARGARET
          Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that
          gets a Holy shit?   I've been busy!

          RICHARD
          That's a really long time.

          MARGARET
          That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.

          RICHARD
          I knew it had been slow going, but I figured
          there was a booty call in there somewhere.

          MARGARET
          Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.

          RICHARD
          I find that hard to believe.

          MARGARET
          No, not that.   I'm great at that.   Aces.
          Top notch.

          RICHARD
          I'll have to take your word for it.

          MARGARET
          Yes.   You will.

          RICHARD
          How, exactly, do you define top notch?
          Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone.   In
          an instant, she's all business.

          MARGARET
          I need a computer and the internet.   Now.

          INT. FISHERMAN'S NET INTERNET CAFE - DAY

          Designed to attract tourists, the Fisherman's Net is awash in bad
          nautical props and fishing gear.   A bored TEENAGE CLERK in a
          PIRATE OUTFIT greets Margaret and Richard.

          PIRATE
          Aye lassie, welcome to the cyber seas.   Our
          T-1 line is faster than a clipper ship in a
          hurricane, but for now ye be needing to
          scrawl your mark on this sign up sheet.
          Margaret looks and sees that all the computers are taken.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          MARGARET
          No, no, no.   I need on now.   I've got a
          Booker prize winning author demanding I send
          him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes
          explaining why he should stay with a
          publishing house that "makes" him do
          publicity.
          The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese.

          PIRATE
          Arrgh...

          MARGARET
          Listen to me asshole...
          The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear.

          PIRATE
          Look lady.   You gonna put your name down on
          the list or not?
          Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard pulls her
          back.

          RICHARD
          C'mon.   I got an idea.
          Richard leads Margaret to the door.   As they are leaving Margaret
          shouts out.

          MARGARET
          I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in
          Alaska!

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret sits at a computer, furiously opening her e-mail.
          Richard has brought her to his elementary school, where he and
          his old principal, MRS. WHITING, stand over Margaret.

          MRS. WHITING
          I'm so excited about the wedding!

          RICHARD
          Thanks for letting us use your computer.

          MRS. WHITING
          No problem.
          (to Margaret)
          So what flowers are you going with?
          Margaret turns around annoyed, but manages to keep her cool.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, but could I have a minute alone

          

          

          

          

          73.

          MRS. WHITING
          Oh.   Sure.

          RICHARD
          Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting?   It's
          been years.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALL - DAY

          Richard and Mrs. Whiting walk around the elementary school.

          MRS. WHITING
          Do you think she'll be long?   I've got work
          to do.

          RICHARD
          She'll be out of there in two shakes.
          Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a
          class of second graders.   He stops transfixed.

          MRS. WHITING
          (re: Gertrude)
          We are so lucky to have her.   Mr. Megher
          really left us shorthanded when he ran off
          in the middle of the school year.   He's
          living out in the forest now with his
          wolves.   Full time.
          Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said.   He's
          hypnotized by Gertrude.   She looks happy teaching these kids, and
          they hang on her every word.
          MRS. WHITING (cont'd)
          Will you excuse me?   The bell is about to
          ring, I need to get ready for recess.

          RICHARD
          (not paying attention)
          Uh, sure.
          Mrs. Whiting leaves.   Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees
          him.   Good lord can that woman smile.   She waves him in.

          INSIDE THE CLASSROOM
          The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door.

          GERTRUDE
          Class, this is my old friend Richard.

          CLASS
          (all together)
          Hi Richard!

          

          

          

          

          74.

          GERTRUDE
          Richard and I used to be in this very same
          classroom together.   We even had your old
          teacher, Mr. Megher.

          CHILD #1
          Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs!
          The class giggles.

          GERTRUDE
          That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick.
          The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Marcia?

          CHILD #2
          Sorry.
          The child sits back down.   Gertrude waits a beat.

          GERTRUDE
          OK, everyone is excused for recess.
          All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs
          traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude.

          RICHARD
          Patrick's right.   He did smell like eggs.

          GERTRUDE
          It's still not a nice thing to say.   And
          actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog
          and...
          (makes smoking pot motion)
          ...Matanuska Thunderfuck.   But let's keep
          that between us.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret reads over her e-mail to Frank.

          MARGARET

          (READING)
          I give you my word as an editor and a
          friend...
          The door opens suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (STERN)
          Five more minutes!   Please!

          

          

          

          

          75.
          Margaret turns to find a PIG TAILED GIRL in the doorway.
          Terrified.   She SHRIEKS and runs off.   Margaret wants to
          apologize, but needs to keep working.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (WEAKLY)
          Sorry.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

          Gertrude and Richard wipe down the chalk boards together.   They
          are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport.

          RICHARD
          Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this
          after school for a week?

          GERTRUDE
          That was your fault.

          RICHARD
          Was not!

          GERTRUDE
          You tried to kiss me.   A girl has to defend
          herself.

          RICHARD
          C'mon!
          (Tom Cruise ala Top Gun)
          I had the shot.   I took it.
          Gertrude rolls her eyes.   She's heard this a hundred times.

          GERTRUDE
          No Top Gun.   Please.

          RICHARD
          What?   You loved my Top Gun.

          GERTRUDE
          No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled
          and laughed like a good girlfriend.

          RICHARD
          That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous.
          Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise.
          Gertrude is not impressed.

          GERTRUDE

          (LAUGHING)
          Really.   Stop.

          RICHARD
          That cuts deep.   I'll have you know that

          

          

          

          

          76.
          Talk of Margaret immediately shuts Gertrude down.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (noticing her change in mood)
          Uh, is something wrong?

          GERTRUDE
          No.   Nothing's wrong.

          RICHARD
          It's been awhile, but I can still tell when
          something's wrong with you.
          Gertrude doesn't want to say anything.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          What is it?   You know I hate it when you get
          all quiet.

          GERTRUDE
          I wish there was a better way to say this.

          RICHARD
          Better way to say what?

          GERTRUDE
          I made a huge mistake.   With you.   Breaking
          up with you.   I'm sorry.

          RICHARD
          Are you apologizing for high school?

          GERTRUDE
          Yes.

          RICHARD
          Oh, thank God.   I thought this was like,
          something big.

          GERTRUDE
          This is something big.

          RICHARD
          I coulda used this about five years ago, but
          I'm all good now, promise.   Thank you for
          saying that, though.
          Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point.   She pulls
          herself together.

          GERTRUDE
          I think...
          (looking down)
          I want you back.

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          77.

          GERTRUDE
          (more to herself)
          Oh God, he's making me say it again.
          (looking at Richard)
          I want you back.   Like... we should be
          together.   All the time.

          RICHARD
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.   Rewind.

          GERTRUDE
          I know this isn't the best time to bring
          this up.

          RICHARD

          (RHETORICAL)
          My wedding day isn't the best time for you
          to bring up the idea of us dating?
          Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.
          Bringing this up is very hard for her.

          GERTRUDE
          I'm not talking about dating!   You should
          move back here.   We can have the life you
          always talked about in High School.   I'm
          ready for that now.

          RICHARD
          Why are you doing this?

          GERTRUDE
          I know that the timing here sucks.   But we
          are meant to be together.   I know it.   I
          think you know it too...

          RICHARD
          No, I don't.   I don't know it.
          Richard begins to pace.   Not sure what to say.   Every time he
          opens his mouth, he can't find the words.
          Then, from the door, an interruption.

          MARGARET
          Hey guys.
          Holy shit.   Did Margaret hear anything?   Her face gives nothing
          away.   Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but
          look guilty as hell.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh.   Hey Margaret.

          RICHARD
          Uh, you all done?

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   We'll see what he says.

          RICHARD
          Great.   Great.

          MARGARET
          You ready to get back to the house?

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Yeah.   Uh-huh.

          MARGARET
          Well let's go.   See you at the wedding,
          Gertrude.
          Gertrude just smiles.

          GERTRUDE
          Yeah.   See you at the wedding.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret unload champagne.   Richard is still thinking
          about Gertrude and wanting to be alone.

          MARGARET
          So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?
          Richard lies.

          RICHARD
          Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and
          stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher
          was a pot head.

          MARGARET
          That was it?   I was gone for awhile...

          RICHARD
          (cuts her off)
          Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do
          this.   You should really go try on the dress
          for my mom.

          MARGARET
          I was going to go for a run first, it's been
          three days since I got out, I'm feeling
          crazy.

          RICHARD
          (could care less)
          Whatever.
          Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but
          doesn't push it.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY

          Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running
          hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's
          accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her
          own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.

          MARGARET
          What now?
          Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She
          soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN
          dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a
          carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as
          he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
          that sounds centuries old.

          SHAMAN
          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
          pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani
          takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm.
          Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance.
          He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
          Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Margaret, welcome!
          She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Come to me, Margaret of New York.
          Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          It is I, father Paxton.
          Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.

          MARGARET
          What, ah, are you doing?

          GEOFFREY
          My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and
          clear my head.   As you know, things have
          been a little crazy around here.   You should
          join me.

          MARGARET
          Ya know, I've got to get back.

          GEOFFREY
          You closed minded southerners amuse me.
          Never willing to leave the nest and try

          

          

          

          

          80.

          MARGARET
          I'm a big fan of the nest.
          Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.

          GEOFFREY
          Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you
          deny my circle.
          Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.

          MARGARET
          OK, OK.   I "accept your circle."
          Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.

          GEOFFREY
          Clear your mind and follow me.
          Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret
          follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After
          a few moments, Margaret stops.

          MARGARET
          I'm gonna head back.

          GEOFFREY
          We're not done.

          MARGARET
          I think I am.
          Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her.

          GEOFFREY
          Margaret?
          Margaret stops and turns around.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But
          I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now.
          Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Thank you.

          Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and
          speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still
          painfully awkward.

          Geoffrey speeds up the dance.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Now you.

          MARGARET
          Me what?

          GEOFFREY
          Chant.

          MARGARET
          Chant what?

          GEOFFREY
          Whatever comes out, just chant.   It is the
          way.   You'll feel better.

          MARGARET
          I can't...

          GEOFFREY
          Close your eyes.   Chant.
          Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes,
          but can't figure out what to say.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Chant!

          MARGARET
          I don't know any chants!

          GEOFFREY
          Chant!

          MARGARET

          (GUTTERAL)
          Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
          Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low
          noise.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...

          GEOFFREY
          Chant!
          The drum beat continues.

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          82.
          They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to the wall...
          More sand.   More fire.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to sweat drop down my balls...
          Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say?
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to all these bitches crawl...
          Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken
          out into a âLil John song.   She continues to dance.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...To all skee skee motherfucker...
          Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...all skee skee got damn...
          From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.

          DEBBIE
          Geoffrey!
          Margaret stops chanting âLil John.

          GEOFFREY
          Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything.
          Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Is she singing about balls?

          MARGARET
          He told me I had to chant!

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, you poor dear.   Geoffrey, you can't do
          this!
          (to Margaret)
          He's an eighth Tlingit, dear.

          DEBBIE
          He does this to keep in touch with "his
          people".

          

          

          

          

          83.

          GEOFFREY
          Don't make fun of my heritage!   And it was
          helping.   Don't you feel better?   I feel
          better.

          DEBBIE
          Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned
          up.   You've got a dress to try on.   And
          Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and
          help us with this wedding.
          Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and
          the drum beat stops.

          GEOFFREY
          Fine.
          With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.

          INT. PAXTON MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

          Debbie and Annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master
          bedroom.   They talk to Margaret through the door.

          DEBBIE
          I am so excited.   Aren't you excited?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          This was my dress from 1929.   My mother made
          it by hand.   Amazing how things come back
          into style.   How does it fit?
          Margaret speaks through the door.

          MARGARET (O.S.)
          Just buttoning up here.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Drum roll!
          Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds.
          Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but
          looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except...
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.

          MARGARET
          Yeah, it's a little snug.

          DEBBIE
          Come over here.
          Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror.   Grandma Annie follows.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          MARGARET

          (ADMITTING)
          It's a lovely dress.
          Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying.

          DEBBIE
          (through the tears)
          You're so beautiful, and such a great match
          for my Richard.   I know I've just met you,
          but a mother can tell.   When he looks at
          you, I can tell he's in love.   I'm so happy
          I get to share your day.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Debbie, please.   We've got work to do.

          DEBBIE
          You're right.
          Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          You go work downstairs, I'll finish this.
          Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Go!
          Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in
          tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Had to get rid of her before I gave you
          this.   Don't think she woulda recovered.
          Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around
          Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays
          on Margaret's neck.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          You needed something blue.   It's silly, but
          I didn't want to take any chances.

          MARGARET
          It's beautiful.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue
          ones like this are very rare.   My great
          grandfather gave it to my great grandmother
          when they were married.   They were quite a
          scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she
          was Tlingit.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          85.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Back then, you had to get approval from
          every person in the tribe before you got
          married.   It almost broke them up.

          MARGARET
          How'd they stay together?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Don't know.   But I'm sure happy they did,
          none of us would be here if they hadn't.
          Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          I want you to have it.
          This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing
          from Annie.

          MARGARET
          No, no, no.   I can't.   Really.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          I don't want to hear it.   It's yours.
          Grandmothers like to give their stuff away
          to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like
          we'll always be a part of your life, even
          after we're gone. Take it.
          Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time
          feels like a complete and total fraud.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Are you feeling all right, dear?
          Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.

          MARGARET
          Well.   Thing is...
          Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...the dress is just a little tight.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these
          seams by the arm, this'll be easy.
          Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          We can fix this no problem.
          Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.   He's still in
          a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic.

          MARGARET
          We need to talk.

          RICHARD
          I'm a little busy.

          MARGARET
          Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away
          from here.   From everyone.   Now.

          RICHARD
          Go for another run.

          MARGARET
          No!   I did that.   It did not help.

          RICHARD
          I'm a little tired of you making demands and
          me just jumping...

          MARGARET
          (re: wedding stuff)
          We're not going to need any of this if I
          don't get out of here.

          RICHARD
          OK, high maintenance.   Let's go.

          EXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAY

          Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and
          maneuverability. Richard starts her up.

          MARGARET
          Move over, I'm driving.
          Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.

          RICHARD
          You don't know where we're going.
          Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.

          MARGARET
          It doesn't matter.

          ON THE OPEN OCEAN
          Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the
          horizon.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,
          blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the
          coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it
          doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.
          Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep
          mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an
          icy beach can be seen straight ahead.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Where are we?

          RICHARD
          The north pole.   Congratulations, we made
          it.
          (off Margaret's look)
          It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better
          let me take it from here.

          MARGARET
          I'm fine.

          RICHARD
          Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot
          of glacier fields?   And not died?
          Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Lady, you've got issues.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine.

          RICHARD
          It doesn't stop there.

          MARGARET
          This coming from the sociopath.

          RICHARD
          Oh, please.

          MARGARET
          I'd never bring me here.

          RICHARD
          You drove!

          MARGARET
          I mean to Alaska.

          RICHARD
          Are you kidding me?
          Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          MARGARET
          You're sick.   Doing this to them.

          RICHARD
          I explained to you...

          MARGARET
          They love you.   Do you get that?

          RICHARD
          Of course.

          MARGARET
          And you're still willing to lie to them?

          RICHARD
          Like you didn't know.

          MARGARET
          Didn't know what?

          RICHARD
          That we were going to lie to them.

          MARGARET
          I didn't know!

          RICHARD
          Well that makes you either stupid, or
          ignorant.

          MARGARET
          You think I'm stupid?

          RICHARD
          No, but what's behind door number two...

          MARGARET

          (SCREAMS)
          I forgot!   OK?   I forgot!

          RICHARD
          Forgot what?

          MARGARET
          What it was like!

          RICHARD
          What what was like?

          MARGARET
          To have a family!   I forgot what it was like
          to have a family.   I've been on my own since
          I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was
          like to have people that love you, and make
          you breakfast, and give you necklaces...

          

          

          

          

          89.
          Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of
          breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to take a walk.

          RICHARD
          We need to head back...

          MARGARET
          Alone.   I need alone time.

          RICHARD
          What?
          Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.

          MARGARET
          I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time.
          I need a second.

          RICHARD
          But...

          MARGARET

          (PANICKED)
          Stop right there!
          Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to be over there.   Away from you.
          Just sit down, turn around, and act like
          you're not here.
          Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
          and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks
          away from him on the glacier.

          ON THE GLACIER
          Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (manic, to herself)
          You can do this.   Couple more hours, and
          then you'll never see these people again.
          Eventually you'll write a letter.
          Apologize.   Send the necklace back.

          RICHARD
          (from the boat)
          Margaret!

          MARGARET
          No talking!

          

          

          

          

          90.

          RICHARD
          (from the boat)
          Watch your step, OK?   It can be dangerous.

          MARGARET
          Again, you're not supposed to be...
          Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.

          ON THE BOAT
          Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
          reply.   He doesn't hear anything.   That's weird.

          RICHARD
          (back still turned)
          Margaret?
          Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.   He doesn't see her.
          He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the
          direction he last saw Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Margaret?   I know I'm breaking "the rules"
          here, but where are you?
          He takes one more step before he hears...

          MARGARET (O.S.)

          (YELLING)
          Richard!!!!!!!!   Help!!!!!!!!
          Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her
          voice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --
          Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out
          of the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and
          she's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, thank God!
          Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
          Margaret is really scared.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   Just relax.   I'll
          get you out of there.   You've broken through
          an ice bridge.   It happens all the time.   No
          biggie.

          MARGARET
          Don't do that.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          RICHARD
          Don't do what?

          MARGARET
          The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they
          tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to
          death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do
          that!

          RICHARD
          It's not like that.   Really.   We do need to
          be careful here though, I don't want us both
          to fall in.   Stay still, OK?

          MARGARET
          Uh-huh.
          Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the
          ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.

          RICHARD
          So, I'm going to walk up to you and very
          slowly pull you out.   OK?

          MARGARET
          I'm really cold.

          RICHARD
          Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded
          by ice.

          MARGARET
          (makes sense)

          OK.
          Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
          his knee.   He calmly looks down on her.

          RICHARD
          So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.
          I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't
          freak out.
          Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly
          lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          When I get you all the way out, I need you
          to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you
          over there.
          Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's
          strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over
          the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks
          once they're safe.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've, uh, never done that before.

          MARGARET
          You said it was "no biggie".

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   Well.   You OK?

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I'm fine.
          Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back.
          Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits
          just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (SMILING)
          You shouldn't of laughed at me.

          RICHARD
          You woulda laughed at me.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   While I was getting my camera.
          The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark.
          They might kiss.

          RICHARD
          Gertrude wants me back.
          Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down.

          MARGARET
          And?

          RICHARD
          Well.   It seemed like you were having...
          second thoughts.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I was.

          RICHARD
          Maybe we should do it.   Come clean.

          MARGARET
          Put me down.
          Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain
          her composure.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You wanna call it off?

          

          

          

          

          93.

          RICHARD
          If you do.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we
          get back.

          ON THE BOAT
          Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
          Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
          them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
          married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
          hurry.   He's clearly been waiting.

          GEOFFREY
          Come with me.

          RICHARD
          Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk.

          GEOFFREY
          Not now.   C'mon.
          Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
          Geoffrey storms off and they follow.

          EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY

          Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the
          guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in.

          GEOFFREY
          (to Richard)
          I haven't told your mother about any of
          this, and I don't plan to.
          (to Margaret)
          I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry
          about this.
          Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.

          INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE
          The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.   In the
          middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding
          chair.   It's Gilbertson.   He smiles.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Hey there kids.   Good to see ya!

          

          

          

          

          94.

          RICHARD
          (to Dad)
          What did you do?
          Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (getting angry)
          What did you do, dad?!

          GEOFFREY
          I called him yesterday.   He told me that you
          were lying, and that he was going to catch
          you.   That he was going to send you to
          prison.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (to Richard)
          We made a deal and dad here flew me up.   Now
          you tell the truth, and get off scott free.
          It's like it never happened for you.

          RICHARD
          You made a deal with him?   On my behalf?

          GEOFFREY
          You were making a mistake...

          RICHARD
          That's none of your business.

          MARGARET
          It's fine.

          RICHARD
          The hell it is.   It is not fine!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Oh quack, quack, quack.   Just tell me what
          really happened, and I'll be on my way.   No
          one gets hurt, we all get what we want.
          Margaret takes Richard's hand.

          MARGARET
          It's OK.   Tell him.

          RICHARD
          (to Geoffrey)
          You do not get to make this decision.   This
          is my decision.
          (to Gilbertson)
          The truth is... I've been working for
          Margaret for three years.   Six months ago we
          started dating.   I recently asked her to
          marry me, and she said yes.   See you both at

          

          

          

          

          95.

          GEOFFREY
          What are you doing, Richard?

          RICHARD
          (grabs Margaret's hand)
          Come on, we gotta get ready.
          Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          The couple walks briskly to the house.

          RICHARD
          What was I thinking?   They act like they're
          nice, but really, they're evil.

          MARGARET
          He's only doing it because he loves you.

          RICHARD
          Are you defending him?   Are you defending
          the king dick?

          MARGARET
          Just stop.   Think about this.

          RICHARD
          Oh, I've thought about it.   And know what I
          think?   I think you saved my life.   Thank
          you, Margaret.   Getting married to you is
          the best thing that's ever happened to me.
          Without this, I might've ended up back here.
          Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.

          DEBBIE
          There you are!   You two almost gave me a
          heart attack.   C'mon, get dressed!

          RICHARD
          Coming mom!
          (to Margaret)
          Time to sack up.
          Richard winks and goes inside.   Margaret follows, not sure.

          THE WEDDING MONTAGE
          -- Chairs are set up outside.
          -- Guests arrive via boat.
          -- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo.   Gertrude
          arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes.   Richard waves hello
          and mouths "Sorry."   He goes back inside.

          

          

          

          

          96.
          -- Geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches TV.   He's not dressed
          for the wedding yet.   Debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror
          as she puts on her ear rings.
          -- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Grandma knocks on the door and comes inside.   We see Margaret
          from head to toe.   The dress, veil and flowers look amazing.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is
          perfect.

          MARGARET
          Matches the shoes.
          Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Those'll be your best friend.   Wedding shoes
          stink.   You ready?

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          With the ocean in the background, 200 GUESTS sit in white chairs.
          Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the
          front row.   He ignores Geoffrey.
          Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
          From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
          begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
          the Gang, Cherish".   Heads turn with the start of the music, to
          see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
          When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.

          MARGARET
          (mouthing to Richard)
          Nice song.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Is that your song, dear?

          MARGARET
          I guess so.
          Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up,
          Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.                      (Yes, the same
          guy from the liquor store and the strip club.)

          RAMONE

          

          

          

          

          97.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's me, Ramone.
          Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.   They
          whisper while they walk up to Ramone.

          RICHARD
          You look gorgeous.

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          You look disgusting.

          RICHARD
          So, is this what you dreamed of when you
          were a little girl?

          MARGARET
          Oh, you bet.
          They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Ramone.

          RAMONE

          (QUIETLY)
          Mi amo.
          (To the crowd)
          We are gathered here today to celebrate one
          of life's greatest moments.   To give
          recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
          unselfish ways...
          Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's
          looking straight ahead, determined to get through this.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...of Richard and Margaret's true love...
          "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the
          audience notices.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...before their family and friends.
          "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
          Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in
          order to keep himself seated.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          For it is family and friends who taught
          Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only
          right that family and friends all celebrate
          that love here today.

          

          

          

          

          98.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          And if there is anyone who has cause why
          this couple should not be united in marriage
          and love, they must speak now or forever
          hold their peace.
          Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.
          Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.
          He's not sure what to do.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          Mi amo, do you have a question?
          We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted
          shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.

          MARGARET
          No.

          RAMONE
          Then why is your hand up?

          MARGARET
          I have something to say.   It's not a
          question though.

          RAMONE
          Can it wait âtil after?

          MARGARET
          Uh.   Um.   No.

          RICHARD
          What are you doing?
          Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They
          stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.

          MARGARET
          Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out.
          I've got a little announcement to make about
          the "wedding."

          RICHARD
          Don't do this.
          Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.

          MARGARET
          Not sure the best way to tell you all this.
          But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is
          all a sham.
          Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I was going to get kicked out of the country
          -- so I told Richard that I would destroy
          his career if he didn't marry me.

          RICHARD
          Now wait...

          MARGARET
          Richard.   Please.   Let me finish.
          (to the Paxton family)
          Richard wanted to stop this when we got off
          the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't
          blame him.   This is all my fault.
          (to Ramone)
          Could you get the band started?   And give
          these people something to drink.
          (to Gilbertson)
          And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten,
          you're taking me to the airport.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You got it!
          Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
          back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets
          to Gertrude and leans down.

          MARGARET
          Take care of him.

          GERTRUDE
          Promise.
          Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed.   Her bag is
          packed.   Richard knocks and comes in.   Margaret is on the phone.

          MARGARET
          (unenthusiastically to phone)
          Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good
          news.   Talk to you on Monday.
          Margaret hangs up.

          RICHARD
          So Frank's back in?
          Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity
          tour doesn't mean much right now.

          MARGARET
          Yup.   He's in.   For now.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          RICHARD
          Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird?

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   Right.
          Margaret starts collecting her bags.

          RICHARD
          Great exit back there.

          MARGARET
          Thanks.   Fun weekend.

          RICHARD
          Same old, same old, around here.

          MARGARET
          Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to
          strip the sheets, so I just left them.

          RICHARD
          I'll let her know.

          (BEAT)
          Why did you tell them all that?

          MARGARET
          It was getting too messy.   We weren't going
          to be able to keep it up.

          RICHARD
          Don't start lying to me now.
          Margaret stops for a moment.

          MARGARET
          I heard you and Gertrude at the school.   I
          think she meant what she said.   She's a
          great girl, you should stay.   It's the right
          thing.   You're perfect for each other.

          RICHARD
          But... but what about you?   What are you
          gonna do?
          Margaret wants to keep the conversation short.

          MARGARET
          Don't worry about me.   I'll survive.

          RICHARD
          So what?   This is it?

          MARGARET
          Yup.   This is it.

          

          

          

          

          101.
          Margaret walks to the door, but stops.   She turns to Richard.
          Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (SINCERE)
          Have an amazing life, OK?   You're a good
          person.   You deserve it.
          She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it.   It's electric, but
          Margaret denies it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Goodbye, Richard.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase.   She can
          hear that the party is in full swing and smiles.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY

          Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her
          suitcase tight.   It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud.
          The two have to yell to talk.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I want you to say the words.

          MARGARET
          I'm not doing great in the dignity
          department, can we not do this right now?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Say it.
          Margaret closes her eyes.   Hating that it's come to this.

          MARGARET
          I'll publish your book.
          Gilbertson smiles.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Now was that so hard?

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore.
          Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers.

          GERTRUDE
          So here's the deal.   I'm going to have a
          million questions for you tomorrow...
          Gertrude sits down next to Richard.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here
          and drink beer.   OK?
          Richard nods.   Gertrude hands him a beer.

          RICHARD
          Thanks.
          Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek.   Then, realizing
          where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to
          Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the
          lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.
          When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.
          Richard looks worried.   Something is wrong.

          GERTRUDE
          You have been practicing.

          RICHARD
          Waddya mean?

          GERTRUDE
          Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned
          into bit of a man whore down there.
          Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.   Gertrude makes light.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          You're gonna have to put that in check if
          you move back.   Cause me and Beth Cable are
          the only two real options up here... and
          I'll kick that bitch's ass.
          Richard gives her a polite smile.   He's not really in the mood to
          joke.   Gertrude notices.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          So no jokes yet?   Too soon?

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry.   I'm just a little... confused.

          GERTRUDE
          That kiss didn't seem "confused."
          Richard takes a beat to collect himself.

          RICHARD
          You're amazing, Gert.   And I've thought
          about being with you for a long time.   A
          long time.   When you said those things at
          the school?   I've dreamed about hearing you
          say those things.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          103.
          RICHARD                                                         (cont'd)
          But as crazy as this seems.   I know now...
          that we're just not meant to be.
          Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret?
          I felt sick.   For the three years we worked
          together, I wanted to be as far away from
          her as possible.   But now that she's gone?
          I'm just really... sad.   I want her with me.
          What is that?
          The question hangs in the air.

          GERTRUDE
          I don't know.

          RICHARD
          I think I have to find out.

          GERTRUDE
          Find out what?

          RICHARD
          If she feels the same way.
          Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.

          GERTRUDE
          Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do?
          (voice cracking)
          I guess you want who you want.
          Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.

          RICHARD
          I'm so sorry.

          (BEAT)
          But, I gotta go.

          GERTRUDE
          Uh-huh.
          Richard gets up.

          RICHARD
          Are you OK?

          GERTRUDE
          I'm fine.   Really.   Go.
          Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party.

          

          

          

          

          104.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - PARTY - DAY

          Debbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar,
          dumbstruck looks on their faces.   Ramone mixes drinks and flips
          bottles.   Richard runs up to them all, looking excited.

          GEOFFREY
          What are you so God damn happy about?

          RICHARD
          What?   Oh.   Well, I'm, uh, going to see
          Margaret.

          GEOFFREY
          What?!

          DEBBIE
          She violated you.   We should report her.

          RICHARD
          Who you gonna report her to, mom?

          DEBBIE
          Oh my God.   He's got the Stockholm syndrome.

          RICHARD
          I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.   And
          she didn't violate me.

          DEBBIE
          What is going on, Richard?
          Richard slows down and explains to his mom.

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry I lied to you.   That was an awful
          thing to do.   But it took this weekend for
          me to see how funny, and screwed up and
          perfect Margaret is for me.   I think
          she's... the one.

          DEBBIE
          But you already thought she was the one.

          RICHARD
          No, I didn't.   Not until she left.

          DEBBIE
          Really?   Does she think that too?

          RICHARD
          I don't know.   I've got to get to the
          airport to find out.
          Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          DEBBIE
          (so romantic)
          He's going to stop her from leaving!   At the
          airport!

          RICHARD
          But I gotta hurry.   Her plane leaves any
          second.   I might not make it.

          DEBBIE
          (so romantic)
          He's not sure he's going to make it!

          GEOFFREY
          Are you buying this horse shit?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, Geoffrey!

          RICHARD
          I don't have time to explain this to you.

          GEOFFREY
          Well then make some god-damn time.   Cause I
          won't let you throw your life away for some
          woman.

          RICHARD
          I don't care.

          GEOFFREY
          Excuse me?

          RICHARD
          I don't care.   I love you and want you to
          understand.   But I'm not asking your
          permission here.   I'm doing this.

          GEOFFREY
          Oh, really?
          From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts.

          ANNIE
          Boys!   Stop it! Stop it!   Stop it!
          But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face.   She
          grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth,
          causing a loud crash.   Geoffrey and Richard run over.

          GEOFFREY
          Mom, are you OK?

          ANNIE
          I'm having a... I need to go to the
          hospital.   Fast.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Margaret and Gilbertson board the jet together.   Margaret finds
          her seat in first class and discovers the Handsome Man from the
          flight before sitting nearby.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (re: Gilbertson)
          Is this another gay assistant?
          Margaret doesn't say anything and takes her seat.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          TWO COAST GUARDSMAN carry Annie on a gurney to their waiting
          helicopter.   Geoffrey, Richard, and Debbie follow behind.   They
          all pile into a large chopper and fly off.

          INT. COAST GUARD HELICOPTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          An oxygen mask covers Annie's face.   Geoffrey holds her hand.
          Annie motions for Geoffrey to come closer and he leans down.
          Geoffrey sits up and shouts over the helicopter noise.

          GEOFFREY
          Richard!   She has something she wants to say
          to us!
          Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie.   Their three
          heads are very close together.   Annie speaks to them both through
          the oxygen mask.

          ANNIE
          Listen to me.   You two need to stop
          fighting.   You'll never see eye to eye, but
          you're family.   If this doesn't stop, one
          day you'll regret it.
          (to Geoffrey)
          Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if
          you don't agree with him.

          GEOFFREY
          I... I promise.

          ANNIE
          And Richard.   Promise you'll work harder to
          be a part of this family.

          RICHARD
          I promise, Grandma.

          ANNIE
          OK, then.
          Annie closes her eyes.   She looks peaceful.   A moment passes.

          

          

          

          

          107.
          Then suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th
          pilot.
          ANNIE (cont'd)
          (as if nothing happened)
          I'm feeling much better.   I don't need to go
          to the hospital.   Take us to the airport,
          please.
          Richard and Geoffrey are confused.   Stunned even.

          GEOFFREY
          What... what is going on?
          (so the Coast Guard can't hear)
          Did you fake a heart attack?

          ANNIE
          We didn't have time for your squabbling, and
          I knew a helicopter would be the quickest
          way to the airport.   It seemed like the best
          way.

          RICHARD
          The best way?

          ANNIE
          And remember, you two promised me that
          you're going get along.   I wasn't kidding
          about that.

          COAST GUARD PILOT
          Ma'am, I'm not authorized to take you to the
          airport...

          ANNIE
          (to pilot)
          Larry Ferris!   Don't make me call your
          mother!

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Gilbertson talks non-stop.   Margaret is in hell.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...I want my book launch to be special.   I'm
          thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky
          Monastery.   In St. Petersberg?
          Margaret stares at him blankly.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          (as if she should know)
          Where Dostoyevsky is buried?   Hello?   I
          thought you were a professional...
          Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain.

          

          

          

          

          108.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY

          The helicopter lands, and Richard jumps out.   His family follows
          as they run to the control tower.

          INT. AIRPORT TOWER - DAY

          CHUCK has an easy job.   Jets fly into Sitka, but there are only
          about six flights a day.   He is half awake as he radios
          Margaret's flight.   Reggae music plays in the background.

          CHUCK
          Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff.

          PILOT (O.S.)
          Roger that, Chuck.
          The PHONE RINGS in the tower.   Chuck picks up.   Intercut as
          necessary, with Richard running on a cell phone.

          CHUCK
          Tower.   Talk to me.

          RICHARD
          Hey Chuck, it's Richard.

          CHUCK
          Hey man.   Heard about your lady bailing.
          How often does this happen to you?

          RICHARD
          Need you to do me a solid, brother.   I gotta
          see my girl and she's on that flight.   Could
          you stop it for me?

          CHUCK
          No can do brohan.   Need a good reason for
          the FAA holes.   Lose my jobby job if I
          delivered that favor.

          RICHARD
          Oh, c'mon Chuck!

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          The plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff.   Margaret
          studies the safety pamphlet, trying to ignore Gilbertson.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...so next topic.   Celebrities.   Let's
          invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the
          Paris Hilton's, OK?
          Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane
          leave Sitka.

          

          

          

          

          109.

          EXT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family stand outside the tower and watch
          Margaret's plane take off.

          RICHARD
          Well.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New
          York, it'll be like this never happened.
          Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
          takes a deep breath.

          GEOFFREY
          So, you know I think you shouldn't be with
          Margaret, right?

          RICHARD
          You've made that crystal clear.

          GEOFFREY
          Good.
          (looks at Annie)
          Well, consider this me keeping my promise.
          Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits
          for an answer.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          (to phone)
          Hey!   Maguire!   Yeah, yeah, yeah, her
          running out was something.   But that's what
          I'm calling about.   I've got a favor to ask
          you, âbout one of your planes...

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Gilbertson continues to talk.   Margaret is in a stupor.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...you know those two hundred pages I took
          out?   I'm going to put them back...
          A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Ms. Mills?   Would you come with me?
          Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson.

          MARGARET
          Yes, of course.
          She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          What's this about?

          

          

          

          

          110.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          (never done this before)
          There's someone on the radio for you.
          The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at
          the front of the plane, outside the cockpit.
          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd)
          Uh, a Richard Paxton?
          Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt.

          MARGARET
          Tell him I'm not here.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower.
          Chuck sits nearby.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
          (from radio)
          I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you.

          RICHARD
          Shit!   She's never going to pick up...

          CHUCK
          (to Richard)
          Know what, home slice?   Cut this chica
          loose.   You remember Beth Cable?   She'd
          totally be into you...
          Suddenly, Richard has an idea.   He picks up the hand mic.

          RICHARD
          Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you
          ask the captain to do me one more favor...

          CUT TO:

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          DING!   The captain comes on over the loudspeaker.

          CAPTAIN
          (over plane loudspeaker)
          Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is
          your captain.   We've reached our cruising
          altitude of 30,000 feet.   Flight time'll   be
          three hours and thirty minutes.   And
          Margaret?   Richard has something he'd like
          to say to you.

          

          

          

          

          111.

          RICHARD (O.S.)
          (over loudspeaker)
          Uh, hey Margaret.   And cause I'm on the
          loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane.
          The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's
          Margaret.   Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she
          doesn't know either.
          RICHARD (O.S.) (cont'd)
          (over loudspeaker)
          This certainly isn't how I wanted to do
          this.   I mean, I'm not really into the whole
          baring your soul in front of strangers
          thing, but I figure it's now or never.   So
          here goes.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure.
          His family encourages him on.

          CHUCK
          You're doing great, man.
          Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike.

          RICHARD
          I know you're used to being on your own.
          And that you're comfortable with your life
          the way it is.   And that in a million years
          you wouldn't have thought that we should be
          together.   I know, because I felt the exact
          same way.

          CUT TO:

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Every passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the
          loudspeaker.   The flight attendants, the Handsome Man, everyone.

          RICHARD (O.S.)
          (over loudspeaker)
          And you know what else I know?   I know that
          I'm tired of being alone.   And I think
          you're tired of being alone too.   So come
          on.   Talk to me.   Please.
          The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (with genuine concern)
          Do you really feel like you're alone?

          

          

          

          

          112.

          MARGARET
          Oh, good lord.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family stare at the radio, waiting to see if
          there is going to be an answer.   Chuck crosses his fingers.

          MARGARET (O.S.)
          (from radio)
          What the hell are you doing?
          Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress.

          RICHARD
          We need to talk.
          (Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the
          plane with the passengers watching.)

          MARGARET
          About what?

          RICHARD
          Have you ever thought there might be a
          reason we've been together for the last
          three years?

          MARGARET
          As boss and assistant.

          RICHARD
          Things change, Margaret.

          MARGARET

          (INCREDULOUS)
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Yeah, things change.

          MARGARET
          Is that the best you got?
          Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what I said."
          Richard composes himself.

          RICHARD
          Now, tell me the truth.   When you left, were
          you relieved or sad that we didn't have an
          excuse to be together anymore?
          Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one.

          

          

          

          

          113.

          MARGARET
          What's your point?

          RICHARD
          Because I am sick that you left.   And if you
          feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be
          together?
          Margaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants
          to go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it.
          Gilbertson panics.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Are you thinking about going back to him?
          Margaret doesn't answer.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          We have a deal!   You can't back out now!
          The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying
          to break up Richard and Margaret.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, you need to sit down.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I will do no such thing.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your
          seat.
          Other passengers yell "sit down asshole" at Gilbertson.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Who said that?

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, this is your third and final warning!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Listen sweetheart...
          (he pokes the flight attendant)
          I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get
          me another cocktail and mind your own...
          BUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through
          Gilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor.
          Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And
          you're under arrest for disobeying a crew
          member, assault, and possible intoxication.

          

          

          

          

          114.
          The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around
          Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then
          takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need
          to get this unruly passenger off the plane
          ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if
          it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain
          turn this bird around.
          There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          (winks at Margaret)
          Told you I was a romantic.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY

          Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing.   Richard and his family
          wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them.   A truck drives
          stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens.
          Margaret steps out.   Richard walks up the steps.

          MARGARET
          This wasn't supposed to happen.
          Richard looks Margaret in the eye.

          RICHARD
          But it did.
          Margaret looks down.   A little embarrassed.

          MARGARET
          I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.
          Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and
          plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.
          The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Uh, sorry, but excuse us.
          The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
          down the steps.

          MARGARET
          (to Gilbertson)
          Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might
          affect you at work?
          Gilbertson has no retort.

          

          

          

          

          115.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish
          your book after all.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          So you are getting married this weekend?

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          Absolutely not.   But who knows?
          (looking at Richard)
          We might by the time you get out of jail.
          Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off.
          Margaret turns back to Richard.   All smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I've got some explaining to do.
          Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of
          Richard's family.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Debbie)
          Hi.   I'm Margaret.   I've known your son for
          years, but we've just recently begun to see
          each other romantically.
          (to Geoffrey)
          I want to get to know you all, and spend
          some real time up here in Alaska.
          (to Annie)
          I'm not sure when you are going to see him
          get married, but I promise as long as I'm
          with him, he'll be happy.
          Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          That's all we ever wanted.
          Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins
          in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. PAXTON ISLAND - DANCEFLOOR - DAY

          The party is in full swing.
          Balzac chases his balls.
          Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band.   He has a
          beautiful voice.
          Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug.   They've done this before.

          

          

          

          

          116.
          Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table.   The
          Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink.   Grandma Annie winks and
          leaves these two alone.
          Margaret and Richard dance.   All smiles, even though they aren't
          very good.
          And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
          island, to an eagle's nest at the very top.   Inside the nest,
          three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's
          phone.

INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING

CAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind
a desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN (Adam Sandler)

                         BARRY
            ...yes I'm still on hold...

                         OPERATOR
            And what was this?

                         BARRY
            I'm looking at your advertisement
            for the airline promotion and
            giveaway?

                         OPERATOR
            This is "Fly With Us?"

                         BARRY
            It's hard to understand because it
            says in addition to but I can't
            exactly understand in addition to
            what because there's actually
            nothing to add it too...

                         OPERATOR
            I think that's a type-o then, that
            would be a mistake.

                         BARRY
            So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten
            purchases of any of your Healthy
            Choice products equals five hundred
            miles and then with the coupon the
            same purchases would value one
            thousand miles --

                         OPERATOR
            That's it.

                         BARRY
            Do you realize that the monetary
            value of this promotion and the
            prize is potentially worth more
            than the purchases?

                         OPERATOR
            I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,
DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,
gets distracted, then back to the phone call;

                         BARRY
            Can I call you back if I have any
            further questions...? Can I get
            your extension?

                         OPERATOR
            It's extension 215 if you want to
            try me back.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's
fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products
seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key
chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT
THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him
out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks
down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,
shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto
mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at
the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up
landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies
past very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting
alone in the middle of the street.

He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside
his warehouse.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

Barry on the phone again;

                         BARRY
            ....I'm not exactly sure what that
            means...

                         VOICE
            If they break or something. What is
            it, plastic?

                         BARRY
            It's a plastic, yeah.

                         VOICE
            Right. Alright, lemme call you
            first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run
            the numbers, see what's what and
            I'll give you a call back --

                         BARRY
            Did you have my home phone number?

                         VOICE
            For what?

                         BARRY
            If you wanted to call me back I
            could...

                         VOICE
            I'm fine, I have your work number.

                         BARRY
            Ok...because of the time difference
            if you needed to call me early?

                         VOICE
            It's fine. I can just get you at
            your office.

                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         VOICE
            Ok, bye, bye.

                         BARRY
            Bye.

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him
again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks
down the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the
Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD
(Emily Watson) exits the car and starts to walk down the
length of the alley towards him.....CAMERA stays over his
shoulder and turns into a profile 2-shot;

                         LENA
            Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         LENA
            They're not open yet?

                         BARRY
            They don't get opened until eight.

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.

                         LENA
            Is it ok if I leave my car you think?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            I thought they opened at seven.
                   (beat)
            If I left my car would it be ok?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Do you know them.

                         BARRY
            Not very well.

                         LENA
            Can I ask you, can I trust to leave
            my keys with you and give them to
            you so that when they get here you
            could give them to them?
                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         LENA
            You think it's ok where I left it,
            right there?

                         BARRY
            I think that'll be fine.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:

                         LENA
            There's a piano in the street.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank
            you for your help.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

                         LENA
            Maybe I'll see you later, when I
            pick up my car?

                         BARRY
            Ok.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,
hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the
end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her
shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks
off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks
around some more....then he makes the long walk down the
street.

ON THE STREET.
Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He
tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and
a small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and
holds the note.....

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his
office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps
the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then
stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note
melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who
enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;

                         LANCE
            Hey, good morning, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Hey...Lance....can I.....

                         LANCE
            You ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine.

                         LANCE
            Why you wearin' a suit?

                         BARRY
            Um....I bought one. I thought maybe
            it would be nice to get dressed for
            work, can I show you something?

                         LANCE
            Yeah.....you got here early huh?

                         BARRY
            ....yes.....

They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium;

                         LANCE
            What is this?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. I think it's a
            piano....a small piano.

                         LANCE
            That's not a piano.....I have a
            piano at home.....where'd you get it?

Lance walks around behind the harmonium....leaving Barry
alone....towards the warehouse......he starts to back up a
little.....

                         BARRY
            Well.....it was dropped on the
            street.....

Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind
Barry.....he sees them: CAMERA pushes in on Barry....

                         LANCE (OC)
            Why is it here? Barry....Barry?

                         BARRY
            ...it just....I don't know....I
            don't know.

INT. WAREHOUSE/MAIN AREA - DAY

CAMERA pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to TWO
CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front
of them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;

                         CUSTOMER
            You do guaranteed sale? etc.

                         BARRY
            We back our plungers 100% and we do
            ask for a 30 to 60 day display on
            the floor.....

In the b.g., RICO over the laud speaker says:

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister's on line one.

Barry doesn't move....

                         BARRY
            Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60
            days....

                         CUSTOMER
            I think you have a call?

Rico turns around, without loudspeaker;

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

They look at him a moment....

                         BARRY
            I'm just gonna grab this call real
            quick?

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby
at Rico's station;

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            .....This is Barry.

                         RHONDA
            Hey it's me, it's Rhonda. Are you
            coming to the party tonight?

                         BARRY
            Hi, Rhonda, yes I am.

                         RHONDA
            Bye.

She hangs up.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Yes I'll see you tonight.

Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that: One thing I
            wanted to point out, Dave, is that
            we've just received a large order
            from the Rio Hotel and Casino in
            Las Vegas where we're going to be
            supplying their hotel rooms with
            the dice and money plunger, so
            these babies are really moving well
            right now...

                         RICO

            Barry, your sister's on line two.

Barry tries again to ignore it....

                         BARRY
            With the Aqua Blast Whales and
            Speed Boats we're gonna ask for a
            display at eye level for the little
            kids.....

Barry walks back to the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         KAREN
            Hey it's me, what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            Hello, Karen. I'm just working.

                         KAREN
            Yeah but what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            I'm just working....I have some
            customers here.....

                         KAREN
            So you can't talk to me?

                         BARRY
            I have a few people here, I can't
            really chat right now.

                         KAREN
            "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"

                         BARRY
            Well, I can't talk though --

                         KAREN
            You just fucking said "chat," that
            is so -- what are you now? "chat."
            I'm just calling to make sure you
            show up at this party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Yes, I'll be there.

                         KAREN
            Fine. You get back to chatting with
            your precious customers.

                         BARRY
            Ok, bye-bye.

Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence
and walks back to the customers and says:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that.

                         CUSTOMER
            I didn't know you had a sister?

                         BARRY
            .....Well yes I do....
                   (beat)
            But one more thing I wanted to tell
            you guys about the new plungers is
            that we're making the handles now
            in a non-breakable material
            called.....

He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on
the table....it SMASHES and rice falls out everywhere....

                         BARRY
            Ok...this is one of the old ones, I
            think. Lance do we have any new
            plungers around?

Lance moves to get a new plunger....

                         BARRY
            That was a little embarrassing and
            that was one of the old handles so
            let me get a new one to show you --

                         RICO
                   (loudspeaker)
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

Barry holds, then;

                         CUSTOMER
            How many sisters do you have?

                         BARRY
            ....I have seven.

                         CUSTOMER #2
            Holy shit. You have seven sisters?

                         BARRY
            They're calling because we're
            having a party tonight for my
            sister and the they're just
            calling....can you hang on for just
            two more minutes....?

Barry walks this time into his office......CAMERA tracks
with Barry to his office, seeing him try and shake this
off.....He EXITS FRAME.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

Barry enters, takes a quick moment to size up the
harmonium.....He picks up the phone and through the
conversation gently moves the harmonium to a different spot
on the desk;

A mechanic passes by at this moment, keeps walking past;

            What's wrong with her car?

                         MECHANIC

            Hey, how are you?

            I'm fine, hi, how are you?

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm just stopping by to say hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello.

                         ELIZABETH
            So you're coming tonight, right?

                         BARRY
            Yes, indeed, yes I am.

                         ELIZABETH
            There's this girl, this friend of
            mine from work that I think is
            really cute and really cool and I
            want you to meet her so I was
            thinking about bringing her to the
            party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            Well I don't want to do something
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's my friend and you should meet
            her. You'd like her.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but please don't do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not really asking you, I'm
            telling you.

                         BARRY
            Yeah but please don't do that:
            everyone would be looking at me.

                         ELIZABETH
            It's a free country, we can look at
            you if we want to.

                         BARRY
            Yes but I get tense and I feel like
            I can't be myself if that happens.

                         ELIZABETH
            That's your fault not mine.

                         BARRY
            I don't think I'm going to the party.

                         ELIZABETH
            So it's ok if I bring her.

                         BARRY
            Please don't.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's really cute and she's really
            nice.

            ...please, I just don't want it....

                         ELIZABETH
            ....wait a minute: why is this
            about you now? Why is it always
            about you?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to be your friend.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

                         BARRY
            Well, yeah, thank you, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- but since you're not going I
            guess none of this matters and I'll
            bring her anyway.

BEAT. HOLD. She stares him down.

                         ELIZABETH
            All I'm trying to do is be your
            friend.

Barry apologizes....the KID just takes off....Barry's cart
now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy....

ANGLE, FROZEN FOOD AISLE.
CAMERA tracks left to right with Barry as he heads for the
Healthy Choice Frozen Dinner. He grabs one.

CU. BARRY. LOW ANGLE.
He looks at box.

BARRY'S POV - THE BOX
Slow zoom in. The sticker reads: "Fly Away With Us! The More
You Buy The More You Earn."

ANGLE, SOUP SECTION.
CAMERA tracks along right to left with Barry as he moves
towards some SOUP. He grabs one, inspects it.....then puts
it back.

CU. SOUP CAN.
It's put back on the shelf: TILT down to price: 79 cents.

Barry turns his cart around and SMACKS right into someone
else again, screwing up another wheel on his cart.

ANGLE, BARRY.
CAMERA, tracks alongside him, left to right as he comes
across: PUDDING. The price: 4/$1.00.

MED. BARRY in the middle of the aisle.
He reacts......smiles...holds....thinks....looks around,
then starts to load up on the pudding.

ANGLE, BARRY.
He pushes TWO SHOPPING CARTS FULL OF PUDDING over to the
STORE MANAGER who's on his knees, stacking milk.....Barry
kneels down, CAMERA PUSHES INTO A CU. as he speaks sotto;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello, sir. My name is Barry Egan
            and I'd like to ask if you have any
            more Healthy Choice pudding in the
            back?

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens slowly and Barry peers his head around and
into the house very cautiously, CAMERA PUSHES IN and PANS
slightly LEFT to reveal: THE KITCHEN.

Barry's SEVEN SISTERS are all there, preparing dinner and
talking away....they turn and see him;

                         SUSAN
            There he is! Do you remember when
            we used to call you gay and you'd
            get all mad?

                         KATHLEEN
            -- we were calling you gay and you
            got so mad that you threw a hammer
            through the sliding glass door --
            do you remember?

                         BARRY
            I don't really remember that.

                         KATHLEEN
            Yes you do. We were calling you Gay
            Boy and you got so mad....

                         BARRY
            Yes, yes, right.

                         SUSAN
            We're trying to remember why you
            had the hammer in the first place?

                         BARRY
            ...um.....

                         KATHLEEN
            The hammer that you threw....why
            did you have it?

                         SUSAN
            You don't remember -- you had the
            hammer and you threw it -- ?

                         BARRY
            I remember, yes.....

                         SUSAN
            Why did you have it?

Another sister, RHONDA, enters from behind, Barry jumps, says:

                         RHONDA
            He was building a ramp for the dog.

                         KATHLEEN
            He was making a ramp for the dog!
            That's right!

                         SUSAN
            That's right....ramp for the
            dog..... And you just threw the
            hammer.

                         BARRY
                   (to Rhonda)
            Happy Birthday, Rhonda.

                         RHONDA
            Thank you. Thank you so much, Barry.

She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake
next to a bigger, cooler looking cake.

Mia approaches holding a baby.....Barry tries to say hello
to the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's
grasp....making herself the center of his attention;

KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, THAT MOMENT

Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the
baby...and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining
room, revealing himself to: ELIZABETH, KAREN, NICOLE AND
ANNA. There are also: THREE BROTHER IN LAW'S (WALTER, LARRY
AND STEVE)

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey....I was just telling everyone
            about how I was gonna bring this
            girl for you but you wouldn't let
            me do it.

                         BARRY
            Hello everyone.

KAREN steps up and greets him;

                         KAREN
            Did you think that we'd all be
            looking at you?

                         BARRY
            No, no, no.

                         KAREN
            Well it's just not true. We
            wouldn't be looking at you -- why
            are you wearing this suit? Did you
            say hello to your brother in law's?

                         STEVE/LARRY
            Hi, Barry. How ya doin? Good, good.

                         KAREN
            Say hello to them, that's right,
            good, good. Ok. Come on, we're
            gonna eat now.....let's go.....

Barry shakes hands and hello's with the brother in law's.
He's left alone for a moment with Walter and Elizabeth;

                         WALTER
            How you doin' Barry?

                         BARRY
            Hi Walter.

                         WALTER
            How's business?

                         BARRY
            Business is very food, thanks.
                         ELIZABETH
            What's very food?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            You just said very food.

                         BARRY
            Did I say that?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That was weird. I meant good.

                         WALTER
            Maybe you said that because you're
            hungry.....

Walter moves to help everyone...they're moving to set the
table......

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON BARRY AND ELIZABETH alone for a beat:

                         ELIZABETH
            You're lucky. She couldn't come
            anyway --

                         BARRY
            Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.

                         ELIZABETH
            She couldn't come I said. Are you
            nervous?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         ELIZABETH
            You look nervous.

                         BARRY
            I'm not, I'm very happy.

RHONDA passes;

                         RHONDA
            Come on homo-boy, we're eating now.

Elizabeth leaves, HOLD ON BARRY.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TOWARDS EVERYONE SETTING THE
TABLE.....CAMERA ROTATES AROUND.....everyone is still
chatting a bit about "Barry gay boy," and "the girl that was
gonna be here that Barry wouldn't allow."

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry is standing in front of the floor to
ceiling sliding glass doors.....in an INSTANT, he TURNS AND
THROWS HIS FIST STRAIGHT THROUGH THREE OF THEM, THEY
SHATTER....he turns back, they are all staring straight at
him in silence. HOLD, THEN:

In unison they all go ape shit:

                         GROUP
            WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM.
            GODDAMNIT BARRY. YOU FUCKIN' MANIAC.
            ETC. ETC.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

It's later and WALTER and BARRY walk down a small hall and
into a kids room. They're OC for a few moments as the CAMERA
slowly pushes in and towards the room. Following sotto;

                         WALTER
            What's up?

                         BARRY
            Well I'm sorry. Before...

                         WALTER
            Mhm.

                         BARRY
            And I'm sorry that I did that.

                         WALTER
            It's alright.

                         BARRY
            I wanted to ask you because you're
            a doctor, right?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I don't like the way I am sometimes.
                   (beat)
            Can you help me?
                         WALTER
            Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of
            help do you think I can give you?

                         BARRY
            I know that. Maybe you know other
            doctors?

                         WALTER
            Like a psychiatrist?

                         BARRY
            I don't have anyone to talk to
            things about and I understand it's
            confidential with a doctor - I'm
            embarrassed about that and I don't
            want my sisters to know?

                         WALTER
            You want a number for a
            psychiatrist, I can get you one,
            that's not a problem. but what
            exactly is wrong?

                         BARRY
            I don't know if there's anything
            wrong with me because I don't know
            how other people are.....Sometimes
            I cry a lot.....for no reason.

Barry starts to cry. Walter just stares at his. HOLD.

Barry stops, recuperates, then leaves.....as he does;

                         BARRY
            Please don't tell my sisters.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

CU. HEALTHY CHOICE COUPON.
Barry's scissors cut out a coupon and reveal an image
beneath in another section of the newspaper...it's the sexy
LEG of a woman....

the ad...

HOLD ON HIS FACE. He looks....then:

            Can you say that my name is Jack?

                         OPERATOR GIRL (OC)
            You want her to call you Jack?

            No I just....I don't want to, I
            just want to be connected to talk
            to a girl.

                         OPERATOR GIRL (OC)
            It's a call back service -- a girl
            will call you back.

                         BARRY

                         BARRY
            ...just talking to you....

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are your pants off?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah. And looking at myself in the
            mirror. Do you wanna know what I
            look like?

                         BARRY
            It doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            What do you mean it doesn't matter?

                         BARRY
            Well. I have no way of knowing. So
            it doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8,
            blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I
            work out. My pussy's shaved. My
            friends say I'm pretty cute, so....

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         SEXY VOICE
            What do you mean, "really?" Yeah.
            Really. What about you?

                         BARRY
            It doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....you're married aren't you,
            Jack?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You have a girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            ...yes...

                         SEXY VOICE
            Where is she?

                         BARRY
            She's...not here...she went out.
            She went out of town, she travels a
            lot.

Barry holds his head in his hands for minute, then stands
out of it --

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

            I'm horny, Jack, what about you?

            Does Jack like to Jack Off?

                         BARRY

                         SEXY VOICE
            Thank you. What do you do, Barry?

                         BARRY
            I have my own business....I work. I
            work hard at doing my business.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....do you do well, do you make
            alotta money?

                         BARRY
            I do pretty good, I think. I wish I
            was making more, doing a little bit
            better. I can,t get over a certain
            hump. I will...I will crack
            something soon I think and really
            do better...I'd like to
            diversify...but I'm doing great, I
            think, as a start.

                         SEXY VOICE
            So.....are you stroking it, yet,
            honey?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Well why don't you take your pants
            off and stroke it for me?

                         BARRY

INT. BARRY'S BATHROOM/BEDROOM - LATER

It's a little bit later and Barry stands in his bathroom,
washes his face....HOLD....then he dries his face, walks
into his bedroom, gets into bed wearing T-shirt and
underwear.....he crawls in, curls up in fetal position....

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

INT. SAME EXACT ANGLE - MORNING

Sun comes in now. Barry is somehow dressed in a FULL ADIDAS
SWEAT SUIT complete with SNEAKERS. He wakes up, looks down
and sees this, confused;

                         BARRY
            Whassis?

                                            CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barry is dressed for work in another suit now. He grabs some
stuff and heads for the door when the phone rings;

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Hey. What are you doing? How are you?

                         BARRY
            I'm fine. Who is this?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Georgia.

                         BARRY
            Hi....what....what's up....?

                         SEXY VOICE
            It's ok that I'm calling, right, I
            mean? It's ok.

                         BARRY
            Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I just wanted to call and talk to
            you, thank you for last night, try
            and get you before you went to work
            and say, "hey."

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            I'm going to work.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed
            up too late last night, what about
            you, when did you go to sleep?

                         BARRY
            Not very late.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You're going to work now?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Can I ask you a question?

                         BARRY
            Uh-huh.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Remember last night I was talking
            to you and I was telling you about
            my apartment, my rent -- ?
                   (beat)
            Do you remember?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         SEXY VOICE
            This is really weird and really
            embarrassing for me but....uh....
                   (beat)
            I was wondering if you could help
            me out with a little bit of money.

                         BARRY
            Me?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I
            can't afford it.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You don't even know how much it is.

                         BARRY
            I know but I....how much is it?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?

                         BARRY
            Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't
            afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Really? Please?

                         BARRY
            You have trouble, financial trouble?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah. It's so hard these days and I
            really need it.

                         BARRY
            Yes I can't....I don't make enough
            money to be able to do that.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I thought you had your own business.
            You said you were gonna diversify
            and all that stuff....

BEAT. Barry steps back a little....

                         SEXY VOICE
            So you think you can?

                         BARRY
            No. I'm sorry.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Should I call back and talk to your
            girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            ....what....?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I was wondering if it's better to
            ask your girlfriend for the money?
            It could be really easy. I mean, I
            have all your information, credit
            card information and billing stuff --

Barry hangs up the phone real fast. HOLD. He doesn't move.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S WORK/WAREHOUSE - MORNING/LATER

CAMERA (HAND HELD) behind Barry, as he walks through the
warehouse, greets the boys, says hello to Lance, etc. Lance,
taking his cue from Barry, is a bit more dressed up today....

                         LANCE
            Good morning, Barry....

                         BARRY
            Hi, Lance.

                         LANCE
            What's with all this pudding, what
            is this?

CAMERA sees that all the pudding Barry bought has been
stacked neatly in a corner. Barry stops dead in his tracks
to explain;

                         BARRY
            That's part of a very interesting
            airline promotion giveaway that's
            really tremendous. I'm going to
            start a collection of pudding and
            coupons that can be redeemed for
            frequent flyer miles through
            Healthy Choice and American
            Airlines --

                         LANCE
            You're goin' on a trip?

                         BARRY
            No.........but airline miles are
            just like a currency these days.

                         LANCE
            You should go on a trip.

                         BARRY
            No thanks.

                         LANCE
            So what should I do with the pudding?

                         BARRY
            Let's just leave it there for now.

Barry goes into his office and looks at the Harmonium. BEAT.
He presses some keys, makes a little more noise with it. (a
quarter of some sort of melody starts here...)

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry is cutting up his CREDIT CARD with some scissors. He
throws it away.

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry paces around a little bit.....CAMERA stays inside and
watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks
around....he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse --

-- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over
something....He stands up quick;

                         BARRY
            This is not supposed to be here.
            Seriously. Carlos, Carlos, this is
            really not supposed to be here. I
            don't mean to be a dick; but that's
            gonna hurt someone. It already did
            hurt someone: It hurt me, so please
            let's move that.

He backs away, then steps OUT OF FRAME...a moment later
ELIZABETH (his sister) and LENA (from the opening) enter the
warehouse, walking towards Barry;

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Lena)
            He's wearing a suit again, I don't
            know why he's wearing a suit, he
            doesn't usually dress like that --

                         LENA
            It's fine.

CAMERA pushes in towards LENA and blends to 30fps...she
smiles, looks ahead, CAMERA slowly pans a 180 around to
become her POV.

Barry is standing near the harmonium, fiddling around. He
looks up, sees Elizabeth and Lena walking towards him and
tenses....they meet in the middle of the warehouse;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, what are you doing? Why are
            you wearing a suit again?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Hi.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA
            Do you remember me, I left my car,
            yesterday.

                         BARRY
            Yes I do.

                         ELIZABETH
            This is Lena, she's a good friend
            of mine from work. We were in the
            neighborhood and she had to pick up
            her car and we're getting breakfast
            before we go in, so did you want to
            go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            I have work, I can't leave.

                         ELIZABETH
            Seriously, though: We're going to
            eat, I said.

                         BARRY
            I'm sorry.

                         LENA
            It's ok. That's alright.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you learning how to play the
            piano? What is that?

                         BARRY
            It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE!
            MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN
            TOLEDO.

                         LANCE (OC)
            WHICH?

                         BARRY
            ...I'll tell you later.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't wanna come to eat with us?

                         WORKER VOICE
            TELEPHONE BARRY ON LINE TWO!

                         ELIZABETH
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. Can you hang on a
            second?

CAMERA follows Barry as he walks back to his little office,
picks up the phone;

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            We got disconnected before....

                         BARRY
            No. No. We got disconnect --
            why?.....you're calling me at
            work....how did you get this
            number -- ?

                         SEXY VOICE
            See the thing is I could make it
            really easy on you -- I already
            have your credit card number, your
            information, address and stuff.
            This is so awkward asking like
            this, I'm sorry --

                         BARRY
            This makes me very uncomfortable.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I need help.

BEAT.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Should I just ask your girlfriend?
                   (beat)
            Maybe I should call back and talk
            to your girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            I don't have a girlfriend --

                         SEXY VOICE
            -- you said you did.

                         BARRY
            I know I did. But I don't.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You lied to me?

                         BARRY
            I didn't lie.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Why did you tell me you did, then?

                         BARRY
            This is....illegal....I'll call the
            police.

                         SEXY VOICE
            No you won't.

ANGLE, ELIZABETH AND LENA

                         LENA
            I'll go pay for my car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you sure?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         ELIZABETH
            He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have
            no idea why he's being weird and
            dressed in a suit --

                         LENA
            It's not bad, it's ok.

                         ELIZABETH
            -- he's so strange I don't know if
            you really even would want to go
            out with him, someone like him, I
            said I'd try, but it's just --

                         LENA
            It's ok, it's alright. I'll come
            right back, I'll just go pay for my
            car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Sorry.

She leaves. Elizabeth heads for Barry's office;

ANGLE, BARRY on the phone

                         SEXY VOICE
            Come on, I thought we had fun, rich
            boy --

                         BARRY
            This is not cool.

                         SEXY VOICE
            It was cool last night.

                         BARRY
            I have to go.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are you telling me no?

                         BARRY
            No I'm sorry, now I have to get off
            the phone....

                         SEXY VOICE
            ....this is your mistake....

Elizabeth comes walking into his office, starts whispering
to him as he's on the phone;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, hey, you should ask her out --
            what do you think, she's cute, right?

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            I'm gonna call you back.

He starts to hang up the phone, turns to Elizabeth as we hear;

                         SEXY VOICE
                   (trailing off)
            ...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....

                         BARRY
            She is. I think, why did you come
            here like this?

                         ELIZABETH
            It's not cool?

                         BARRY
            It's fine, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- do you think you'll ask her out?

                         BARRY
            I feel really on the spot now.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you gonna do it?

                         BARRY
            I don't do that. I don't - things
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't do anything, why are you
            being scared?

                         BARRY
            I'm not being scared, you're just
            going to rag me if I do this --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I
            do this just to rag you?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'll leave then, I'll go to get
            something from my car, go away so
            you don't feel pressure. Can I ask
            you a serious question:

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            Did you ask Walter to get you a
            shrink?
                   (beat)
            Barry, did you ask Walter to get
            you a shrink? What's wrong with you?
            Are you ok?

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

                         ELIZABETH
            You're being weird again, see. Come
            on. Please don't be weird.

ANGLE, BARRY AND ELIZABETH, MOMENTS LATER
They walk out and as they do, Lena comes back in with her
keys in her hand, Elizabeth keeps walking past;

                         ELIZABETH
            I gotta grab something from my car....

                         LENA
            We should be going --

                         ELIZABETH
                   (over her shoulder)
            Yeah, no, I have to get something
            from my car, I said.

Barry and Lena about to be alone as Lance walks up;

                         LANCE
            Which guy in Toledo are you talking
            about?

                         BARRY
            I'll tell you...the
            guy...with...just talk to me later
            about it, ok?

                         LANCE
            You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?

                         BARRY
            I have to talk to you in a second
            about that, Lance, ok?

He walks away, Lena turns to him;

                         LENA
            I'm sorry I couldn't come to your
            sister's birthday party last night,
            Elizabeth had invited me and I
            couldn't make it --

                         BARRY
            It's fine. It was fun, though.

                         LENA
            It must be weird for you to have so
            many sisters?

                         BARRY
            No. Not at all. It's nice.

                         WORKER (OC)
            Telephone, Barry Line One!

Barry turns instantly and walks away....he turns back as he
walks....TWO SHOT - track left with him....

                         BARRY
                   (turns back)
            One second, sorry.

IN THE OFFICE, THAT MOMENT
He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Hang up again and see the trouble
            it's gonna make.

Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks
back to Lena;

                         LENA
            Business is good, you're busy?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, not really.

                         LENA
            I saw a picture of you.

                         BARRY
            Yes.
                         LENA
            Elizabeth has a picture of you
            guys -- your sisters and you, it's
            a lot of family, it must be nice.

                         BARRY
            Do you have brothers or sisters?

                         LENA
            No. I'm the exact opposite --

                         BARRY
            That must be nice. That must be
            really, really, really great.

                         LENA
            It's terrible, no.

No response from Barry. (cut to reverse 2-shot as they look)

                         LENA
            What do you do with all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            That's not mine it's one of the
            guys that works here. That
            pudding's not mine.

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a
large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using
a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the
ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;

                         LENA
            Oh My God.

                         BARRY
            It's ok. That's ok. How long have
            you worked with Elizabeth?

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to
Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;

                         LENA
            Six months, maybe five, five or six
            months...do you wanna check that?

                         BARRY
                   (to the guys)
            Are you guys hurt?

                         WORKERS/LANCE
            No, no, we're ok....Barry, sorry --
                         BARRY
                   (back to Lena)
            So you do what she does, the same
            work, the same job?

                         LENA
            I do, but I do field consultations
            mainly too which is cool because I
            get to travel. I travel. A lot of
            the time. I'm going to Hawaii on
            Friday.

                         BARRY
            That's great -- Hawaii. I was
            thinking about going there.

                         LENA
            Really?

                         BARRY
            I was, yeah, I was thinking about
            going there for business --

                         LENA
            -- well, if you're gonna go --

                         BARRY
            -- I'm probably not gonna go though.

                         LENA
            -- oh that's too bad, it's so great
            over there and if you were there we
            could say hello to each other or
            something --

                         BARRY
            -- yeah that would be great, if I
            was gonna go but I'm not exactly
            sure, I have so much goin on
            here -- A lot depends on this thing
            I might do here and if that happens
            I can't go and if it doesn't happen
            then I probably will, but I doubt it.

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box
that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In
other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,
they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She
looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight
ahead; CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back
in.....says to Barry:

                         ELIZABETH
            I can't find that thing in my car,
            I can't find it so I'll just get it
            and give it to you later. So?

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            You ready?

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you coming to eat with us?

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (at the crates)
            OH MY GOD. Look at that.

                         LENA
                   (to Barry)
            It was great to meet you again. To
            see you again, thanks for helping
            me yesterday --

                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            It's not mine.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why's it here?

                         BARRY
            I have no idea.

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            Are you ready?

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            Will you call me later to talk
            about asking Walter for the shrink?
            And we can talk about - he said you
            have this crying problem or something?

                         LENA
            Bye, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Goodbye.

                         ELIZABETH
            Call me later.

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;
Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning
up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music
Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of
harmonium so far)/gentle.

                         ELIZABETH
            So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?

                         LENA
            Ok.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits
until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway
and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight
back into the warehouse.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

She comes walking in and over to Barry;

                         LENA
            I'm going to go and eat tomorrow
            night do you want to go with me?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Do you want to pick me up?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Can I write down my address and
            phone number for you?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all
written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this
there is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the
boys -- Barry and Lena settle up and say so long.

                         BARRY
            This is funny.

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask anyone for a shrink,
            that was someone else. Also: This
            pudding is not mine. Also: I'm
            wearing a suit because I had a very
            important business meeting this
            morning and I don't have a crying
            problem.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            Alright?

                         LENA
            ....Hi.....

                         BARRY
            ....Hi.....

She walks off. CAMERA leads her out, holds a CU. as she
smiles to herself -- lead her a bit more until she's
outside, and she gets in her car --

CU. BARRY. He smiles, looks around, holds back his emotion
so it looks like he'll explode....tenses, smiles, tears,
looks around....HOLD. End Music Que.

Barry walks in. HOLD. He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            You've just made a war that you
            cannot afford.

She hangs up real quick. HOLD. Barry and his harmonium.

                         DAVID
            I'll do it.

                         JIM
            I'll do it too.

                         DAVID
            But it's gotta wait until my knee
            is better. I can't risk it.

                         LATISHA
            You have to do it now.

                         JIM
            If we drive there it's a problem.

                         LATISHA
            Dean will loan you one of his cars.

                         JIM
            Which one?

                         LATISHA
            You have to talk to him --

                         DAVID
            How do you know he's rich?

                         LATISHA
            Because I know, I just know. I
            mean, I talked to him, I know.

Nate emerges a bit from the b.g.

                         NATE
            Where are you guys going?

                         DAVID
            California. Los Angeles.

                         NATE
            When are you leaving?

                         DAVID
            Right now.

                         LATISHA
            Let's go talk to Dean.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - LATER

LATISHA, DAVID, JIM and NATE enter and meet DEAN TRUMBELL,
listening to AFTER EDEN play onstage, standing in the middle
of the room.

                         DEAN
            Hey guys.

                         DAVID/JIM/NATE
            Hey, Dean.

                         LATISHA
            So they'll go.

                         DEAN
            I'm only paying two of you guys.

                         DAVID
            That's cool.

                         DEAN
            When can you leave?

                         DAVID
            As soon as you want.

                         DEAN
            I want you to go right away, I
            think that's best. I also need you
            to check out a car for me down
            there that this guy is selling.

They walk towards a back room, as they do they pass a
REGULAR JOE who bumps into Dean accidentally, Dean explodes;

                         DEAN
            You wanna fuck around, asshole? You
            wanna get tough, wanna see me kick
            some motherfuck around here?

                         REGULAR JOE
            Take it easy, man, relax. Don't --
                         DEAN
            I'll relax your fucking head --
            this is my personal space, man,
            this is my personal fucking space,
            you don't violate that, you don't
            do that.

                         REGULAR JOE
            I've got a glass in my hand why
            don't you chill out?

                         DEAN
            You've got a glass?

Dean takes a BEER BOTTLE and SMASHES it in half on the bar,
holds it up to the guy --

                         DEAN
            YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A GLASS, NOW I'VE
            GOT A GLASS. I'VE GOT A GLASS TOO
            MOTHERFUCK.

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - MOMENTS LATER

They're all walking towards a back room of the bar, they
walk past a COUPLE that is fighting. The WOMAN is screaming
at the top of her lungs at the MAN;

                         WOMAN
            I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL FUCKING
            CRUSH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

Dean gets in the middle of it;

                         DEAN
            Take it easy, take it easy you guys
            in here, I need to talk to you
            later, Tommy -- I wanna know if you
            wanna book the boys --

He motions over his shoulder to Ashes to Ashes.

                         MAN
            I'll talk to you later.

                         WOMAN
            YOU WON'T FUCKIN' TALK TO HIM
            LATER, I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL
            CRUSH YOU, ASSHOLE.

                                            CUT TO:
INT. DEAN'S OFFICE/UPSTAIRS/BACKROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They enter into an upstairs office area. It has a couple
desks and off to the side, in a small, partitioned off room
is The Phone Sex Area; a GIRL on the phone. (We hear bits of
her call, e.g. "Me? I'm in Florida. Laying on my bed.")

There are posters for Ashes to Ashes, filing cabinets,
posters of CARS, lots of various small business items like
order forms and pamphlets, etc. Dean collects a piece of
paper and hands it to David/Nate/Jim;

                         DEAN
            Your expenses are your own.

                         DAVID
            I thought Latisha said you would --

                         DEAN
            -- she didn't know what she was
            talking about --

                         DAVID
            It's....whatever....that's not cool.

                         DEAN
            David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It
            doesn't make sense if you think
            about it in a fair deal like sense.
            Ok? It's business. Seriously. One
            hundred dollars for two days work
            is a lot more than your family is
            making sitting around your house.
            I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now.
            Just stop.

He hands him a set of KEYS and goes through the info;

                         DEAN
            ...keys for the track. You have to
            gas it up and save the receipts on
            that. His address. We have a
            business address too if you need
            that -- but hit him at his house
            first, see what this little bad boy
            is all about and shake him up --
            give him a little doe-see-doe --

                         LATISHA
            Uch. Shut up, Dean.

                         DEAN
            What's the problem?

                         LATISHA
            You don't need to talk all macho,
            "shake him out, little bad boy."
            Whatever -- you're not an action
            hero, tough guy, you're not a
            gangster --

He makes a very SUDDEN AND QUICK MOVE towards her and she
FLINCHES.

                         DEAN
            Flinchy. That's what I thought.
            Shut up.
                   (to Greg)
            Call me when you see this guy --
            check him out see what's what. She
            asked him for seven fifty when she
            was on the phone with him, so --
            just call me when you get there.

He hands him another piece of paper and a photo;

                         DEAN
            This is this place called Ace
            Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't
            know exactly where this is and I
            don't understand these maps so just
            go there and check it out. It's a
            '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says
            is fine, but I need to figure out
            why he's only asking 23 for it. So
            take a look, the whole thing, call
            me about that, if it seems alright
            then I'll head down there and check
            it out.

                         DAVID
            Ok.

                         DEAN
            That's it.

                         DAVID
            Can we maybe ask for more money on
            this?

                         LATISHA
            Why?

                         DAVID
            ...because it's California? I mean
            it's like a nine or ten hour drive.
            It's not like going to Salt Lake
            and getting the Mormon's, it's
            different...

After a long, long staring contest with David, Dean SUDDENLY
AND VERY VIOLENTLY PUTS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WALL....then
turns to David......Latisha rolls her eyes. David, Nate and
Jim leave.

                                            CUT TO:

down the street.....they call their brother "Mike D" on the
phone and say, "what's up, we're goin' to Los Angeles, you
wanna go?"

EXT/INT. LENA'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - EVENING

This is a SPLIT SCREEN SEQUENCE shot with TWO CAMERAS.

THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN holds Lena. She waits in her
small, nondescript apartment doing the things you do while
waiting for someone else. She sits, stands, sits, stands....

THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE THE SCREEN travels (STEADICAM) with
Barry as he walks into the RECEPTION AREA. There is a
SECURITY GUARD (black, female) who asks him his name, where
he's going and to sign in. The Security Guard calls up to
Lena's place....

....and we watch Lena answer the phone....

...The Security Guard gives Barry some very complicated
directions....we follow/lead Barry as he makes his way
through the maze/up elevators/down corridors looking for
Lena's apartment.....Finally, he arrives, knocks;

                         LENA
            Who is it?

                         BARRY
            It's Barry.

As she opens the door, THE SPLIT SCREEN SLIDES AWAY AND THE
IMAGES GIVE WAY TO THE ONE OF LENA standing;

                         LENA
            Hi.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lena and Barry at a table. They talk (see notes.)

                         LENA
            So I want to tell you something, I
            gotta tell you: I saw a picture of
            you guys, your sisters and you and
            I saw your picture and I really
            wanted to meet you.
                   (beat)
            I came to drop my car off there on
            purpose, to try and meet you.

Barry leans a little bit out of FRAME.

                         BARRY
            ...really? That's nice...are you
            lying?

                         LENA
            ...I thought I should tell you. I
            didn't want to get too far along on
            going out and be hiding something --

BEAT. He leans slightly back in FRAME.

                         BARRY
            That's very nice. Thank you. Thank
            you for saying that.
                   (beat)
            You're friends with my sister?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            How long have you known her?

                         LENA
            About six months.

                         BARRY
            You like her?

                         LENA
            Yeah. Yeah we get along well.
                   (beat)
            You didn't get along with her very
            well?

                         BARRY
            Did you really come to meet me on
            purpose or are you lying about that?

                         LENA
            No, no. I did.

                         BARRY
            That's nice. It's nice.
                   (beat)
            I've been looking around a lot
            lately at promotional giveaways,
            cross promotional work by some
            companies. Do you remember all that
            pudding?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So that pudding was bought, I
            bought that pudding because of a
            pretty interesting promotion that's
            sponsored by Healthy Choice and
            American Airlines. It's designed to
            encourage airline travel and
            obviously designed to encourage
            buying Healthy Choice products.
            They make frozen meals, deli meats,
            pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
            creams, this sort of thing.....

                         LENA
            Yeah?

                         BARRY
            ....I'm sorry....I lost my
            thoughts, what I was saying....

                         LENA
            You were talking about the
            promotion --

                         BARRY
            -- the promotion says: buy any 10
            Healthy Choice products and get 500
            miles of airline travel or 1,000
            for purchases made with a special
            coupon. So in the supermarket, you
            notice their products, first you
            notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken
            Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty
            good deal....but then I noticed
            they had soup at 89 cents a
            can.....and you start to do the
            math and you start to notice that
            it's a really amazing deal because
            I stumbled across the pudding at 25
            cents a cup. Now the crucial thing
            is the bar codes on the label.
            That's those little bar codes, you
            know? The universal product codes?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That's what's used to redeem the
            mileage, so in noticing the
            pudding, each cup had an individual
            bar code -- in other words: Two
            dollars and fifty cents for ten
            cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
            in the coupon: it's one thousand.
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah, no, I see --

                         BARRY
            You see if you spent $3,000 dollars
            on pudding you could earn over one
            million frequent flyer miles.

                         LENA
            That's insane. That is really,
            really crazy. That's just crazy if
            you spend three thousand dollars on
            pudding.

                         BARRY
            ....yeah....

                         LENA
            So that was your pudding?

                         BARRY
            ....No....

                         LENA
            I'm sorry. I thought you said --

                         BARRY
            No I didn't say that.

                         LENA
            I thought you said you bought all
            that pudding --

                         BARRY
            My friend Carlos is doing it who
            works with me. It's his. It's his
            pudding, he's doing it. It's not
            mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
            do it. He's the one who's insane.
            He only spent about one hundred
            dollars so far though --

                         LENA
            Your sister was telling me a pretty
            funny story about you, when you
            guys were kids and you were
            building a ramp for your dog and
            you threw a hammer through a window?
            Is that right? You threw a hammer
            through a sliding glass door?

Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very
quickly, holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his
nose, and then he smiles;

                         BARRY
            I don't remember that, she might be
            lying. I have to go the bathroom.

He gets up and goes.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Barry walks in and goes a little crazy. He's mad at himself
and he HITS a stall....it seems loose already and falls
straight to the floor.

This makes him go crazier and he continues to BEAT and KICK
the shit out of the bathroom/stall.

HOLD. He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks
around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he
exits....

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RESTARAUNT - MOMENTS LATER

Barry comes back and sits down, seems a little better. Tries
to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before: the
MANAGER comes over, leans in carefully;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         LENA & BARRY
            Hi.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, can I talk to you?

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Just have you for one second, please.

He looks to Lena, excuses himself.

ANGLE, OFF TO THE SIDE.
The Manager and Barry step away, in a quiet section of the
restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto; SLOW ZOOM IN.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         MANAGER
            Did you do it?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            You didn't just smash up the bathroom?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            Well who did?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         MANAGER
            You're hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I cut myself.

                         MANAGER
            How?

                         BARRY
            On my knife.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, a young man saw you coming out
            of the bathroom.

                         BARRY
            I didn't do that.

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            Why? ...what?

                         MANAGER
            Your hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Sir, I have no way of proving that
            you demolished the bathroom --

                         BARRY
            I didn't do it.

                         MANAGER
            Alright, well you're gonna have to
            leave. You're gonna have to go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna call the police then, sir.

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this to me.

                         MANAGER
            The police are on their way.

                         BARRY
            Sorry.

He starts to move back....

                         BARRY
            Can I pay you here? Can I pay you
            for our drinks and salad?

                         MANAGER
            That's fine.

Barry takes out some money and hands it over.

                         BARRY
            Keep the change, please.

ANGLE, BACK AT THE TABLE.
They walk back to the table and Barry whispers down to her,
very close, STEADICAM (leads them out - continuous)

                         BARRY
            We should go I think, I don't like
            it here.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They head out of the restaraunt.

                         LENA
            Is everything ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         LENA
            What happened?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

                         LENA
            What did he want?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

They walk a bit.

                         BARRY
            I have a better idea of where we
            can go.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They walk some more.

                         BARRY
            There's a better place for us to eat.

                         LENA
            Did something happen; are you alright?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok.
            It's fine. Everything is fine.

They walk some more and get in the car.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

poor man's process.

                         LENA
            So....how is your harmonium doing?

Barry looks at her......

                         LENA
            Your portable reed organ....the piano.

                         BARRY
            Well, it's fine. Thank you.

                         LENA
            Did you pick it up from the street?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         LENA
            Did you take it from the street in
            front of your work?

                         BARRY
            ...yes I did...?

                         LENA
            Are you learning how to play it?

                         BARRY
            Yes? I'm trying.

                         LENA
            Oh that's great.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            So you must travel a lot with all
            that pudding you bought?

                         BARRY
            Yes no not really.

INT. LENA'S APARTMENT - LATER

Lena and Barry finishing up the date;

                         BARRY
            Ok....well...I'm gonna go.

                         LENA
            ...yeah...

                         BARRY
            It was nice to see you again, to
            see your face again, to go out with
            you --

                         LENA
            I'll be around and back in town in
            a few days --

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         LENA
            If you come to Hawaii --

                         BARRY
            Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about
            that.

                         LENA
            You don't think you'll go --

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Ok. Well call me when you get back,
            I mean, I'll call you when I get
            back. I'll be back for three weeks
            and then I go away for a month
            after that. So maybe in that time....

                         BARRY
            Ok. Have a good trip.

They do a shake hands/kiss on cheek goodbye.

INT. RECEPTION AREA/LENA'S BUILDING

Barry steps out of the elevator and walks to the exit,
passing a RECEPTION DESK WOMAN.....we hear the PHONE
RINGING......she calls out;

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            Are you Barry?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            It's for you.

Barry walks towards the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         LENA (OC)
            This is Lena.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA (OC)
            I just wanted you to know, wherever
            you're going or whatever you're
            doing right now I want you to know
            that I wanted to kiss you just then.

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So what do I do then?

INT. MAZE OF CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

CAMERA pushes down towards him as he walks towards the door.
He knocks, she opens up, CAMERA SLIDES right in and lands as

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I'll see you later.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            I don't freak out very often.

                         LENA
            What do you mean?

                         BARRY
            I don't, no matter what my sisters
            say, ok?

                         LENA
            ...I don't know what you mean....

                         BARRY

            Hey.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         DAVID
            I need to talk to you for a second.

                         BARRY
            What?

                         DAVID
            You gotta give me some money.

Barry starts to walk away....David walks alongside him,
casually.....Barry looks over and sees the car has pulled
up....

                         DAVID
            You made a phone call and you said
            you'd help a girl out and then you
            didn't....I'm here to get the money.

                         BARRY
            Wait a minute --

                         DAVID
            No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't
            make it a thing --

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this.

                         DAVID
            It's just you need to give me the
            money...do you have it right now?

MIKE D violently PUSHES BARRY STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND.

                         BARRY
            Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't
            please....

                         DAVID
            How much money do you have in your
            pockets?

                         BARRY
            Just take it, take the money in my
            pockets, take it, it's fine --

They grab the money from his pockets as they hold him down
on the ground;

                         BARRY
            It's three hundred and twenty
            dollars, just take it.

                         DAVID
            What do you have in the house?

                         BARRY
            Nothing....I mean, really...change,
            nothing....that's the cash I have....

                         DAVID
            You have an ATM?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         DAVID
            Is this where you live?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         DAVID
            You have another house somewhere or
            something?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MIKE D
            This is three hundred and twenty.
            Let's just go to your ATM and
            that'll be it --

                         BARRY
            I didn't promise her money. She
            said that it was confidential, this
            isn't fair --

Mike D pushes Barry's face.

                         MIKE D
            Shut up, be quiet. Be quiet.

                         BARRY
            -- don't --

                         DAVID
            HEY. You made a fucking sex call
            and now you're gonna pay. It's not
            a big thing -- just give us some
            money and then it's over -- we'll
            just walk down to the ATM and get
            your money out --

                         BARRY
            Alright, alright.

They pick him up and then;

                         BARRY
            How do you want to do this?

                         MIKE D
            Let's just go to the corner, we saw
            a place on the corner, you'll just
            get your max out and that's it --
            you get out what you can and that's
            it --

            you're a pervert -- you said you'd
            help someone out and you didn't so
            we're just getting some money for
            her and that's that.

                         BARRY
            You know, please, I just wanna say
            that I didn't say I would help her
            out; I was very clear about it....I
            don't think that this is
            fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch,

            They each have a bar code, so I
            need it scanned individually so
            that each and every cup appears on

            Barry?

He doesn't respond. He's asleep. He moves to the closet and
gets one of the HOTEL ROBES and puts it on and then he looks
right at her and says:

                         BARRY
            I was talkin' to you last Thursday
            about that.

            him anyway, honestly, he's such a

            whatever --

                         DEAN
            What did you say?

                         LATISHA
            Nothing.

                         DEAN
            Put him through.

                         LATISHA
            No, no. This is bad, something
            might have happened, we should
            just --

                         DEAN
            Shut up, just put him on the phone,
            it doesn't matter, just shut up --

INTERCUT NOW WITH BARRY/LATISHA/DEAN; She clicks over to him;

                         LATISHA
            Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you
            through to my supervisor.

                         BARRY
            Fine, thank you.

                         LATISHA
            Ok. You're connected.

                         DEAN
            Who is this?

                         BARRY
            Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I
            called your service --

                         DEAN
            Why don't you shut the fuck up?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         DEAN
            I said calm down and shut the fuck
            up. What's your problem?

                         BARRY
            I haven't even told you what's
            happened. Your girl that you have
            that works there for you threatened
            me and two men just chased me --
            extorted money --
                         DEAN
            Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't
            have anything to do with me - this
            is a legitimate bossiness.

                         BARRY
            YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK
            YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY
            LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM
            IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU
            AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT.
            YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.

                         DEAN
            CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM
            DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --

They stop screaming. Then:

                         DEAN
            Now are you threatening me, dick?

                         BARRY
            You are bad. You are a bad person.
            you are a bad person and you have
            no right to take people's confidence
            in your service --

                         DEAN
            You better watch your mouth, cunt,
            you're gonna get hurt.

                         BARRY
            NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.

                         DEAN
            I'll say whatever I want --

                         BARRY
            YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE
            I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER.
            YOU HURT HER.

                         DEAN
            You just told me to fuck off. That
            wasn't good. You're dead.

Dean hangs up the phone.

ANGLE, BARRY. He turns away and walks quickly out of his
office with the phone receiver to his ear.....the base of
the phone slides off the desk.....and then the receiver RIPS
from the base and he starts to run....

EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Barry runs down the alley way, much the same he ran down

He enters....and EMPLOYEE approaches;

                         BARRY

            Who?

                         BARRY
            Whoever owns this.

                         EMPLOYEE
            In the back.....

Barry walks towards the back.....he rounds a corner....to
reveal:

DEAN is in a back room, he's getting his hair cut by
LATISHA.....he turns and looks at Barry, who stands there
with the phone in his hand.

They stare at each other.

                         BARRY
            I'm a nice and reasonable man. I
            didn't do anything wrong. Please
            don't make me hurt you. And I'm
            telling you: that if you ever hurt
            me or if you hurt someone that I
            love.....I will hurt you many,
            many, many times over.....because
            it's not right to take people's trust.

                         DEAN
            You came all the way from Los
            Angeles to tell me that?

                         BARRY
            Yes I did.

Dean doesn't respond.

                         BARRY
            Can we agree that that is that?

                         DEAN
            That's that.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

Barry hands him the phone.

Barry exits.....as he's about to go out the doors, Dean
screams;

                         DEAN
            NOW GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE MAN.

            I called a phone sex line.
            I called a phone sex line before I

            brothers came after me and you got
            hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to

            I'm back and I have a lot of
            pudding that I can redeem in six to
            eight weeks and if you give me that
            much time I can get enough miles to
            fly with you wherever you have to
            go if you have to travel for your
            job because I don't want to be
            anywhere without you.....can you
            please let me redeem the mileage?

                         LENA
            You left me at the hospital.

                         BARRY
            I'm sorry.

                         LENA
            You can't do that.

                         BARRY
            Ok.

BEAT.

                         BARRY

INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING

CAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind
a desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN (Adam Sandler)

                         BARRY
            ...yes I'm still on hold...

                         OPERATOR
            And what was this?

                         BARRY
            I'm looking at your advertisement
            for the airline promotion and
            giveaway?

                         OPERATOR
            This is "Fly With Us?"

                         BARRY
            It's hard to understand because it
            says in addition to but I can't
            exactly understand in addition to
            what because there's actually
            nothing to add it too...

                         OPERATOR
            I think that's a type-o then, that
            would be a mistake.

                         BARRY
            So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten
            purchases of any of your Healthy
            Choice products equals five hundred
            miles and then with the coupon the
            same purchases would value one
            thousand miles --

                         OPERATOR
            That's it.

                         BARRY
            Do you realize that the monetary
            value of this promotion and the
            prize is potentially worth more
            than the purchases?

                         OPERATOR
            I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,
DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,
gets distracted, then back to the phone call;

                         BARRY
            Can I call you back if I have any
            further questions...? Can I get
            your extension?

                         OPERATOR
            It's extension 215 if you want to
            try me back.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's
fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products
seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key
chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT
THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him
out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks
down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,
shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto
mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at
the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up
landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies
past very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting
alone in the middle of the street.

He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside
his warehouse.

            means...

                         VOICE
            If they break or something. What is
            it, plastic?

                         BARRY
            It's a plastic, yeah.

                         VOICE
            Right. Alright, lemme call you
            first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run
            the numbers, see what's what and
            I'll give you a call back --

                         BARRY
            Did you have my home phone number?

                         VOICE
            For what?

                         BARRY
            If you wanted to call me back I
            could...

                         VOICE
            I'm fine, I have your work number.

                         BARRY
            Ok...because of the time difference
            if you needed to call me early?

                         VOICE
            It's fine. I can just get you at
            your office.

                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         VOICE
            Ok, bye, bye.

                         BARRY
            Bye.

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him
again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks
down the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the
Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD
(Emily Watson) exits the car and starts to walk down the
length of the alley towards him.....CAMERA stays over his
shoulder and turns into a profile 2-shot;

                         LENA
            Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         LENA
            They're not open yet?

                         BARRY
            They don't get opened until eight.

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.

                         LENA
            Is it ok if I leave my car you think?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            I thought they opened at seven.
                   (beat)
            If I left my car would it be ok?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Do you know them.

                         BARRY
            Not very well.

                         LENA
            Can I ask you, can I trust to leave
            my keys with you and give them to
            you so that when they get here you
            could give them to them?
                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         LENA
            You think it's ok where I left it,
            right there?

                         BARRY
            I think that'll be fine.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:

                         LENA
            There's a piano in the street.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank
            you for your help.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

                         LENA
            Maybe I'll see you later, when I
            pick up my car?

                         BARRY
            Ok.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,
hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the
end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her
shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks
off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks
around some more....then he makes the long walk down the
street.

ON THE STREET.
Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He
tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and
a small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and
holds the note.....

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his
office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps
the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then
stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note
melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who
enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;

                         LANCE
            Hey, good morning, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Hey...Lance....can I.....

                         LANCE
            You ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine.

                         LANCE
            Why you wearin' a suit?

                         BARRY
            Um....I bought one. I thought maybe
            it would be nice to get dressed for
            work, can I show you something?

                         LANCE
            Yeah.....you got here early huh?

                         BARRY
            ....yes.....

They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium;

                         LANCE
            What is this?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. I think it's a
            piano....a small piano.

                         LANCE
            That's not a piano.....I have a
            piano at home.....where'd you get it?

Lance walks around behind the harmonium....leaving Barry
alone....towards the warehouse......he starts to back up a
little.....

                         BARRY
            Well.....it was dropped on the
            street.....

Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind
Barry.....he sees them: CAMERA pushes in on Barry....

                         LANCE (OC)
            Why is it here? Barry....Barry?

                         BARRY
            ...it just....I don't know....I
            don't know.

INT. WAREHOUSE/MAIN AREA - DAY

CAMERA pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to TWO
CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front
of them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;

                         CUSTOMER
            You do guaranteed sale? etc.

                         BARRY
            We back our plungers 100% and we do
            ask for a 30 to 60 day display on
            the floor.....

In the b.g., RICO over the laud speaker says:

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister's on line one.

Barry doesn't move....

                         BARRY
            Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60
            days....

                         CUSTOMER
            I think you have a call?

Rico turns around, without loudspeaker;

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

They look at him a moment....

                         BARRY
            I'm just gonna grab this call real
            quick?

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby
at Rico's station;

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            .....This is Barry.

                         RHONDA
            Hey it's me, it's Rhonda. Are you
            coming to the party tonight?

                         BARRY
            Hi, Rhonda, yes I am.

                         RHONDA
            Bye.

She hangs up.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Yes I'll see you tonight.

Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that: One thing I
            wanted to point out, Dave, is that
            we've just received a large order
            from the Rio Hotel and Casino in
            Las Vegas where we're going to be
            supplying their hotel rooms with
            the dice and money plunger, so
            these babies are really moving well
            right now...

                         RICO

            Barry, your sister's on line two.
            Barry, your sister's on line two.

Barry tries again to ignore it....

                         BARRY
            With the Aqua Blast Whales and
            Speed Boats we're gonna ask for a
            display at eye level for the little
            kids.....

            Barry --

                         BARRY
            -- excuse me.

Barry walks back to the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         KAREN
            Hey it's me, what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            Hello, Karen. I'm just working.

                         KAREN
            Yeah but what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            I'm just working....I have some
            customers here.....

                         KAREN
            So you can't talk to me?

                         BARRY
            I have a few people here, I can't
            really chat right now.

                         KAREN
            "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"

                         BARRY
            Well, I can't talk though --

                         KAREN
            You just fucking said "chat," that
            is so -- what are you now? "chat."
            I'm just calling to make sure you
            show up at this party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Yes, I'll be there.

                         KAREN
            Fine. You get back to chatting with
            your precious customers.

                         BARRY
            Ok, bye-bye.

Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence
and walks back to the customers and says:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that.

                         CUSTOMER
            I didn't know you had a sister?

                         BARRY
            .....Well yes I do....
                   (beat)
            But one more thing I wanted to tell
            you guys about the new plungers is
            that we're making the handles now
            in a non-breakable material
            called.....

He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on
the table....it SMASHES and rice falls out everywhere....

                         BARRY
            Ok...this is one of the old ones, I
            think. Lance do we have any new
            plungers around?

Lance moves to get a new plunger....

                         BARRY
            That was a little embarrassing and
            that was one of the old handles so
            let me get a new one to show you --

                         RICO
                   (loudspeaker)
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

Barry holds, then;

                         CUSTOMER
            How many sisters do you have?

                         BARRY
            ....I have seven.

                         CUSTOMER #2
            Holy shit. You have seven sisters?

                         BARRY
            They're calling because we're
            having a party tonight for my
            sister and the they're just
            calling....can you hang on for just
            two more minutes....?

Barry walks this time into his office......CAMERA tracks
with Barry to his office, seeing him try and shake this
off.....He EXITS FRAME.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

Barry enters, takes a quick moment to size up the
harmonium.....He picks up the phone and through the
conversation gently moves the harmonium to a different spot
on the desk;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         KATHLEEN

            You can't be late though.

                         BARRY

                         KATHLEEN
            You can't just not show up like you
            do, you have to go.

                         BARRY

workers;

            Telephone Barry on line one.

A mechanic passes by at this moment, keeps walking past;

                         BARRY
            What's wrong with her car?

                         MECHANIC
            Wha?

                         BARRY
            Is that car gonna be ok?

                         MECHANIC
            It's fine.

The mechanic keeps walking....Barry enters.

Barry and the boys are prepping some boxes for shipping.
Ernesto walks over, says;

            Barry, your sister's here.

Barry stands up fast, stumbles back a bit over some boxes,
recovers, ELIZABETH enters:

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, how are you?
                         BARRY
            I'm fine, hi, how are you?

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm just stopping by to say hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello.

                         ELIZABETH
            So you're coming tonight, right?

                         BARRY
            Yes, indeed, yes I am.

                         ELIZABETH
            There's this girl, this friend of
            mine from work that I think is
            really cute and really cool and I
            want you to meet her so I was
            thinking about bringing her to the
            party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            Well I don't want to do something
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's my friend and you should meet
            her. You'd like her.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but please don't do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not really asking you, I'm
            telling you.

                         BARRY
            Yeah but please don't do that:
            everyone would be looking at me.

                         ELIZABETH
            It's a free country, we can look at
            you if we want to.

                         BARRY
            Yes but I get tense and I feel like
            I can't be myself if that happens.

                         ELIZABETH
            That's your fault not mine.

                         BARRY
            I don't think I'm going to the party.

                         ELIZABETH
            So it's ok if I bring her.

                         BARRY
            Please don't.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's really cute and she's really
            nice.

                         BARRY
            ...please, I just don't want it....

                         ELIZABETH
            ....wait a minute: why is this
            about you now? Why is it always
            about you?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to be your friend.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

                         BARRY
            Well, yeah, thank you, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- but since you're not going I
            guess none of this matters and I'll
            bring her anyway.

BEAT. HOLD. She stares him down.

                         ELIZABETH
            All I'm trying to do is be your
            friend.

She leaves. HOLD ON BARRY. He air punches/twitch.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER/BLUE HOUR - NIGHT

Barry is alone, closing up. He takes a look at the Harmonium
and presses it, makes a sound....a little bit more....makes
a few notes. END SCORE QUE as it blends and fades into the
notes that Barry plays.

BEAT. He closes its small cover, does something on his desk
and then:

His face gets bright red, he holds back tears, opens his
mouth and has a serious but small burst of overwhelming
emotion and then it's over.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

CU. BIRTHDAY CARD.
Barry's hands reaches in and picks a birthday card.

ANGLE, WIDER, THAT MOMENT.
Barry grabs the card and starts to push his cart....but he
pushes it straight into a SIX YEAR OLD KID who's pushing a
cart around....they slam into each other....

Barry apologizes....the KID just takes off....Barry's cart
now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy....

ANGLE, FROZEN FOOD AISLE.
CAMERA tracks left to right with Barry as he heads for the
Healthy Choice Frozen Dinner. He grabs one.

CU. BARRY. LOW ANGLE.
He looks at box.

BARRY'S POV - THE BOX
Slow zoom in. The sticker reads: "Fly Away With Us! The More
You Buy The More You Earn."

ANGLE, SOUP SECTION.
CAMERA tracks along right to left with Barry as he moves
towards some SOUP. He grabs one, inspects it.....then puts
it back.

CU. SOUP CAN.
It's put back on the shelf: TILT down to price: 79 cents.

Barry turns his cart around and SMACKS right into someone
else again, screwing up another wheel on his cart.

ANGLE, BARRY.
CAMERA, tracks alongside him, left to right as he comes
across: PUDDING. The price: 4/$1.00.

MED. BARRY in the middle of the aisle.
He reacts......smiles...holds....thinks....looks around,
then starts to load up on the pudding.

ANGLE, BARRY.
He pushes TWO SHOPPING CARTS FULL OF PUDDING over to the
STORE MANAGER who's on his knees, stacking milk.....Barry
kneels down, CAMERA PUSHES INTO A CU. as he speaks sotto;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello, sir. My name is Barry Egan
            and I'd like to ask if you have any
            more Healthy Choice pudding in the
            back?

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens slowly and Barry peers his head around and
into the house very cautiously, CAMERA PUSHES IN and PANS
slightly LEFT to reveal: THE KITCHEN.

Barry's SEVEN SISTERS are all there, preparing dinner and
talking away....they turn and see him;

                         SUSAN
            There he is! Do you remember when
            we used to call you gay and you'd
            get all mad?

                         KATHLEEN
            -- we were calling you gay and you
            got so mad that you threw a hammer
            through the sliding glass door --
            do you remember?

                         BARRY
            I don't really remember that.

                         KATHLEEN
            Yes you do. We were calling you Gay
            Boy and you got so mad....

                         BARRY
            Yes, yes, right.

                         SUSAN
            We're trying to remember why you
            had the hammer in the first place?

                         BARRY
            ...um.....

                         KATHLEEN
            The hammer that you threw....why
            did you have it?

                         SUSAN
            You don't remember -- you had the
            hammer and you threw it -- ?

                         BARRY
            I remember, yes.....

                         SUSAN
            Why did you have it?

Another sister, RHONDA, enters from behind, Barry jumps, says:

                         RHONDA
            He was building a ramp for the dog.

                         KATHLEEN
            He was making a ramp for the dog!
            That's right!

                         SUSAN
            That's right....ramp for the
            dog..... And you just threw the
            hammer.

                         BARRY
                   (to Rhonda)
            Happy Birthday, Rhonda.

                         RHONDA
            Thank you. Thank you so much, Barry.

She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake
next to a bigger, cooler looking cake.

Mia approaches holding a baby.....Barry tries to say hello
to the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's
grasp....making herself the center of his attention;

KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, THAT MOMENT

Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the
baby...and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining
room, revealing himself to: ELIZABETH, KAREN, NICOLE AND
ANNA. There are also: THREE BROTHER IN LAW'S (WALTER, LARRY
AND STEVE)

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey....I was just telling everyone
            about how I was gonna bring this
            girl for you but you wouldn't let
            me do it.

                         BARRY
            Hello everyone.

KAREN steps up and greets him;

                         KAREN
            Did you think that we'd all be
            looking at you?

                         BARRY
            No, no, no.

                         KAREN
            Well it's just not true. We
            wouldn't be looking at you -- why
            are you wearing this suit? Did you
            say hello to your brother in law's?

                         STEVE/LARRY
            Hi, Barry. How ya doin? Good, good.

                         KAREN
            Say hello to them, that's right,
            good, good. Ok. Come on, we're
            gonna eat now.....let's go.....

Barry shakes hands and hello's with the brother in law's.
He's left alone for a moment with Walter and Elizabeth;

                         WALTER
            How you doin' Barry?

                         BARRY
            Hi Walter.

                         WALTER
            How's business?

                         BARRY
            Business is very food, thanks.
                         ELIZABETH
            What's very food?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            You just said very food.

                         BARRY
            Did I say that?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That was weird. I meant good.

                         WALTER
            Maybe you said that because you're
            hungry.....

Walter moves to help everyone...they're moving to set the
table......

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON BARRY AND ELIZABETH alone for a beat:

                         ELIZABETH
            You're lucky. She couldn't come
            anyway --

                         BARRY
            Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.

                         ELIZABETH
            She couldn't come I said. Are you
            nervous?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         ELIZABETH
            You look nervous.

                         BARRY
            I'm not, I'm very happy.

RHONDA passes;

                         RHONDA
            Come on homo-boy, we're eating now.

Elizabeth leaves, HOLD ON BARRY.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TOWARDS EVERYONE SETTING THE
TABLE.....CAMERA ROTATES AROUND.....everyone is still
chatting a bit about "Barry gay boy," and "the girl that was
gonna be here that Barry wouldn't allow."

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry is standing in front of the floor to
ceiling sliding glass doors.....in an INSTANT, he TURNS AND
THROWS HIS FIST STRAIGHT THROUGH THREE OF THEM, THEY
SHATTER....he turns back, they are all staring straight at
him in silence. HOLD, THEN:

In unison they all go ape shit:

                         GROUP
            WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM.
            GODDAMNIT BARRY. YOU FUCKIN' MANIAC.
            ETC. ETC.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

It's later and WALTER and BARRY walk down a small hall and
into a kids room. They're OC for a few moments as the CAMERA
slowly pushes in and towards the room. Following sotto;

                         WALTER
            What's up?

                         BARRY
            Well I'm sorry. Before...

                         WALTER
            Mhm.

                         BARRY
            And I'm sorry that I did that.

                         WALTER
            It's alright.

                         BARRY
            I wanted to ask you because you're
            a doctor, right?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I don't like the way I am sometimes.
                   (beat)
            Can you help me?
                         WALTER
            Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of
            help do you think I can give you?

                         BARRY
            I know that. Maybe you know other
            doctors?

                         WALTER
            Like a psychiatrist?

                         BARRY
            I don't have anyone to talk to
            things about and I understand it's
            confidential with a doctor - I'm
            embarrassed about that and I don't
            want my sisters to know?

                         WALTER
            You want a number for a
            psychiatrist, I can get you one,
            that's not a problem. but what
            exactly is wrong?

                         BARRY
            I don't know if there's anything
            wrong with me because I don't know
            how other people are.....Sometimes
            I cry a lot.....for no reason.

Barry starts to cry. Walter just stares at his. HOLD.

Barry stops, recuperates, then leaves.....as he does;

                         BARRY
            Please don't tell my sisters.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

CU. HEALTHY CHOICE COUPON.
Barry's scissors cut out a coupon and reveal an image
beneath in another section of the newspaper...it's the sexy
LEG of a woman....

the ad...

HOLD ON HIS FACE. He looks....then:

                         OPERATOR GIRL (OC)
            You want her to call you Jack?

            No I just....I don't want to, I
            just want to be connected to talk
            to a girl.

                         OPERATOR GIRL (OC)
            It's a call back service -- a girl
            will call you back.

                         BARRY

            I'm just laying on my bed.

                         BARRY
            Where are you?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm in my bedroom.

                         BARRY
            No, I mean, what city, what state
            are you in?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are you watching a porno movie?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Do you like porno movies?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....? So...Jack...are you
            stroking that big fat fucking cock
            of yours?

He walks into something.

                         BARRY
            ....no....

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah? So what are you doing, then?

                         BARRY
            ...just talking to you....

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are your pants off?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah. And looking at myself in the
            mirror. Do you wanna know what I
            look like?

                         BARRY
            It doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            What do you mean it doesn't matter?

                         BARRY
            Well. I have no way of knowing. So
            it doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8,
            blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I
            work out. My pussy's shaved. My
            friends say I'm pretty cute, so....

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         SEXY VOICE
            What do you mean, "really?" Yeah.
            Really. What about you?

                         BARRY
            It doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....you're married aren't you,
            Jack?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You have a girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            ...yes...

                         SEXY VOICE
            Where is she?

                         BARRY
            She's...not here...she went out.
            She went out of town, she travels a
            lot.

Barry holds his head in his hands for minute, then stands
out of it --

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm horny, Jack, what about you?

                         BARRY
            ...yeah.....

                         SEXY VOICE
            Does Jack like to Jack Off?

                         BARRY

                         SEXY VOICE

                         SEXY VOICE
            Thank you. What do you do, Barry?

                         BARRY
            I have my own business....I work. I
            work hard at doing my business.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....do you do well, do you make
            alotta money?

                         BARRY
            I do pretty good, I think. I wish I
            was making more, doing a little bit
            better. I can,t get over a certain
            hump. I will...I will crack
            something soon I think and really
            do better...I'd like to
            diversify...but I'm doing great, I
            think, as a start.

                         SEXY VOICE
            So.....are you stroking it, yet,
            honey?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Well why don't you take your pants
            off and stroke it for me?

                         BARRY
            Ok.
                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah...that's it...God I Am So
            Horny...I wish I was there to help
            you.....I wish I was there for you,

INT. BARRY'S BATHROOM/BEDROOM - LATER

It's a little bit later and Barry stands in his bathroom,
washes his face....HOLD....then he dries his face, walks
into his bedroom, gets into bed wearing T-shirt and
underwear.....he crawls in, curls up in fetal position....

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

INT. SAME EXACT ANGLE - MORNING

Sun comes in now. Barry is somehow dressed in a FULL ADIDAS
SWEAT SUIT complete with SNEAKERS. He wakes up, looks down
and sees this, confused;

                         BARRY
            Whassis?

                                            CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barry is dressed for work in another suit now. He grabs some
stuff and heads for the door when the phone rings;

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Hey. What are you doing? How are you?

                         BARRY
            I'm fine. Who is this?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Georgia.

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            Hi....what....what's up....?

                         SEXY VOICE
            It's ok that I'm calling, right, I
            mean? It's ok.

                         BARRY
            Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I just wanted to call and talk to
            you, thank you for last night, try
            and get you before you went to work
            and say, "hey."

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            I'm going to work.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed
            up too late last night, what about
            you, when did you go to sleep?

                         BARRY
            Not very late.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You're going to work now?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Can I ask you a question?

                         BARRY
            Uh-huh.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Remember last night I was talking
            to you and I was telling you about
            my apartment, my rent -- ?
                   (beat)
            Do you remember?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         SEXY VOICE
            This is really weird and really
            embarrassing for me but....uh....
                   (beat)
            I was wondering if you could help
            me out with a little bit of money.

                         BARRY
            Me?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I
            can't afford it.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You don't even know how much it is.

                         BARRY
            I know but I....how much is it?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?

                         BARRY
            Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't
            afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Really? Please?

                         BARRY
            You have trouble, financial trouble?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah. It's so hard these days and I
            really need it.

                         BARRY
            Yes I can't....I don't make enough
            money to be able to do that.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I thought you had your own business.
            You said you were gonna diversify
            and all that stuff....

BEAT. Barry steps back a little....

                         SEXY VOICE
            So you think you can?

                         BARRY
            No. I'm sorry.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Should I call back and talk to your
            girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            ....what....?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I was wondering if it's better to
            ask your girlfriend for the money?
            It could be really easy. I mean, I
            have all your information, credit
            card information and billing stuff --

Barry hangs up the phone real fast. HOLD. He doesn't move.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S WORK/WAREHOUSE - MORNING/LATER

CAMERA (HAND HELD) behind Barry, as he walks through the
warehouse, greets the boys, says hello to Lance, etc. Lance,
taking his cue from Barry, is a bit more dressed up today....

                         LANCE
            Good morning, Barry....

                         BARRY
            Hi, Lance.

                         LANCE
            What's with all this pudding, what
            is this?

CAMERA sees that all the pudding Barry bought has been
stacked neatly in a corner. Barry stops dead in his tracks
to explain;

                         BARRY
            That's part of a very interesting
            airline promotion giveaway that's
            really tremendous. I'm going to
            start a collection of pudding and
            coupons that can be redeemed for
            frequent flyer miles through
            Healthy Choice and American
            Airlines --

                         LANCE
            You're goin' on a trip?

                         BARRY
            No.........but airline miles are
            just like a currency these days.

                         LANCE
            You should go on a trip.

                         BARRY
            No thanks.

                         LANCE
            So what should I do with the pudding?

                         BARRY
            Let's just leave it there for now.

Barry goes into his office and looks at the Harmonium. BEAT.
He presses some keys, makes a little more noise with it. (a
quarter of some sort of melody starts here...)

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry is cutting up his CREDIT CARD with some scissors. He
throws it away.

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry paces around a little bit.....CAMERA stays inside and
watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks
around....he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse --

-- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over
something....He stands up quick;

                         BARRY
            This is not supposed to be here.
            Seriously. Carlos, Carlos, this is
            really not supposed to be here. I
            don't mean to be a dick; but that's
            gonna hurt someone. It already did
            hurt someone: It hurt me, so please
            let's move that.

He backs away, then steps OUT OF FRAME...a moment later
ELIZABETH (his sister) and LENA (from the opening) enter the
warehouse, walking towards Barry;

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Lena)
            He's wearing a suit again, I don't
            know why he's wearing a suit, he
            doesn't usually dress like that --

                         LENA
            It's fine.

CAMERA pushes in towards LENA and blends to 30fps...she
smiles, looks ahead, CAMERA slowly pans a 180 around to
become her POV.

Barry is standing near the harmonium, fiddling around. He
looks up, sees Elizabeth and Lena walking towards him and
tenses....they meet in the middle of the warehouse;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, what are you doing? Why are
            you wearing a suit again?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Hi.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA
            Do you remember me, I left my car,
            yesterday.

                         BARRY
            Yes I do.

                         ELIZABETH
            This is Lena, she's a good friend
            of mine from work. We were in the
            neighborhood and she had to pick up
            her car and we're getting breakfast
            before we go in, so did you want to
            go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            I have work, I can't leave.

                         ELIZABETH
            Seriously, though: We're going to
            eat, I said.

                         BARRY
            I'm sorry.

                         LENA
            It's ok. That's alright.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you learning how to play the
            piano? What is that?

                         BARRY
            It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE!
            MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN
            TOLEDO.

                         LANCE (OC)
            WHICH?

                         BARRY
            ...I'll tell you later.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't wanna come to eat with us?

                         WORKER VOICE
            TELEPHONE BARRY ON LINE TWO!

                         ELIZABETH
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. Can you hang on a
            second?

CAMERA follows Barry as he walks back to his little office,
picks up the phone;

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE

            No. No. We got disconnect --
            why?.....you're calling me at
            work....how did you get this
            number -- ?

                         SEXY VOICE
            See the thing is I could make it
            really easy on you -- I already
            have your credit card number, your
            information, address and stuff.
            This is so awkward asking like
            this, I'm sorry --

                         BARRY
            This makes me very uncomfortable.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I need help.

BEAT.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Should I just ask your girlfriend?
                   (beat)
            Maybe I should call back and talk
            to your girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            I don't have a girlfriend --

                         SEXY VOICE
            -- you said you did.

                         BARRY
            I know I did. But I don't.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You lied to me?

                         BARRY
            I didn't lie.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Why did you tell me you did, then?

                         BARRY
            This is....illegal....I'll call the
            police.

                         SEXY VOICE
            No you won't.

ANGLE, ELIZABETH AND LENA

                         LENA
            I'll go pay for my car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you sure?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         ELIZABETH
            He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have
            no idea why he's being weird and
            dressed in a suit --

                         LENA
            It's not bad, it's ok.

                         ELIZABETH
            -- he's so strange I don't know if
            you really even would want to go
            out with him, someone like him, I
            said I'd try, but it's just --

                         LENA
            It's ok, it's alright. I'll come
            right back, I'll just go pay for my
            car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Sorry.

She leaves. Elizabeth heads for Barry's office;

ANGLE, BARRY on the phone

                         SEXY VOICE
            Come on, I thought we had fun, rich
            boy --

                         BARRY
            This is not cool.

                         SEXY VOICE
            It was cool last night.

                         BARRY
            I have to go.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are you telling me no?

                         BARRY
            No I'm sorry, now I have to get off
            the phone....

                         SEXY VOICE
            ....this is your mistake....

Elizabeth comes walking into his office, starts whispering
to him as he's on the phone;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, hey, you should ask her out --
            what do you think, she's cute, right?

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            I'm gonna call you back.

He starts to hang up the phone, turns to Elizabeth as we hear;

                         SEXY VOICE
                   (trailing off)
            ...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....

                         BARRY
            She is. I think, why did you come
            here like this?

                         ELIZABETH
            It's not cool?

                         BARRY
            It's fine, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- do you think you'll ask her out?

                         BARRY
            I feel really on the spot now.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you gonna do it?

                         BARRY
            I don't do that. I don't - things
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't do anything, why are you
            being scared?

                         BARRY
            I'm not being scared, you're just
            going to rag me if I do this --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I
            do this just to rag you?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'll leave then, I'll go to get
            something from my car, go away so
            you don't feel pressure. Can I ask
            you a serious question:

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            Did you ask Walter to get you a
            shrink?
                   (beat)
            Barry, did you ask Walter to get
            you a shrink? What's wrong with you?
            Are you ok?

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

                         ELIZABETH
            You're being weird again, see. Come
            on. Please don't be weird.

ANGLE, BARRY AND ELIZABETH, MOMENTS LATER
They walk out and as they do, Lena comes back in with her
keys in her hand, Elizabeth keeps walking past;

                         ELIZABETH
            I gotta grab something from my car....

                         LENA
            We should be going --

                         ELIZABETH
                   (over her shoulder)
            Yeah, no, I have to get something
            from my car, I said.

Barry and Lena about to be alone as Lance walks up;

                         LANCE
            Which guy in Toledo are you talking
            about?

                         BARRY
            I'll tell you...the
            guy...with...just talk to me later
            about it, ok?

                         LANCE
            You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?

                         BARRY
            I have to talk to you in a second
            about that, Lance, ok?

He walks away, Lena turns to him;

                         LENA
            I'm sorry I couldn't come to your
            sister's birthday party last night,
            Elizabeth had invited me and I
            couldn't make it --

                         BARRY
            It's fine. It was fun, though.

                         LENA
            It must be weird for you to have so
            many sisters?

                         BARRY
            No. Not at all. It's nice.

                         WORKER (OC)
            Telephone, Barry Line One!

Barry turns instantly and walks away....he turns back as he
walks....TWO SHOT - track left with him....

                         BARRY
                   (turns back)
            One second, sorry.

IN THE OFFICE, THAT MOMENT
He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Hang up again and see the trouble
            it's gonna make.

Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks
back to Lena;

                         LENA
            Business is good, you're busy?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, not really.

                         LENA
            I saw a picture of you.

                         BARRY
            Yes.
                         LENA
            Elizabeth has a picture of you
            guys -- your sisters and you, it's
            a lot of family, it must be nice.

                         BARRY
            Do you have brothers or sisters?

                         LENA
            No. I'm the exact opposite --

                         BARRY
            That must be nice. That must be
            really, really, really great.

                         LENA
            It's terrible, no.

No response from Barry. (cut to reverse 2-shot as they look)

                         LENA
            What do you do with all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            That's not mine it's one of the
            guys that works here. That
            pudding's not mine.

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a
large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using
a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the
ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;

                         LENA
            Oh My God.

                         BARRY
            It's ok. That's ok. How long have
            you worked with Elizabeth?

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to
Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;

                         LENA
            Six months, maybe five, five or six
            months...do you wanna check that?

                         BARRY
                   (to the guys)
            Are you guys hurt?

                         WORKERS/LANCE
            No, no, we're ok....Barry, sorry --
                         BARRY
                   (back to Lena)
            So you do what she does, the same
            work, the same job?

                         LENA
            I do, but I do field consultations
            mainly too which is cool because I
            get to travel. I travel. A lot of
            the time. I'm going to Hawaii on
            Friday.

                         BARRY
            That's great -- Hawaii. I was
            thinking about going there.

                         LENA
            Really?

                         BARRY
            I was, yeah, I was thinking about
            going there for business --

                         LENA
            -- well, if you're gonna go --

                         BARRY
            -- I'm probably not gonna go though.

                         LENA
            -- oh that's too bad, it's so great
            over there and if you were there we
            could say hello to each other or
            something --

                         BARRY
            -- yeah that would be great, if I
            was gonna go but I'm not exactly
            sure, I have so much goin on
            here -- A lot depends on this thing
            I might do here and if that happens
            I can't go and if it doesn't happen
            then I probably will, but I doubt it.

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box
that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In
other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,
they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She
looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight
ahead; CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back
in.....says to Barry:

                         ELIZABETH
            I can't find that thing in my car,
            I can't find it so I'll just get it
            and give it to you later. So?

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            You ready?

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you coming to eat with us?

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (at the crates)
            OH MY GOD. Look at that.

                         LENA
                   (to Barry)
            It was great to meet you again. To
            see you again, thanks for helping
            me yesterday --

                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            It's not mine.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why's it here?

                         BARRY
            I have no idea.

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            Are you ready?

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            Will you call me later to talk
            about asking Walter for the shrink?
            And we can talk about - he said you
            have this crying problem or something?

                         LENA
            Bye, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Goodbye.

                         ELIZABETH
            Call me later.

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;
Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning
up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music
Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of
harmonium so far)/gentle.

                         ELIZABETH
            So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?

                         LENA
            Ok.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits
until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway
and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight
back into the warehouse.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

She comes walking in and over to Barry;

                         LENA
            I'm going to go and eat tomorrow
            night do you want to go with me?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Do you want to pick me up?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Can I write down my address and
            phone number for you?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all
written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this
there is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the
boys -- Barry and Lena settle up and say so long.

                         BARRY
            This is funny.

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask anyone for a shrink,
            that was someone else. Also: This
            pudding is not mine. Also: I'm
            wearing a suit because I had a very
            important business meeting this
            morning and I don't have a crying
            problem.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            Alright?

                         LENA
            ....Hi.....

                         BARRY
            ....Hi.....

She walks off. CAMERA leads her out, holds a CU. as she
smiles to herself -- lead her a bit more until she's
outside, and she gets in her car --

CU. BARRY. He smiles, looks around, holds back his emotion
so it looks like he'll explode....tenses, smiles, tears,
looks around....HOLD. End Music Que.

                         LANCE (OC)
            Barry, Line One, Telephone!

Barry walks in. HOLD. He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            You've just made a war that you
            cannot afford.

She hangs up real quick. HOLD. Barry and his harmonium.

INT. STEVENS BROTHERS HOUSE - DAY

CAMERA behind a BLONDE GIRLS HEAD (LATISHA). She speaks to
two blonde brothers, DAVID and JIM. In the b.g., walking
around holding a BABY is NATE. (Maybe a girlfriend or wife
or two).

                         DAVID
            I'll do it.

                         JIM
            I'll do it too.

                         DAVID
            But it's gotta wait until my knee
            is better. I can't risk it.

                         LATISHA
            You have to do it now.

                         JIM
            If we drive there it's a problem.

                         LATISHA
            Dean will loan you one of his cars.

                         JIM
            Which one?

                         LATISHA
            You have to talk to him --

                         DAVID
            How do you know he's rich?

                         LATISHA
            Because I know, I just know. I
            mean, I talked to him, I know.

Nate emerges a bit from the b.g.

                         NATE
            Where are you guys going?

                         DAVID
            California. Los Angeles.

                         NATE
            When are you leaving?

                         DAVID
            Right now.

                         LATISHA
            Let's go talk to Dean.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - LATER

LATISHA, DAVID, JIM and NATE enter and meet DEAN TRUMBELL,
listening to AFTER EDEN play onstage, standing in the middle
of the room.

                         DEAN
            Hey guys.

                         DAVID/JIM/NATE
            Hey, Dean.

                         LATISHA
            So they'll go.

                         DEAN
            I'm only paying two of you guys.

                         DAVID
            That's cool.

                         DEAN
            When can you leave?

                         DAVID
            As soon as you want.

                         DEAN
            I want you to go right away, I
            think that's best. I also need you
            to check out a car for me down
            there that this guy is selling.

They walk towards a back room, as they do they pass a
REGULAR JOE who bumps into Dean accidentally, Dean explodes;

                         DEAN
            You wanna fuck around, asshole? You
            wanna get tough, wanna see me kick
            some motherfuck around here?

                         REGULAR JOE
            Take it easy, man, relax. Don't --
                         DEAN
            I'll relax your fucking head --
            this is my personal space, man,
            this is my personal fucking space,
            you don't violate that, you don't
            do that.

                         REGULAR JOE
            I've got a glass in my hand why
            don't you chill out?

                         DEAN
            You've got a glass?

Dean takes a BEER BOTTLE and SMASHES it in half on the bar,
holds it up to the guy --

                         DEAN
            YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A GLASS, NOW I'VE
            GOT A GLASS. I'VE GOT A GLASS TOO
            MOTHERFUCK.

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - MOMENTS LATER

They're all walking towards a back room of the bar, they
walk past a COUPLE that is fighting. The WOMAN is screaming
at the top of her lungs at the MAN;

                         WOMAN
            I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL FUCKING
            CRUSH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

Dean gets in the middle of it;

                         DEAN
            Take it easy, take it easy you guys
            in here, I need to talk to you
            later, Tommy -- I wanna know if you
            wanna book the boys --

He motions over his shoulder to Ashes to Ashes.

                         MAN
            I'll talk to you later.

                         WOMAN
            YOU WON'T FUCKIN' TALK TO HIM
            LATER, I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL
            CRUSH YOU, ASSHOLE.

                                            CUT TO:
INT. DEAN'S OFFICE/UPSTAIRS/BACKROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They enter into an upstairs office area. It has a couple
desks and off to the side, in a small, partitioned off room
is The Phone Sex Area; a GIRL on the phone. (We hear bits of
her call, e.g. "Me? I'm in Florida. Laying on my bed.")

There are posters for Ashes to Ashes, filing cabinets,
posters of CARS, lots of various small business items like
order forms and pamphlets, etc. Dean collects a piece of
paper and hands it to David/Nate/Jim;

                         DEAN
            Your expenses are your own.

                         DAVID
            I thought Latisha said you would --

                         DEAN
            -- she didn't know what she was
            talking about --

                         DAVID
            It's....whatever....that's not cool.

                         DEAN
            David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It
            doesn't make sense if you think
            about it in a fair deal like sense.
            Ok? It's business. Seriously. One
            hundred dollars for two days work
            is a lot more than your family is
            making sitting around your house.
            I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now.
            Just stop.

He hands him a set of KEYS and goes through the info;

                         DEAN
            ...keys for the track. You have to
            gas it up and save the receipts on
            that. His address. We have a
            business address too if you need
            that -- but hit him at his house
            first, see what this little bad boy
            is all about and shake him up --
            give him a little doe-see-doe --

                         LATISHA
            Uch. Shut up, Dean.

                         DEAN
            What's the problem?

                         LATISHA
            You don't need to talk all macho,
            "shake him out, little bad boy."
            Whatever -- you're not an action
            hero, tough guy, you're not a
            gangster --

He makes a very SUDDEN AND QUICK MOVE towards her and she
FLINCHES.

                         DEAN
            Flinchy. That's what I thought.
            Shut up.
                   (to Greg)
            Call me when you see this guy --
            check him out see what's what. She
            asked him for seven fifty when she
            was on the phone with him, so --
            just call me when you get there.

He hands him another piece of paper and a photo;

                         DEAN
            This is this place called Ace
            Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't
            know exactly where this is and I
            don't understand these maps so just
            go there and check it out. It's a
            '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says
            is fine, but I need to figure out
            why he's only asking 23 for it. So
            take a look, the whole thing, call
            me about that, if it seems alright
            then I'll head down there and check
            it out.

                         DAVID
            Ok.

                         DEAN
            That's it.

                         DAVID
            Can we maybe ask for more money on
            this?

                         LATISHA
            Why?

                         DAVID
            ...because it's California? I mean
            it's like a nine or ten hour drive.
            It's not like going to Salt Lake
            and getting the Mormon's, it's
            different...

After a long, long staring contest with David, Dean SUDDENLY
AND VERY VIOLENTLY PUTS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WALL....then
turns to David......Latisha rolls her eyes. David, Nate and
Jim leave.

EXT/INT. LENA'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - EVENING

This is a SPLIT SCREEN SEQUENCE shot with TWO CAMERAS.

THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN holds Lena. She waits in her
small, nondescript apartment doing the things you do while
waiting for someone else. She sits, stands, sits, stands....

THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE THE SCREEN travels (STEADICAM) with
Barry as he walks into the RECEPTION AREA. There is a
SECURITY GUARD (black, female) who asks him his name, where
he's going and to sign in. The Security Guard calls up to
Lena's place....

....and we watch Lena answer the phone....

...The Security Guard gives Barry some very complicated
directions....we follow/lead Barry as he makes his way
through the maze/up elevators/down corridors looking for
Lena's apartment.....Finally, he arrives, knocks;

                         LENA
            Who is it?

                         BARRY
            It's Barry.

As she opens the door, THE SPLIT SCREEN SLIDES AWAY AND THE
IMAGES GIVE WAY TO THE ONE OF LENA standing;

                         LENA
            Hi.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lena and Barry at a table. They talk (see notes.)

                         LENA
            So I want to tell you something, I
            gotta tell you: I saw a picture of
            you guys, your sisters and you and
            I saw your picture and I really
            wanted to meet you.
                   (beat)
            I came to drop my car off there on
            purpose, to try and meet you.

Barry leans a little bit out of FRAME.

                         BARRY
            ...really? That's nice...are you
            lying?

                         LENA
            ...I thought I should tell you. I
            didn't want to get too far along on
            going out and be hiding something --

BEAT. He leans slightly back in FRAME.

                         BARRY
            That's very nice. Thank you. Thank
            you for saying that.
                   (beat)
            You're friends with my sister?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            How long have you known her?

                         LENA
            About six months.

                         BARRY
            You like her?

                         LENA
            Yeah. Yeah we get along well.
                   (beat)
            You didn't get along with her very
            well?

                         BARRY
            Did you really come to meet me on
            purpose or are you lying about that?

                         LENA
            No, no. I did.

                         BARRY
            That's nice. It's nice.
                   (beat)
            I've been looking around a lot
            lately at promotional giveaways,
            cross promotional work by some
            companies. Do you remember all that
            pudding?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So that pudding was bought, I
            bought that pudding because of a
            pretty interesting promotion that's
            sponsored by Healthy Choice and
            American Airlines. It's designed to
            encourage airline travel and
            obviously designed to encourage
            buying Healthy Choice products.
            They make frozen meals, deli meats,
            pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
            creams, this sort of thing.....

                         LENA
            Yeah?

                         BARRY
            ....I'm sorry....I lost my
            thoughts, what I was saying....

                         LENA
            You were talking about the
            promotion --

                         BARRY
            -- the promotion says: buy any 10
            Healthy Choice products and get 500
            miles of airline travel or 1,000
            for purchases made with a special
            coupon. So in the supermarket, you
            notice their products, first you
            notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken
            Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty
            good deal....but then I noticed
            they had soup at 89 cents a
            can.....and you start to do the
            math and you start to notice that
            it's a really amazing deal because
            I stumbled across the pudding at 25
            cents a cup. Now the crucial thing
            is the bar codes on the label.
            That's those little bar codes, you
            know? The universal product codes?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That's what's used to redeem the
            mileage, so in noticing the
            pudding, each cup had an individual
            bar code -- in other words: Two
            dollars and fifty cents for ten
            cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
            in the coupon: it's one thousand.
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah, no, I see --

                         BARRY
            You see if you spent $3,000 dollars
            on pudding you could earn over one
            million frequent flyer miles.

                         LENA
            That's insane. That is really,
            really crazy. That's just crazy if
            you spend three thousand dollars on
            pudding.

                         BARRY
            ....yeah....

                         LENA
            So that was your pudding?

                         BARRY
            ....No....

                         LENA
            I'm sorry. I thought you said --

                         BARRY
            No I didn't say that.

                         LENA
            I thought you said you bought all
            that pudding --

                         BARRY
            My friend Carlos is doing it who
            works with me. It's his. It's his
            pudding, he's doing it. It's not
            mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
            do it. He's the one who's insane.
            He only spent about one hundred
            dollars so far though --

                         LENA
            Your sister was telling me a pretty
            funny story about you, when you
            guys were kids and you were
            building a ramp for your dog and
            you threw a hammer through a window?
            Is that right? You threw a hammer
            through a sliding glass door?

Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very
quickly, holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his
nose, and then he smiles;

                         BARRY
            I don't remember that, she might be
            lying. I have to go the bathroom.

He gets up and goes.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Barry walks in and goes a little crazy. He's mad at himself
and he HITS a stall....it seems loose already and falls
straight to the floor.

This makes him go crazier and he continues to BEAT and KICK
the shit out of the bathroom/stall.

HOLD. He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks
around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he
exits....

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RESTARAUNT - MOMENTS LATER

Barry comes back and sits down, seems a little better. Tries
to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before: the
MANAGER comes over, leans in carefully;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         LENA & BARRY
            Hi.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, can I talk to you?

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Just have you for one second, please.

He looks to Lena, excuses himself.

ANGLE, OFF TO THE SIDE.
The Manager and Barry step away, in a quiet section of the
restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto; SLOW ZOOM IN.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         MANAGER
            Did you do it?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            You didn't just smash up the bathroom?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            Well who did?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         MANAGER
            You're hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I cut myself.

                         MANAGER
            How?

                         BARRY
            On my knife.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, a young man saw you coming out
            of the bathroom.

                         BARRY
            I didn't do that.

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            Why? ...what?

                         MANAGER
            Your hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Sir, I have no way of proving that
            you demolished the bathroom --

                         BARRY
            I didn't do it.

                         MANAGER
            Alright, well you're gonna have to
            leave. You're gonna have to go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna call the police then, sir.

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this to me.

                         MANAGER
            The police are on their way.

                         BARRY
            Sorry.

He starts to move back....

                         BARRY
            Can I pay you here? Can I pay you
            for our drinks and salad?

                         MANAGER
            That's fine.

Barry takes out some money and hands it over.

                         BARRY
            Keep the change, please.

ANGLE, BACK AT THE TABLE.
They walk back to the table and Barry whispers down to her,
very close, STEADICAM (leads them out - continuous)

                         BARRY
            We should go I think, I don't like
            it here.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They head out of the restaraunt.

                         LENA
            Is everything ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         LENA
            What happened?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

                         LENA
            What did he want?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

They walk a bit.

                         BARRY
            I have a better idea of where we
            can go.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They walk some more.

                         BARRY
            There's a better place for us to eat.

                         LENA
            Did something happen; are you alright?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok.
            It's fine. Everything is fine.

They walk some more and get in the car.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

75mm OVER ONTO BARRY. 75mm OVER ONTO LENA. Rear process or
poor man's process.

                         LENA
            So....how is your harmonium doing?

Barry looks at her......

                         LENA
            Your portable reed organ....the piano.

                         BARRY
            Well, it's fine. Thank you.

                         LENA
            Did you pick it up from the street?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         LENA
            Did you take it from the street in
            front of your work?

                         BARRY
            ...yes I did...?

                         LENA
            Are you learning how to play it?

                         BARRY
            Yes? I'm trying.

                         LENA
            Oh that's great.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            So you must travel a lot with all
            that pudding you bought?

                         BARRY
            Yes no not really.

INT. LENA'S APARTMENT - LATER

Lena and Barry finishing up the date;

                         BARRY
            Ok....well...I'm gonna go.

                         LENA
            ...yeah...

                         BARRY
            It was nice to see you again, to
            see your face again, to go out with
            you --

                         LENA
            I'll be around and back in town in
            a few days --

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         LENA
            If you come to Hawaii --

                         BARRY
            Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about
            that.

                         LENA
            You don't think you'll go --

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Ok. Well call me when you get back,
            I mean, I'll call you when I get
            back. I'll be back for three weeks
            and then I go away for a month
            after that. So maybe in that time....

                         BARRY
            Ok. Have a good trip.

They do a shake hands/kiss on cheek goodbye.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RECEPTION AREA/LENA'S BUILDING

Barry steps out of the elevator and walks to the exit,
passing a RECEPTION DESK WOMAN.....we hear the PHONE
RINGING......she calls out;

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            Are you Barry?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            It's for you.

Barry walks towards the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         LENA (OC)
            This is Lena.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA (OC)
            I just wanted you to know, wherever
            you're going or whatever you're
            doing right now I want you to know
            that I wanted to kiss you just then.

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So what do I do then?

INT. MAZE OF CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

Barry is walking up and around, looking for the spot. Two or
three shots of various, him getting a little/slightly
lost.....running/walking....

                                            CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA pushes down towards him as he walks towards the door.
He knocks, she opens up, CAMERA SLIDES right in and lands as
they KISS and then the kiss turns into a small hug and then
they talk, real close. HOLD.

                         BARRY
            That was good.

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I'll see you later.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            I don't freak out very often.

                         LENA
            What do you mean?

                         BARRY
            I don't, no matter what my sisters
            say, ok?

                         LENA
            ...I don't know what you mean....

                         BARRY
            I don't freak out.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY

ANGLE, BEHIND THE CAR. Brake lights turned off, Barry steps
out.

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA on Barry's trash can, the kitchen light comes
on....SLOW PUSH IN....He enters FRAME and lifts the trash
bag out.

EXT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

CAMERA is behind Barry now in a new location....he's walking
from his garage where he's just parked his car over to his
garbage area as he throws something out...

....he looks up and sees... Jim and Nate driving the Toyota
Pick Up Truck...he cruises past slowly....keeps going....then
makes a u-turn...Barry turns around and DAVID and MIKE D are
right there...

                         DAVID
            Hey.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         DAVID
            I need to talk to you for a second.

                         BARRY
            What?

                         DAVID
            You gotta give me some money.

Barry starts to walk away....David walks alongside him,
casually.....Barry looks over and sees the car has pulled
up....

                         DAVID
            You made a phone call and you said
            you'd help a girl out and then you
            didn't....I'm here to get the money.

                         BARRY
            Wait a minute --

                         DAVID
            No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't
            make it a thing --

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this.

                         DAVID
            It's just you need to give me the
            money...do you have it right now?

MIKE D violently PUSHES BARRY STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND.

                         BARRY
            Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't
            please....

                         DAVID
            How much money do you have in your
            pockets?

                         BARRY
            Just take it, take the money in my
            pockets, take it, it's fine --

They grab the money from his pockets as they hold him down
on the ground;

                         BARRY
            It's three hundred and twenty
            dollars, just take it.

                         DAVID
            What do you have in the house?

                         BARRY
            Nothing....I mean, really...change,
            nothing....that's the cash I have....

                         DAVID
            You have an ATM?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         DAVID
            Is this where you live?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         DAVID
            You have another house somewhere or
            something?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MIKE D
            This is three hundred and twenty.
            Let's just go to your ATM and
            that'll be it --

                         BARRY
            I didn't promise her money. She
            said that it was confidential, this
            isn't fair --

Mike D pushes Barry's face.

                         MIKE D

            Lena Leonard and there shouldn't be
            a man in the room I'm calling.

                         BARRY
            That's not true. That's not true at
            all. You said that your name was
            Georgia and you said our
            conversation was confidential and I
            trusted you and you kept calling
            and asking me for money, c'mon now
            I want to talk to your owner, your
            supervisor, whoever runs this, you
            understand. Please connect me now.

                         LATISHA
            Can you hang on a second?

She puts him on hold and dials another number, she's real
nervous, holding it in --

INT. DEAN'S MATTRESS/FURNITURE STORE - THAT MOMENT

Dean also seems to own a mattress/furniture store in Provo.
Somebody walks towards him, says:

                         WORKER
            Dean, line one....

Dean walks back to the phone and picks it up;

                         DEAN
            Hello?

                         LATISHA
            Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A.,
            Barry Egan is calling on the other
            line and saying all this stuff, he
            wants to talk to a supervisor or
            whatever --

                         DEAN
            What did you say?

                         LATISHA
            Nothing.

                         DEAN
            Put him through.

                         LATISHA
            No, no. This is bad, something
            might have happened, we should
            just --

                         DEAN
            Shut up, just put him on the phone,
            it doesn't matter, just shut up --

INTERCUT NOW WITH BARRY/LATISHA/DEAN; She clicks over to him;

                         LATISHA
            Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you
            through to my supervisor.

                         BARRY
            Fine, thank you.

                         LATISHA
            Ok. You're connected.

                         DEAN
            Who is this?

                         BARRY
            Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I
            called your service --

                         DEAN
            Why don't you shut the fuck up?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         DEAN
            I said calm down and shut the fuck
            up. What's your problem?

                         BARRY
            I haven't even told you what's
            happened. Your girl that you have
            that works there for you threatened
            me and two men just chased me --
            extorted money --
                         DEAN
            Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't
            have anything to do with me - this
            is a legitimate bossiness.

                         BARRY
            YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK
            YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY
            LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM
            IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU
            AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT.
            YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.

                         DEAN
            CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM
            DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --

They stop screaming. Then:

                         DEAN
            Now are you threatening me, dick?

                         BARRY
            You are bad. You are a bad person.
            you are a bad person and you have
            no right to take people's confidence
            in your service --

                         DEAN
            You better watch your mouth, cunt,
            you're gonna get hurt.

                         BARRY
            NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.

                         DEAN
            I'll say whatever I want --

                         BARRY
            YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE
            I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER.
            YOU HURT HER.

                         DEAN
            You just told me to fuck off. That
            wasn't good. You're dead.

Dean hangs up the phone.

ANGLE, BARRY. He turns away and walks quickly out of his
office with the phone receiver to his ear.....the base of
the phone slides off the desk.....and then the receiver RIPS
from the base and he starts to run....

            In the back.....

Barry walks towards the back.....he rounds a corner....to
reveal:

DEAN is in a back room, he's getting his hair cut by
LATISHA.....he turns and looks at Barry, who stands there
with the phone in his hand.

They stare at each other.

                         BARRY
            I'm a nice and reasonable man. I
            didn't do anything wrong. Please
            don't make me hurt you. And I'm
            telling you: that if you ever hurt
            me or if you hurt someone that I
            love.....I will hurt you many,
            many, many times over.....because
            it's not right to take people's trust.

                         DEAN
            You came all the way from Los
            Angeles to tell me that?

                         BARRY
            Yes I did.

Dean doesn't respond.

                         BARRY
            Can we agree that that is that?

                         DEAN
            That's that.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

Barry hands him the phone.

Barry exits.....as he's about to go out the doors, Dean
screams;

                         DEAN

REAL GENIUS
 

 
 

 

 


 REAL GENIUS EXT. SKY-DAY A Black B-1 Bomber banks steeply exposing its underside to us. MAN (V.O./FILTERED) Slingshot this is Watchdog. Rabbit's home. Rolling out of its bank, the bomber begins a steep climb revealing the fact that it is carrying a small delta winged shuttle on it back. The bomber's wings slide back. BOMBER PILOT (V.O./FILTERED) Roger watchdog. Understand we are go for crossbow. Suddenly a rocket engine on the back of the modified bomber fires thrusting the plane into steep climb. INT. B-1 FLIGHT DECK-DAY THE PLANE VIBRATES. The pilot and co-pilot are busy in their seats. Behind them sits a third pilot wearing a space suit. He gives them a thumbs-up signal, rises and crawls to the rear. BOMBER PILOT (into the mike/ over the roar) Watchdog, Slingshot. let us know when the rabbit's in the hole. EXT. A CROWD-DAY A blond haired, blue-eyed man with a small walkie-talkie is standing in the midst of a group of cheering Central American peasants and townsfolk. He is disguised as one of them. ANGLE ON VILLA BALCONY The uniformed President of this formerly sleepy, now strategically critical nation is waving to his people. He is flanked by military guards. He turns and walks into the villa. EXT. B-1 BOMBER-DAY The bomber approaches the top of it's arc. ATHERTON The shuttle pilot climbs into his seat, straps in and checks his instruments. SHUTTLE PILOT All systems check. Crossbow is armed. BOMBER PILOT (V.O.) Roger, Ignition sequence, start, separation in five... EXT. TOP OF THE BOMBER The explosive bolts blow on the shuttle mount. INT. BOMBER FLIGHT DECK The pilot pushes his yolk forward. EXT. BOMBER As the bomber falls way, the shuttle's booster ignites with a roar, thrusting it toward space. EXT. SPACE-LOOKING BACK We see a tiny glowing speck coming towards us. very quickly it gains in altitude and we see that it is the shuttle. Suddenly it is upon us and blasts over our heads. ANGLE FROM BEHIND We follow the shuttle. The engine stops. There is a small explosion, which pushes the booster rocket away. Small maneuvering rockets fire and the shuttle establishes itself in a nose down altitude. SHUTTLE PILOT (V.O. FILTERED) Crossbow is established. BOMBER PILOT (V.O./FILTERED) Roger, we have ground confirmation. Reference grid seven. Check pathfinder, on. SHUTTLE PILOT (V.O. FILTERED) Roger, I'm going on the scope. Moving Target Indicator, engage. Behind and above the cockpit a large hatch opens and a large circular spinning mirror rises and locks into position. INT. SHUTTLE The pilot reaches above him and pulls down a viewfinder and begins looking through it. EXT. THE SHUTTLE. A target sighting lens moves from right to left, stops, and then moves back but this time with the mirror moving in unison. INT. THE SHUTTLE While still looking through the viewfinder, the pilot manipulates the targeting controls. INSERT PILOT'S POV OF THE SCREEN Crosshairs, a grid patter and digital, rangefinder readouts appear over various parts of the Earth's topography as the pilot searches for his target. Then it steadies on a polarized image of a group of people. One of the images seems to stand out brighter than the others. EXT. VILLA PATIO-DAY The president and his aide are chatting with a group of visiting dignitaries. There is a jovial atmosphere as they order drinks from a waiter. The president is proudly displaying one of his medals to his guests. it has a very unique jewel-like object in its middle. INT. THE SHUTTLE The pilot is watching through the viewfinder. PILOT (into mike) Scanner on. Target locked. Tracking locked. EXT. THE SHUTTLE The mirror and sighting lens adjust as they track the target. EXT. VILLA PATIO The President is served a cup of coffee. He asks the waiter for sugar. The waiter turns back to his cart. INT. THE SHUTTLE The pilot puts his hands on the joysticks and flips open the trigger covers. PILOT Nice and easy does it. EXT. THE SHUTTLE Dead silence, then the mirror erupts in brilliant light and sends an incredibly bright beam toward the Earth. Behind the shuttle we see exhaust gases venting in giant plumes into space. EXT. VILLA PATIO The beam strikes the president like the finger of god. He vaporizes. The waiter turns back with the asked-for sugar to find a smoking hole where the President once stood. EXT. SPACE The shuttle finishes its work and the beam shuts down. The mirror folds away and the shuttle arcs across the screen preparing for re-entry, firing small retro rockets. PILOT (V.O) I'm coming home. Just like shooting ducks in a barrel. PULL BACK TO REVEAL INT. A HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ROOM-NO WINDOWS A large screen at one end of the room continues to show the re-entry. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The Crossbow Project. There's no defense like a good offense. In the middle of the room is a giant donut of a round conference table. Another circle hangs above and casts light downward in such a way as to light the table-top but caser those sitting around it in shadow. We can see them but not well. There are SIX MEN in suits. The look is sinister as Hell; but the talk is for Rotary Club meeting. A MAN, sitting at three o'clock, wearing an Air force major's uniform, points at a remote control device at the screen and stops the film. The lighting does not change. he turns to the man sitting at twelve o'clock. CARMICHAEL Nice little weapon isn't it, Dave? DECKER Well, I guess so, but gosh, Don, it's a movie. You want me to start buying weapons from George Lucas? Polite laughter all around. CARMICHAEL Now that would be somethin', wouldn't it? DECKER Well, sometimes I think I might as well. (to one of the others) What do you think of what you saw, Roy? ROY I think there weren't enough girls. More polite laughter. Then Roy turns ice cold in a flash. ROY (cont'd) Is this thing for biological targets only? CARMICHAEL No, Sir, this thing would take the skin right off, of Air Force One if you wanted. Not that I'm saying we'd ever want to kill our own President, but, you know, for example. ROY Our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless for warfare. DECKER It's not intended for use in your kind of warfare, Roy. This is a perfect peace time weapon. ROY What's the kill potential? CARMICHAEL As soon as the size-to power ratio is licked we'll have about seven bangs for the buck. ROY When that? Carmichael shrugs the sign for "who knows?" DECKER Seriously, Don, I have to report to the Secretary that everything's on schedule. We have plans for your little ray's gun this summer. CARMICHAEL (Trying to cover) As I understand it, guys, there's some major practical difficulties. I'm pushing as hard as I can. DECKER Well, Don, you tell those geniuses you've got until the end of the next fiscal quarter to come up with a working model or I'm pulling the plug on the funding. CARMICHAEL (very nervous) I'm assured they're on the verge of a major breakthrough. DECKER Good. Just as long as we get a working weapon out of it by June. Right, general? ROY I wouldn't know, Dave. I haven't had a working weapon since Korea. DECKER Right. (to assistant) Larry, let's see the film on blinding techniques, then we'll have some lunch, all right? INT. EXHIBITION HALL -DAY WE OPEN on a sign: "Effects of marijuana on Rodents." A cage is divided in half. One side is marked "NO Marijuana." A chinchilla is running furiously on a treadmill. The other side is marked "Marijuana." A chinchilla is lying in a little hammock. DOLLY BACK TO WIDE SHOT. We see we are in a large hall. There are dozens of booths and exhibits. A banner strung across the hall lets us know that this is the "WESTERN REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL WINTER SCIENCE FAIR." ANGLE ON a pretty female student at a booth standing in front of a clear glass cylinder that has vacuum hoses connected to it. There are two colored gases inside the cylinder. A sign behind her says: HOW TORNADOS ARE FORMED." A small group of boys stand watching her in as sexist a way as possible. GIRL It doesn't seem to be working; but if it was, these gases would be going around. A BOY We don't care. ANGLE ON another part of the hall. Two blond-haired, male twins stand proudly in their booth. "THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF HEAVENLY BODIES." A large, crudely painted diorama of the Milky Way is in the background. Several painted balls are suspended in front, labeled "Mercury," "Venus," etc. The sun is represented by a large electromagnet. All the "planets" ANGLE ON a booth near the entrance. A ROBOT attracts a crowd. It has a video screen for a face which reads: "Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age." With jerky motions he extends his mechanical arms and shakes hands with passersby. He is speaking to a small KID. HARRY Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age...midget mutant; weight... The kid shoots it in the neck with a toy space gun. The ROBOT SHORT CIRCUITS: sparks shoot out, its arms fly in circles until a FUSE BLOWS and it SIZZLES to a burning stop. WE PAN OVER TO the door just in time to see the entrance of DR. JERRY ATHERTON, professor of physics at Pacific Tech, and a popular host of a PBS television show about science. His manner and bearing mark him as a classic anal retentive. He is a perfect cross between Carl Sagan and Jerry Brown. Brilliant, intense, seemingly sincere but, in fact, incredibly manipulative. There is an intentional aura of superiority surrounding him. We FOLLOW him in and down an aisle where he draws the attention of the crowd in the manner of the celebrity he is. An OLD LADY stops him. He beams a smile at her. OLD LADY Are you Dr. Atherton? ATHERTON Yes, dear. OLD LADY I just love your television show. ATHERTON Well, thank you. We try. OLD LADY What's Albert Einstein really like? ATHERTON Dead. OLD LADY Oh, I thought you had him on. ATHERTON No, that was just an actor. OLD LADY Is everyone an actor, then? ATHERTON (beginning to tire of this) No, I'm a physicist. OLD LADY But Einstein isn't? ATHERTON (dismissing her) Nice talking to you. He walks away. ANGLE ON a booth where we meet MITCH SIMON, aged fifteen. Mitch is a genius. He's known that since he was old enough to understand the word, which was on his first birthday. He was doing college level work by the time he was in the fourth grade. Although he's intellectually precocious, he's still only 15 years old and has all the problems of any average adolescent. His shyness and intellect have always made him feel different and uncomfortable in social situations. He stands with his PARENTS near a demonstration table. Unlike some of the other exhibits we've seen, there is nothing amateurish about this one. In fact, it is an impressive display of a dye laser. We can see the beams of multi-colored rays bouncing between mirrors, moving through liquids, combining with gases. MITCH is trying to explain his work to MR. SIMON, who is a nice enough guy but who pretty much regards the fact that his son is gifted as a pain in the butt. MITCH See, Dad, it's coherent light. MR. SIMON It talks? MITCH No. ATHERTON APPROACHES. He is seen by MRS. SIMON, who greets him. MRS. SIMON Dr. ATHERTON, what a surprise. ATHERTON Hello, Mrs. Simon. How are you? MR. SIMON No problem with Mitch's test scores or anything, is there? ATHERTON No, no. I just thought I'd stop by, bring you the good news myself. I just got word from the admissions committee. We did it. Mitch is in. MRS. SIMON Isn't that wonderful. ATHERTON (to Mitch) Hello, Mitch. MITCH (shyly) Hi. ATHERTON Nice little display? MITCH Thanks ATHERTON What's your medium? MITCH Just Argon. But I have it all structured for HF if I could get some. ATHERTON That would be interesting. MITCH It's all theoretical at this stage, but I have the power supply completely worked out. ATHERTON Very nice. MITCH (a kid again) Thanks. ATHERTON turns to Mitch's parents. ATHERTON You must be very proud. he's the first student we've ever accepted for winter term entrance at Pacific Tech. MR. SIMON I image he's the youngest, too. ATHERTON No, actually. The youngest we've had was a twelve, but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we don't really count him. MRS. SIMON (almost in tears) Fifteen year old and off to college. Image. MR. SIMON Listen Doc. This scholarship thing, does he get any kind of whatya call it, signing bonus sort of thing? ATHERTON (hoping this is not going to be a problem) Well, no...but by allowing Mitch to progress at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential. Don't you agree? MR. SIMON Yeah, I guess. It's just that athletes get, you know, cars and stuff. ATHERTON (polite for Mitch's sake) Well, I guess we scientists are a little different than athletes. MR. SIMON Cheaper. ATHERTON Smarter MR. SIMON Not when it comes to getting cars. MRS. SIMON We just want the best for Mitchie. (changing gears) Dr. Atherton, I saw your show the other night, about radioactive isotopes, and I have a question for you. ATHERTON Oh, yes? MRS. SIMON Is that your real hair? MR. SIMON Well, I wondered that, too. ATHERTON (struggling for manners) Well, interesting question, when you consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is "real" or actually just an "image" being broadcast. MR. SIMON Didn't look real. Anyway, listen, I got to get something to eat or I'm gonna die. MRS. SIMON Come on, let's look for something. They start away. MRS. SIMON (cont'd) I saw over there one of the kids was doing an experiment with insect protein. MR. SIMON Did you see anyone doing anything with corned beef? They exit. ATHERTON Your parents... MITCH Yes? ATHERTON They're...nice MITCH They're Okay. They just sometimes don't have any idea of what I'm talking about. ATHERTON I'm sure of that. Afraid you're going to miss your friends? MITCH No. I don't have any. I think I intimidate other kids. ATHERTON Good boy. MITCH I don't want to. ATHERTON Remember, compared to you, most people have the IQ of a carrot. We're different than most people, Mitch, but you should be proud of that. I mean, look around. From now on, you'll BE amongst peers, colleagues. I suppose I might as well tell you now, I've put you on my personal research team. Some of the finest minds on campus, not the least of which is, of course, my own. MITCH It sounds great. ATHERTON Well, now, I'm expecting great things from you, my boy. This is only the second time I've given this honor to a freshman. The first was... MITCH Chris Kinsley. ATHERTON You know Chris? MITCH No, but he's a legend in the Physics Club. ATHERTON Well, you're going to become a legend yourself. You'll be working with Chris. He's a senior now but he's still on the team and still as brilliant as ever. MITCH Wow. INT. PACIFIC ELECTRONICS INSTRUMENTS-DAY We see CHRIS KINSLEY, Chris has on his head a pair of those jiggling antennae-like things. WE PULL BACK to revel that he is on a tour of the facilities. A huge hanger-like room filled with workers constructing and assembling scientific instruments. This place has the look and feel of the Big Time. Workers put the finishing touches on a communication SATELLITE. Passing through this Disneyland of Science is a well-dressed executive. ROBERT JENSEN, who is guiding Chris on the tour. Chris was heralded as one of the smartest people to ever enter Pacific Tech. He proved to be even smarter than many of his professors. He also proved to be one of the most outrageous people to ever enter Pacific Tech. his antics are legend. Unimpressed with authority, pomposity and bullshit in general., Chris dresses on the sloppy side of life. Currently he's wearing a sports jacket that's seen better days, over a faded sweatshirt that has the logo "I ? Toxic Waste." They approach a second executive/scientist, MIKE DODD, who is wearing a lab coat, and a beautiful public relations executive named SHERRY NUGIL, who is also wearing a lab coat but in a whole new way. JENSEN (as they approach the couple) Guys, I want you to meet Chris Kinsley. Chris, this is Sherry Nugil, my assistant, and Mike Dodd. CHRIS Dr. Dodd? JENSEN He's the man who just designed the new Telcom Satellite here. CHRIS I know. Nice to meet you Dr. Dodd. Isn't the Telcom raining debris all over Europe? DODD (smiling, but angry) That was a launch problem, not a design problem. Why are you wearing that toy on your head? Chris takes the thing from his head. CHRIS Oh, this. Sorry, I was worried that people would think I was stuffy, You know, no fun; all brain, no penis, JENSEN Pardon? CHRIS I'm sorry, it's just an infantile response to authority. JENSEN (confused) Yes. you are Chris Kinsley, aren't you? CHRIS No. Well, yes. I mean, I used to be. Now I'm Mhavishnue Kinsley. JENSEN (relieved) I see. You are being funny. CHRIS Well, I just can't help it. You're such a fun guy yourself. JENSEN Oh yes. I think you'll find we all are, right Mike? DODD No. JENSEN Now Chris, Sherry is going to show you around the place. She can answer any questions you might have about fringe benefits or dress codes or anything and I'll see you back upstairs when you're done, okay? Sherry, take good care of this young man. He's one of the ten finest minds kin the country. CHRIS Someday I hope to be two of them. JENSEN See you later. Jensen and Dodd exit. CHRIS You are very beautiful. SHERRY You don't act like one of the top ten minds in America. CHRIS Oh, really? How many of them have you met? SHERRY (with a really dirty look in her eye) Seven. CHRIS Really? SHERRY You'll be eight. Six was Professor Hostetler at M.I.T. CHRIS Old Professor Hostetler? Isn't he dead? SHERRY He is now. INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PEI FACILITY- ALITTLE LATER Sherry and Chris stare intently into one another's eyes. SHERRY And so, coupled with full insurance coverage and bonus plans, you find it adding up to a fairly sizable perks package. CHRIS I have a pretty sizable perks package right now. SHERRY Also, we understand that you people don't care too much for rigid timetables, and that's pretty rare in private industry. CHRIS So are you. SHERRY Is it true that school of yours keeps getting smarter and smarter kids every year? CHRIS Yup! I mean no! INT. YET ANOTHER PART OF PEI- A LITTLE LATER. SHERRY You see the funding associations are the same. Our theoretical work is in the Blue Sky sector as well. CHRIS You have no idea how much I need that kind of continuity in my life right now. INT. CATWALK ABOVE A HUGH LAB- A LITTLE LATER STILL SHERRY You just belong here, Chris. We have several of Dr. Atherton's former students and they're all doing quite well with us. CHRIS What number was he? SHERRY Two. One of his other students was four. CHRIS You're wonderful. SHERRY I know. CHRIS Can we go somewhere? SHERRY Yes. EXT. ROOF OF HANGER-DUSK The giant dish of a huge radio telescope faces heavens. SHERRY (O.C) (between kisses) Talk smart to me. CHRIS (O.C.) What? ANGLE ON CHRIS AND SHERRY They are lying in the middle of the dish. Passion mounts, fingers cope with belts and buttons, clothing falls away; my god, these people are having sex. SHERRY Please I need it. What was your favorite course? CHRIS I guess right now I'd have to say Fluid Mechanics. SHERRY Oooooooooh... CHRIS (responding to something interesting Sherry just did with her hips) And Gym. SHERRY Please. CHRIS Sorry. SHERRY What's your research with Artherton? CHRIS Ultra-high power laser as an energy force for fusion. Tremendous boon to all mankind. And womankind, too. SHERRY Fusion, more fusion. CHRIS It's the process for obtaining enormous amounts of energy from forms of hydrogen, like Deuterium and Tritium. SHERRY Oh, my God, more. CHRIS Extracting the fuels is no problem. SHERRY Hmmmm. CHRIS Getting them to combine and release the energy is the problem. SHERRY Oohh, yes CHRIS It takes temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius. SHERRY Oh, God. CHRIS So, I'm... SHERRY Yes. CHRIS ...building... SHERRY Yes. CHRIS ...a laser... SHERRY Oh, yes. CHRIS ...that pulses... SHERRY Hmmmmmmmm. CHRIS ...very hot... SHERRY Ohhh... CHRIS ...and causes... SHERRY Yes. CHRIS ...Fusion... SHERRY Ahhhhhhhhhhh. EXT. PACIFIC TECH CAMPUS-DAY It is an impressive campus of older California Spanish building mixed with modern architectural marvels. This is the Sunday before the beginning of the Winter Term. We pick up MITCH SIMON and FOLLOW him as he crosses campus. He is wearing a tie and jacket, which only adds to his general sense of being out of place. He is carrying a map which he stops to consult every now and again. He stops an upper classman and asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older student takes great delight in turning the map right side up. EXT. PRESIDENT'S HOUSE-AFTERNOON The tasteful and elegant official residence of the university's President. DR. EUGENE MEREDITH. MITCH approaches the open front door, where he is greeted by MRS. MEREDITH. MITCH Good afternoon. I'm looking for (reading from the invitation in his hand) the President's Freshman Tea. MRS. MEREDITH. (leading him inside) Oh, good. I'm so glad we have one then. Who are you? INT. THE HOUSE-CONTINOUS They pass through on their way to the backyard. MITCH Mitch Simon. MRS. MEREDITH. Oh yes. You're the special case. I know Gene wants to meet you. You're just in time for his traditional talk. Would you like a glass of sherry? MITCH I'm a minor. MRS. MEREDITH. Aha, well of course you are. That would explain your height. They exit out onto the patio. EXT. THE PATIO AND GROUNDS OF THE HOUSE-CONTINUOUS The returning freshman class has gathered for a social. Mitch is the only one in a tie. He stands on the patio with Mrs. Meredith whose husband, the apparently ever-jovial professional academic administrator, is about to speak to the assembled. MEREDITH People, if I might get your attention. The din begins to quiet. MEREDITH (CONT'D) Welcome back, freshmen! I take it you all put the Christmas break to good use? There is good-natured jeering. MEREDITH (CONT'D) Now, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to speak seriously for a moment. You will recall that when I welcomed you to the Pacific institute of Technology a few short months ago I spoke of how we are one of the finest scientific institutions in the world. I think the finest. I mentioned our six Nobel Prize winners, our members of the national Academy of Sciences, and our members of the National Academy of Engineering. This is an intellectual oasis of technological achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost colleges and universities today. There is some applause and good-natured banter. Mitch is truly moved. This environment is exactly what Mitch has hoped for all his life. MEREDITH (CONT'D) I also spoke of the fact that you are the finest freshmen class we have ever had here. There are cheers and applause. MEREDITH (CONT'D) I say this to every freshman class. Each year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements. Almost jubilant cheering and clapping. MEREDITH (CONT'D) As you have no doubt already noticed by now, over a third of you are gone. By the end of the year another third of you will have followed them out of Eden and into mediocrity. The crowd goes deathly silent as Meredith continues in his cherry manner. MEREDITH (CONT'D) We want only the best. Hard work and high standards are expected of everyone. And if you aren't up to it Cal tech or M.I.T. might take you, but you don't fit in here. MEREDITH (CONT'D) Let me remind you that this place is an opportunity, not a right; a chance not a gift; a working lunch, not a picnic. Welcome back. Several waitresses begin serving tea but the despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse. Mitch stands waiting for the approaching Dr. Meredith. MRS. MEREDITH Gene, this is Mitch Simon. MEREDITH Oh, yes, Professor Artherton's bright star. MITCH Yes, sir. MEREDITH And I understand you're already on his project. I'm assured you're going to do great things. MITCH I hope so. MEREDITH Let me give you some advice. MITCH Thank you. MEREDITH Don't screw up. MITCH Okay. I guess I better go now. He walks away. MEREDITH (watching Mitch with satisfaction) I think the young people really appreciate my " getting down" verbally, don't you? MRS. MEREDITH Absolutely. EXT. CAMPUS-LATER Once again Mitch, map in hand, must ask another student for directions. This one also turns the map right-side up and then points to the building they are standing in front of. As he heads for it he passes a bronze bust of one of the founding fathers, DR. BRADFORD. The students have decorated him with a muffler, earmuffs and carrot nose to look like a snowman. INT. APPLIED PHYSICS BUILDING-MOMENTS LATER Mitch walks down a long corridor. He passes several open doors that reveal laboratories with all kinds of scientific equipment all over them. Mitch stops in front of a closed door. He checks the number, then looks down at a card in his hand. He turns the card right-side up. He OPENS the door to REVEAL a darkened lab. In the darkness there is a veritable light show of laser beams. A voice calls out from the darkness. VOICE (O.C.) Hey! MITCH Yes? VOICE (O.C.) Come in here. INT. LAB-CONTINUOUS Mitch ENTERS quickly and shuts the door behind himself. In the instrument glow we can make out the forms of three other students. They are: KENT, CARTER and BODIE, members of Dr. Atherton's research team. KENT Just leave the sandwiches and go. MITCH Me? KENT No, Yoda; yeah, you. MITCH I don't have any ah... CARTER Brains? MITCH No, sandwiches. KENT Well then, what good are you? CARTER What are we supposed to eat? MITCH (getting a little fed up) How about my shorts. KENT Hey! Who do you think you're talking to? The laser snaps off and the lights snap on. The glare is a little intense at first. KENT (CONT'D) Are you from the restaurant or not? With the lights on we get a chance to have a better look at the team. Kent is an elitist, intellectual snob with very little imagination who likes to think of himself as Atherton's protégé. He wears braces on his teeth because he knows how important a proper smile can be in the marketplace. MITCH No. I'm Mitch Simon. I'm a student. Dr. Atherton told me to come up here. KENT Oh, you're the new stud, are you. Or is it dud? MITCH How do you mean? BODIE Stud. Hot shot. Brain. You're the twelve-year-old, right? MITCH I'm fifteen. CARTER Does your body know that? Mitch attempts a good-natured laugh. It's not a great attempt. MITCH Are you expecting him or... KENT Sure. Can I get you something? A balloon? MITCH Are any of you guys Chris Kinsley? They all freeze. KENT No, Thank God. CARTER Hey Kent, I hear Kinsley got that PEI job all locked up. KENT Damn! I wanted that job. MITCH Why? KENT Why? Because it starts at fifty thousand a year, that's why. Plus travel, car, stock options... MITCH Oh. Well, I'm supposed to have a look at your work up to date. Check it over. KENT Check it over. MITCH Yes. KENT For what? MITCH Mistakes, I guess. He said you guys are stuck. The room goes rigid. Evidently this little punk of an upstart needs to be told what Christ died for. KENT Let's get something very clear here. Everything you've heard about the supportive student body and the honor code might hold for the rest of the campus, but it doesn't count for squat in here. Which means when jerry's not here, you do what I say. From God to Jerry to me, get it? Atherton ENTERS. KENT (CONT'D) Hi Jerry. ATHERTON I've told you before, Kent, you don't get to use my first name. KENT Did I? ATHERTON (to Mitch) Good to see you, Mitch. ATHERTON (CONT'D) (to the group) I'm sure you're all going to become fast friends. KENT We're well on our way already. ATHERTON Good, because after Mitch is brought up to date, I want the rest of you to take your cues from him. He'll be in charge of the group. KENT What? I mean, good choice, Jerry. ATHERTON You're doing it again, Kent. KENT Am I? ATHERTON Where's Chris? KENT He didn't bother to come in today. BODIE He said he didn't feel like it; and then I said 'you better'; and then he said ' or what?'; and then I said ' or he'd get the heck,' and then he said 'jam it, it's Sunday' and he looks for God on Sundays; so I said 'okay, but I'm telling.' ATHERTON Thank you Bodie. I notice you've stopped stuttering. BODIE Yes, I've been giving myself some sock treatment and it's working. ATHERTON Good. (to Mitch) I'm sorry he isn't here. I wanted you to meet your hero. CARTER Hero? That clown? Look at this. He points to a table full of laser equipment comprised of various angled mirrors and gas cambers and drib units. The others gather around it. CARTER (Cont'd) We heard he wasn't coming in. Kent and I figured we'd go ahead and run his section without him. And we started getting picosecond ratings that aren't even in the ballpark. KENT It looks like it'll take at least a week to re-do all this and start again. Mitch is carefully studying the equipment and checking some notes that were on the table. KENT (CONT'D) Another costly mistake. ATHERTON Are you sure? CARTER Positive. KENT Positive. MITCH (reading from notes) Negative. (innocently, to Carter and Kent) There's a mistake all right, but I think you guys made it. Look, you inverted the last two steps. CARTER (grabbing the notes) I don't make mistakes... (reading) ...Usually. ATHERTON Damnit, don't touch other people's things. MITCH (adjusting the equipment) This shouldn't take too long to fix. ATHERTON I'm glad that you were here, Mitch. KENT Yes, thanks for pointing out Carter's mistake, Mitch. ATHERTON Don't bother with that now. I'm sure you want to go get settled. MITCH (relieved) Well, it has been kind of a long day. Atherton starts to leave. ATHERTON Oh, I forgot Kent, I need your help. KENT Anything, Jerry. ATHERTON Stop it. KENT What? ATHERTON Get copies made of everything so young Mitch here can get started checking everything tomorrow. KENT My pleasure. ATHERTON And then, on your way back, stop at my cleaners. KENT Don't give it a thought. I enjoy it. ATHERTON (to Mitch) Shall we? MITCH Sure. Atherton exits, followed by Mitch. BODIE I guess it goes from God to Jerry to you to the cleaners, right Kent? EXT. DORM HALL- LATE AFTERNOON Mitch enters the arched column portico of this dormitory building. INT. ROOM The room is small, cramped, and more than a little disheveled. PEI, NASA and science fiction posters hang on the ceiling and wall, over and around one of the two beds. Junk food and soft drink containers are littered everywhere. In one corner is a fully-stocked Frito Lay Chip display. Mitch crosses to his bed and sits. He is exhausted and depressed. The door opens and Mitch see a strange, tall, bulkily- built, hermit-looking kind of a guy enter. He is carrying a McDonald's bag. He stops when he see Mitch and stares at him in a quirky way for a second, then crosses to the closet, opens the door and exits into it. MITCH Hello? Getting no response, Mitch rises, goes to the closet, opens it and looks in. MITCH Hello? There is no one there. MITCH What kind of place is this? Mitch crosses to his luggage. he opens a bag and, to his surprise, he finds it empty. he then looks in the other bag and find they've all been cleaned out. Puzzled, he shuts the bags. Suddenly, the door swings open and CHRIS KINSLEY , who we saw earlier at PEI, ENTERS. He's dragging a large piece of mechanical equipment. it is, in fact, a baseball pitching machine. CHRIS Hi. Mitch stares. CHRIS (CONT'D) Hey, you just gonna sit there admiring the room or are you going to help me with this? MITCH What is this thing? CHRIS It's a penis stretcher. You want to try it out? MITCH No! CHRIS Oh really? Well, congratulations, then, No, It's an Iron Mike. MITCH What? CHRIS A baseball pitching machine. Chris is setting it up. MITCH I was here for a second this morning... CHRIS (frightened) You didn't straighten the place up, did you? MITCH (looks around at the mess) No. CHRIS Good. 'Cause all my filth's in alphabetical order. Chris puts on a baseball cap and grabs a bat. MITCH Anyway, I dropped off my luggage and now all my bags are empty. A ball is pitched. Chris connects and the ball smashes through the window. CHRIS I put your stuff away for you. Another pitch. He smashes a ball into a wall. CHRIS (CONT'D) It's all in the bottom drawer. Shirts, pants, underwear, shoes. I had a little trouble with your sport jacket, so I threw it out. Nah, only kidding. This one's for you, little Johnny. He whacks another pitch. He does a crowd cheer and circles the bases. CHRIS What a game. I'm Chris Kinsley. MITCH Oh, no. INT. MOVING CAR- SAME TIME Dr. Atherton is riding in a rental car with DON CARMICHAEL, a government contract monitor. These two guys are part of an old boy network involved with research and development. CARMICHAEL We're falling way behind, Jer. ATHERTON Well, we're not making cheese sandwiches here, you know, Don. CARMICHAEL That's a good one. I'll have to remember to use that, Jer. ATHERTON The new boy is quick. CARMICHAEL He better be because the company needs a practical working model within four months. ATHERTON You can't dictate innovation. CARMICHAEL Let me put this another way, Jer. You know all that money we've been spending for development? ATHERTON Yes CARMICHAEL Well, when a project gets cut off, the finance boys always run an audit. ATHERTON I see. The car pulls up to Atherton's house, where there is a great deal of construction going on. Once the work is completed, this is going to be beautifully restored, rather large Victorian home. CARMICHAEL (looking out) Having a little work done on the old place, are you? Looks nice. INT. MITCH'S ROOM-THAT NIGHT Mitch is gathering up some books. He looks at a chart on the wall. MITCH Library... library...205. The door to the room opens while Mitch is looking the other way. We catch a glimpse of the same tall, bulkily-built man opening Mitch's closet door and disappearing inside. Mitch turns just in time to see the door close. he goes into it, opens it and looks inside. Nothing. he goes to the door of his room. Mitch opens the door, steps into the hall and slips, landing on his ass. His books go flying. INT. HALLWAY The hall floor is covered with ice wall-to-wall. Skating MUSIC is playing on a cassette somewhere. A few students, dressed for winter, are skating. Chris skates over and helps Mitch to his feet. CHRIS Welcome to Pacific Tech's "Smart People On Ice." He whirls away, leaping from wall to wall, sliding quickly down the ice. He stops in front of a short, roly-poly kid of Japanese descent, MARK ICKAGAMI, better know as ICK. Ick is a bio-chemist who spends a great deal of time in his lab experimenting with various fun compounds that do things ranging from making artificial ice to increasing memory. CHRIS (with a proletariat accent) Ice turned out real good, Ick. ICK Yeah, it worked., didn't it? CHRIS What did you use? ICK (teasing) Oh, sure, I tell you then you tell somebody else, and the next thing you know we're in the middle of another ice age. CHRIS (yelling down the hall) Come on, people. Nobody's skating. A STUDENT (O.C.) Just 'cause you're a slack, Kinsley. CHRIS Moles and trolls. MITCH What? CHRIS Moles and trolls. Work, work, work, work. I plan this for weeks. I go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is study. I'm hurt. I know that's it's not like me but I'm sorry. I'm starting to get discouraged, people. We had nobody at the mutant hamster races, one entry in the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was disqualified later. Why do I even bother? Chris skates off. MITCH (to Ick) How does he do it? ICK Well, I'm not an expert, but I think he puts one foot in front of the other and pushes. MITCH Not skating. The horsing around. The never studying. I know he's smart. but nobody's that smart. ICK I don't know how smart he is. Before he even came here he invented a solar battery, which laid the groundwork for the system that provides the energy for Amarillo, at half the cost. He'd be a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it. How he pulls the grades, I don't know. Just then, ROARING down the hall, face down on a sled, comes JORDANS COCHRAN. She is an advanced engineering student with great theoretical and mechanical skill who can never seem to pitched energy of a hyper-kinetic kindergarten class. She crashes at Mitch's feet. He reaches down to help her. MITCH You okay? JORDAN No, not emotionally, no I'm not. I'm disappointed... not terribly, but still, it should have gone much, further, much faster. It's okay, though, I know what the problem is, that's simple, it's obviously the drag coefficient, I'll just have to re-design the blades. I can do that, that's easy. I can do that here; but I have to cut then after they're designed, that takes tools, that takes time. How long is this stuff going to last, do you know? ICK Maybe another half an hour. JORDAN That's great, that's good. I can do that, no problem, lots of time. (to Mitch) What's your name? MITCH Mitch JORDAN Thanks for the help. See you. And in a flash she is gone. MITCH Your welcome. (to Ick) Who was that? ICK That? that was... Jordan rushes back. JORDAN (to Mitch) I'm Jordan, I realized I'd forgotten to tell you my name, it's Jordan. I heard there was going to be someone new this term, are you a freshman? MITCH Yes. JORDAN Do you have a bed? MITCH Yeah. JORDAN Oh, I was going to make you one if you needed it but you don't so that's okay. Well, I gotta go, I'll see you later, probably. See you Ick, see you Mitch. As she races off, KENT enters carrying several binders. KENT What's all this suppose to be? CHRIS This? This is new kind of shovel. Mitch finds this very funny and reacts accordingly by laughing. Kent can't stand to be laughed at. KENT (Dumping the binders into Mitch's hands) This should keep you busy for awhile. This, plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a month. MITCH Aw! Kent, we were going to name you King of the Winter Carnival. KENT Ha ha. (to Ick) I suppose you're in on this, too. Did you make this stuff? ICK I'm not saying. KENT Who's going to clean it up? ICK Don't have to. It's going to go from solid form directly to gas. KENT (impressed by this fairly uncommon phenomenon) Really? What is it? ICK I'm not saying. But I can tell you that it's fairly rare, and very unstable. KENT You're all a bunch of degenerates. CHRIS We are? What about that time I caught you naked with a bowl of Jello? KENT (flustered) I...you... I was hot and I was hungry. And anyway...Look, Kinsley, you're not number one anymore. CHRIS Number one what? KENT (pointing to Mitch) Mighty mouse, here, beat your placement scores by over twenty points. CHRIS Really? I guess you think you're pretty hot stuff? MITCH (uncomfortable, unsure if this is real) Well...no, I mean CHRIS Hey! Maybe you are smarter than me, but, can you do this? Chris pushes himself off backwards and slides along the ice in an attempt at a fancy figure skating move. Just as he's about to finish he crashes to the floor at the precise moment that the floor turns into a cloud of rising gas. Chris disappears in the cloud. ICK (excited) It worked! MITCH That's neat. ICK (teasing) Now if we can just keep it from exploding. Kent runs away. CHRIS (from inside the growing cloud) Hey, Ick. Is it okay to breathe this stuff? (beat) Ick? (beat) Ick? The cloud fills the screen. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-THE NEXT MORNING Perfect morning light streams through the window, making even this dump look beautiful. Chris is asleep in a strange position on his bed, proving that even asleep he is eccentric. We Pan across the room to Mitch. He has obviously fallen asleep while reading the binders that Kent had given him the night before. We HEAR the sound of the door opening, followed by some heavy footsteps. This causes Mitch to wake up. it takes him a second to realize where he is. He sits up. MITCH'S POV Again we catch just a glimpse of that same mysterious figure opening the closet door. He is holding a "McDonald's" bag. He closes the door behind him. ANGLE ON MITCH To say the least, he's thrown by this strange intrusion. MITCH Hello? He waits a beat, listening. Nothing happens so he gets up and crosses to the closet, looks inside. OVER MITCH'S SHOULDER INTO CLOSET There's nothing in there but clothes. Mitch pushes the garments aside and finds just a wall. ANGLE ON MITCH He shakes his head. This is getting frustrating. He exits the room. INT. BATHROOM Mitch crosses to the urinal. Just as he is about to relieve himself, the door opens. Jordan enters. This is an experience Mitch has never before and as a result he is one uncomfortable fifteen-year-old. JORDAN Hi, good morning, I thought I saw you come in here, you must be an earlier riser, we met last night, I'm Jordan, remember? I had a sled with me, I made you a sweater. She holds out a sweater. He leans into the urinal, trying to hide himself the best he can. MITCH Last night? JORDAN yeah, it's just something I do with my hands while I'm reading. I hope I got the size right, I'm pretty sure I did, I have a brother so I use him as a sizing comparison, and I have a pretty good eye for that sort of thing, so I just went ahead and made you one because I was, you know, up. Peeing? MITCH Yeah. JORDAN I never sleep. I don't know why. It drove my roommate nuts. I mean really nuts, they had to take her away in an ambulance and everything, she's okay now thought but she had to be transfer to an easier school but I don't know if that part has anything to do with being my fault, but still, anyway, if you ever want any help studying at night or just let me know, okay, 'cause I'm just a couple of doors down from you guys and I'm usually up and I wouldn't mind, okay? MITCH Thanks, I will. JORDAN Are you finished yet? MITCH I can't start. JORDAN Because I'm here? MITCH I think so. JORDAN Isn't that weird? Well, I have to go. MITCH Me, too. JORDAN Right, well, don't forget what I said, I'll put the sweater in your room, see you later, tell Chris that if he wants one I'll be happy to make him one but nit today because after classes I'm going to rebuild the back part of my room, you should come down and see it later, I have to go, bye. She exits. MITCH (stunned) bye. INT. THE LOBBY AREA OF THE DORM- A LITTLE LATER Mitch is coming down a hallway into the area. He is dressed in his tie and jacket and has books under his arm. As he crosses past the self-serve vending machine he spots Chris entering the kitchen. Mitch follows him inside. MITCH Something strange happened to me this morning. CHRIS Was it a dream where you see yourself dressed up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses nude women throwing little pickles at you? MITCH No CHRIS Why am I the only person who has that dream? Before Mitch can ask another question, Chris open the freezer compartment and takes out a large thermos-like container. He takes it over to the cutting board, then takes from his pocket a pair of calipers, a pair of tweezers, and a little box that looks like a dental floss kit. He opens the container which immediately starts pouring thick steam. MITCH Liquid nitrogen? Chris uses calipers to extract a length of tubing from inside the container. he puts it down on the board and, using the tweezers, pushing out a cylindrical mound of ice from inside the tube. Then, from the dental floss kit, he pulls out a length of very fine wire, which he uses to cut the ice into a number of thin "coins" and slides then into the lid of the container, which he picks up and takes out the door with him. Mitch follows. INT. VENDING MACHINE AREA CHRIS Coffee? Using the tweezers, Chris picks up an ice coin and puts it into one of the machines. There is a high-pitched squeak. To Mitch's astonishment, the machine accepts the bogus money and a cup drops down and fills with coffee. CHRIS So, what's happened? MITCH Oh. There's a guy living in our closet. CHRIS You've seen him too? Chris puts his coins in several of the machines and retrieves from them junk food junky's treasure trove of goodies. MITCH Who is it? CHRIS Hopsfield. MITCH Is he... safe? CHRIS So far. Chris exits. Mitch stares after him. SCHOOL MONTAGE: A quick series of shots moves us through the next two months of time, accompanied by an original song. INT. LECTURE HALL-DAY An older professor is lecturing, pointing to a complicated algebraic problem on a blackboard, Mitch is in the last row of this student-filled, multi-tiered classroom. Everyone else listens intently and makes notes while Mitch thumbs quickly through a textbook, then closes it and makes a note in a loose-leaf binder. INT. ATOM SMASHER ROOM-DAY Mitch stands with a group of other students watching an instructor explain the intricacies of nuclear fission. Mitch opens a notebook and starts writing furiously. INT. ATHERTON'S PROJECT LAB-DAY Mitch is using his notes and some pieces of equipment to explain something to the rest of the team. Chris is impressed. Kent shakes his head in disagreement until Atherton nods his approval, at which point Kent also agrees. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-NIGHT it is late but Mitch is still hard at the books. Hopsfield goes by and disappears in the closet. Mitch doesn't even notice anymore. There is a knock at the door and Jordan enters. She has brought Mitch a device that she just built which holds textbooks and turns the pages automatically. INT. LECTURE HALL-DAY Mitch, dressed more informally, is in the same room with the same professor as in scene 54. This time, however, there are several empty seats. The people have been replaced by cassette tape recorders. Mitch takes notes. INT. CHEMICAL ENGINEERING LAB-DAY Mitch enters with another student to find a teddy bear waiting for him at his place. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-NIGHT Mitch and Chris work alone. it is obviously very late. Using a variety of exotic-looking devices, they put the laser through its paces and make notes. INT. LECTRURE HALL-DAY This time, Mitch is the only student. Tape recorders sit in front of every seat. The professor drones on, apparently oblivious to what he sees in front of him. INT. WAVE TANK ROOM-DAY A very attractive instructress is demonstrating a dye trace experiment in a huge wave tank. Mitch takes notes. INT. DINING HALL Mitch and Ick are carrying trays of food, looking for a place to sit. They pass a seated Kent, who points out a place for Mitch, who looks to see a highchair at the end of the table. EXT. LIBRARY-MORNING Mitch comes down the stairs with several books under his arms. He stumbles and drops one of the books. As he struggles to recover it, it is handed to him by none other than Hopsfield. By the time Mitch realizes who it is, the mysterious figure is once again gone. EXT. STREET-DAY Mitch is crossing the street carrying a huge load of books. Suddenly a yellow Citroen pulls up behind him and honks its horn causing Mitch to drop everything. He looks at the driver and sees that it is a laughing Kent. INT. ATHERTON'S CLASSROOM Chris, Kent, Bodie and Carter are present as Atherton wraps up a day's class. People take serious notes. Chris reads a magazine. People file out and Mitch enters approaches Chris to get him to work on the laser. Chris shakes his head. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-LATE NIGHT Mitch is working alone. He adjusts the laser and turns it on. It burns through a very thick block of wood, but Mitch is still not pleased. INT. HALLWAY-NEXT MORNING A very tired Mitch heads for the lecture hall. He comes to the door, opens it and enters to see a tape recorder lecturing to a roomful of tape recorders. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-ANOTHER NIGHT In need of a break from studying, Mitch goes to the closet in hopes of figuring out how to open the wall. He examines the walls and the floor and looks, for hidden switches or secret mechanisms, all to no avail. As he's about to give up, the closet door swings closed. When it closes, the wall opens to reveal a small elevator-like cage. Mitch steps in and the cage descends. It hits a lever and stops. But before Mitch steps in and the can get off, it begins to move sideways, triggering another pulley, and goes down again into the steam tunnels, then drags along the floor and stops. Mitch gets out. It's spooky. In the distance there is a glow of light. Mitch goes forward until he can see the home of Hopsfield. It's a very utilitarian example of life on the edge, with all the comforts. At the console of an amazing, hand-built computer sits amazing Hopsfield. Mitch watches in awe from the darkness. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-DAY There is an experiment in progress. A large laser is building up an energy load. Atherton, Kent, Bodie, Carter, and Mitch monitor various pieces of equipment. Things hum and click and there is a sense that something big is going to happen. Atherton seems pleased, while Mitch seems troubled. Suddenly, a valve blows and a stream of liquid nitrogen hisses from a hose, spewing frost over everything. Everyone jumps for switches and they shut the experiment down. CARTER (checking the valve) It's nothing. It's just mechanical. ATHERTON GOOD. Don't bother changing it. I want you and Bodie to rebuild the whole unit; same output in half the size. Should hold up, right Mitch? MITCH Sure, as long as we go with H.F. ATHERTON Well, gentlemen, now what? Things are going okay so far, aren't they? KENT They certainly are in my area, Jerry. ATHERTON (warning) KENT KENT (unaware) Yes? MITCH Boy, when I think of all the applications for this...! ATHERTON (covering) We've got enough theory to deal with without talking applications. You just worry about giving me that power breakthrough. how close are you? KENT (gloating) Not very, from what I hear. ATHERTON (to Mitch) Aren't you and Chris working together? MITCH Yes...but... ATHERTON Where is Mr. Kinsley? KENT (anxious to get Chris in trouble) He's outside. Kent goes to the window and shouts down. KENT (CONT'D) (shouting) Kinsley! Dr. Atherton wants you. EXT. LAB BUILDING-MEDIUM CLOSE ON CHRIS-WAIST UP He's sitting on a chaise lounge with a stack of encyclopedias, sipping a beer. CHRIS Coming. PULL OUT TO REVEAL that the chaise lounge has balloons tied to each corner. Chris dumps a volume from his lap and the chaise rises straight up in the air. ANGEL ON ATHERTON AND CHRIS-FRAMED BY THE WINDOW Chris hovers in mid-air. ATHERTON What are you doing out there? CHRIS Floating, sir. And thinking. ATHERTON (fuming) I want to see you at my house at six o'clock. Sharp. CHRIS Sounds fun. Should I bring anything? ATHERTON How about a proper attitude for a change? CHRIS I'll try and borrow one. Now, if you'll excuse me, there are millions of boys and girls everywhere waiting for me to bring them presents. Ho ho ho. He hands Atherton a volume and floats from view. INT. LAB Atherton, Mitch and Kent stand at the window, watching Chris ascend. KENT He's really pushing it, isn't he, Jerry? ANGLE ON MITCH He smiles as he watches his roommate and friend float off. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE-EARLY EVENING The restoration work is reaching completion and the house is looking pretty beautiful. A small crew of workmen paint and do other finishing work. Chris is sitting on the porch, watching. He is eating a very large puffs of popcorn from a bag. We SEE Atherton returning from his daily jog. He is decked out in an expensive designer jogging suit and has all the appropriate accessories. he also has all the silly habits of the trendy runner for cooling down and stretching. CHRIS You wanted to see me, your joggingness? ATHERTON Mr. Kinsley. Right on time. What a surprise. Do you run? CHRIS Only when chased. ATHERTON What are you eating? CHRIS It's one of mark's Ickagami's experiments. He's been irradiating corn with strontium. it's his hobby; big food. ATHERTON That's popcorn? CHRIS It's big popcorn. ATHERTON (over reacting) Get it away from me. I can't stand it. I hate popcorn. Leave it there. Chris puts the bag down on the porch. CHRIS Okay. Have you ever considered switching to de-caffeinated coffee? Atherton leads Chris to the front door, where he removes his shoes and then stands and waits until Chris does the same. They proceed into the house. INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE- CONTINUOUS The interior is immaculate. A classic example of elegant good taste. Atherton is fastidiously protective of his things. ATHERTON I want to start seeing a lot more of you in the lab. CHRIS You want me to work nude? ATHERTON Very funny, you're a major disappointment to me, Chris. CHRIS And you to me, Jerry. ATHERTON (angry) We had a deal! CHRIS And I advanced your project more than any three guys on campus. ATHERTON That was yesterday. What have you done for me today? CHRIS Hey, aren't you getting a little obsessive about this? I took in the new kid. He's working his guts out for you. ATHERTON Your arrogant, disrespectful behavior is distracting him. If you keep it up, you're going to pay for it. CHRIS Hey, I'm out of here. Delenda Est Cartheo. P.E.I. July one. ATHERTON You still have to pass, dear boy, and considering the fact that my class is a requisite, it would seem that I would have some control over your destiny. From now on, you and Mr. Simon are going to spend every waking moment working on my power problem and you will solve it by my deadline. CHRIS Okay, Jerry, but I really think you should see an analyst. Chris exits. Atherton watches him go. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-NIGHT Mitch is alone and trying to work on the new, smaller laser. He looks tired and upset. He tinkers around for a while, then goes back to his table and looks at his notes. Nothing seems to make sense anymore. Chris enters with a beaker in his hand. CHRIS Hi. Do me a favor, taste this. Mitch is confused. CHRIS (CONT'D) Come on, you won't hurt my feelings. MITCH I... Chris rams the spoon in his mouth. CHRIS Well, too sweet? Mitch makes a face. MITCH What is it? CHRIS Beats me. I just found it in one of the labs. MITCH Aggghh!! CHRIS Come on. I'm just pulling your leg. How are you doing? MITCH I'm stuck. Dr. Atherton says we've got to miniaturize the power supply and you're not helping. CHRIS Lighten up. It's only a laser. Chris goes to the laser. Mitch is annoyed. CHRIS (CONT'D) Instead of trying to take that roomful of capacitors over there and putting new perspective. Charge this baby up. Everything you've got. MITCH What for? CHRIS You'll see. Go Mitch goes next door. Chris, meanwhile, measures a certain distant from the floor and mounts a mirror on the wall above his head. He then moves to the laser and repositions it to shoot at the mirror. Mitch returns and makes some adjustments to a control panel. MITCH All set, I think. CHRIS Do it. Mitch throws a switch. Immediately, a loud electrical hum fills the air. Chris goes over and opens the door to the hall and glances left. CHRIS'S POV A roomful of capacitors loading. EXT. THE CAMPUS-NIGHT The lights twinkle from various buildings. WE HEAR the hum EXT. THE CAMPUS-NIGHT The lights twinkle from various buildings. We hear the hum growing. MITCH (V.O.) What are you doing now? CHRIS (V.O.) Making hamburgers. Suddenly, there are several loud snaps and all the lights on campus go off at once as the power overload blows the sub station fuses. MITCH (V.O.) Oh, no! INT. THE LAB IN DARKNESS CHRIS Relax, it's just the fuses at the sub station. They'll have it back on in a second. More importantly, did we get a charge? Suddenly there is a loud "crack" and the laser sends out a beam across the room, bouncing off the mirror on the wall., out the door, where it hits another mirror and disappears from sight. MITCH Wow! EXT. THE CAMPUS-CONTINUOUS The beam has formed a web of light across the darkened campus. The effect is quite spectacular. People look in awe. Chris and Mitch exit the physics building. CHRIS Follow the yellow brick road. MITCH Have you ever considered the fact that you are completely wasting your life? CHRIS Constantly. The lights on campus come back on as Chris and Mitch continue to follow the beam. INT. WAVE TANK BUILDING An open window above the door lets the beam of light enter. Chris and Mitch enter. INT. HALLWAY-CONTINUOUS Chris and Mitch walk down a stairway through an open door, following the beam. INT. WAVE TANK ROOM-CONTINUOUS The place has been turned into an indoor Waikiki. The beam has been directed into a hood-shaped device that has split it into enough rays to cook a bunch of hot dogs and hamburgers on an improvised barbeque, managed by ICK, who is dressed for the beach and wearing a welding mask. Past him we can see that there about twenty girls and some guys present. Several of them are water-skiing on the mechanically produced waves inside the tank, towed by an elaborated pulleys system. Others are frolicking on the "beach" and cut out palms stand around, achieving the desired effect. Blankets have been laid out and girls sit on them eating hot dogs and talking. There are sun lamps set up in one area and some kids are smoothing sun tan oil and shagging a few rays. Rock music fills the room. ICK (lifts his mask) Aloha. ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY A lot of the guys we've seen around the dorm have started to arrive. They enter hesitantly at Chris's urging. CHRIS Come on in, boys. Surf's up. Awestruck, shy but excited, they approach. CORNELL (a nerdy student) I have a geochemistry test tomorrow and I do not feel adequately prepared. CHRIS But the main thing is you look good. CORNELL Thanks. MILTON What if we end up having too much fun and end up failing? CHRIS And would that be the end of the world. Milton? MILTON Yes, it would. CHRIS Yeah, you're right. Maybe you should go back to the library. MILTON Well, maybe I could just look for a minute. CORNELL (noticing) Are those girls? CHRIS I haven't had them all tested yet, Cornell, but so far so good. MITCH Who are they? MILTON They're not from here. I'd know. CHRIS No, no they're not, they're from a nearby college though. MITCH Which one? CHRIS The Wanda Trossler School of beauty. MITCH They're beauticians? CHRIS Not yet. CORNELL Gee, I don't know... CHRIS They'll teach you. Let's get serious here, lads. There are 670 guys at pacific tech and 136 girls. MILTON A ratio of 4.93 to 1 CHRIS Good, Milton. Of the 136 girls, most of them can find guys a lot better than you. CORNELL Oh, easily. CHRIS These girls are not used to geniuses. You might impress them. CORNELL I don't see how. CHRIS Let me put this another way. Given the type of people you are and the environment you're in, you guys have to admit the strong probability that this may be the only chance you'll ever get in your entire lives to have sex. There is a pause while everyone considers the hypothesis. CHRIS (CONT'D) Think about it. He turns and heads into the party. After a beat, everyone except Mitch follows Chris's lead. ANGLES ON VARIOUS ACTIVITIES- A LITTLE LATER Water-skiing, dancing, a volleyball game. Most of the guys are making an effort to socialize. Mitch watches quietly. ANGLE ON MILTON TALKING TO A GIRL OVER BY THE SUN LAMPS. VIVIAN So, what do you guys do? Just be smart all the time? MILTON Well... VIVIAN What's your major? MILTON Astrophysics. VIVIAN Is that like sports medicine? MILTON Space. VIVIAN (impressed) Oh! Let me ask you something about that. If I was on the moon, Could I like tease hair much higher? MILTON Theoretically. VIVIAN This is fascinating. ANGLE ON another guy named Fenton and a girl. They're necking. CONNIE My friend Evelyn, tells me that brilliant men are the best lovers. FENTON I'd say that's true. CONNIE Up to now, what's been your ultimate sexual experience? FENTON I once fell off a ladder and landed on my sister, Bernice. ANGLE ON CONNELL, and a girl in the tank. they both bob up out of the water. Cornell still has his glasses on. He takes them off and can't see. LOUISA Why do you wear those glasses? CORNELL So I can see. LOUISA But you look very sexy without them. Reflexively he breaks his glasses in his hands. ANGLE ON MILTON AND VIVIAN. He rubbing suntan oil on her back MILTON I really should be studying. VIVIAN Me too. I have a bleaching final tomorrow. MILTON (sneezing) Achew. VIVIAN Bless you. MILTON I'm allergic to suntan oil. VIVIAN Maybe you should stop. MILTON (aroused) I don't think I can ANGLE ON CORNELL AND LOUISA. They are sitting on the "beach" toweling off. LOUISA (very sexy) You know, I read in the Enquirer that woman paid twenty thousand dollars for the sperm of a genius. CORNELL Really? LOUISA (putting her arms around him) I've GOT TWENTY BUCKS? CORNELL Do you have a cup? ANGLE ON MITCH The party is in full swing and most of the guys have become very comfortable. Some are making out. Mitch now seems like the only one left out. he sees a pretty GIRL just coming out of the water. She adjusts her top. Mitch wanders over to her. MITCH (with great effort) Hi. TAMMY Hi. MITCH I was watching you...swim. TAMMY Yes? MITCH I was thinking of maybe going for a swim myself. TAMMY Yeah? Is this the kiddy pool? She exits, leaving Mitch devastated. He goes and sits in a corner. Meanwhile, Chris is looking around proudly. It's obvious he didn't see what just happen to Mitch. He smiles at the fun everyone is having. A girl passes him eating a hamburger. CHRIS Don't eat that! KIMBERLY Huh? CHRIS Don't you know eating that stuff can give you very large breasts? (mock despair) Oh. My god! I see I'm too late. She laughs. He puts his arms around her and they walk off. As Chris and Kimberly EXIT, we catch a glimpse of a face in a window. We push in to see Kent, spying. INT. CLASSROOM-SAME TIME (BUT APPEARS TO BE DAY) OPEN TIGHT on Atherton's face. He looks odd, as there are Kleenex tissues sticking out from his shirt collar. A hand comes into frame, holding a pancake makeup puff, and starts applying it to his face. ATHERTON Christ, Don. I'm doing the best I can. You act like I don't want my own invention to work. There are only so many hours in a day. CAMERA PULLS BACK CARMICHAEL I agree. And what's more important, massaging your ego on television explaining the digestive system of a rabbit to the great unwashed or "project crossbow" MAKEUPMAN Off-hand, I'd say television. ATHERTON (angrily to make up man) Just get rid of the crows' feet! (to Carmichael carefully) There's nothing more important than " crossbow," but when went from blue sky to black you turned into Bigfoot. The STAGE MANAGER approaches. STAGE MANAGER Ready to go, Dr. Atherton. He exits. ATHERTON Pushing me doesn't help. You tell them that. He walks away. There is definitely no love between them. ATHERTON (CONT'D) (under his breath) Son of a bitch. CARMICHAEL (under his breath) Asshole. ANGLE ON ATHERTON as he walks over to the cue card man and checks through the cards. KENT enters in a rush. KENT I have something to... ATHERTON (cutting him off) Did you pick up my dry cleaning? KENT Yes I did... there's something you should know. ATHERTON The gravy stain? KENT No, that came out. (very pleased) Chris and Mitch aren't working. They're at a party. Atherton begins to seethe. ATHERTON I want to show me where, right after I'm finished here. KENT (all smiles) My pleasure. STAGE MANAGER In five...four... Kent forgets to move. Atherton shoves him off. We HEAR an off-stage CRASH. STAGE MANAGER (CONT'D) ...three...two...and... We PUSH in on nearby monitor. the show's logo comes on, along with its theme MUSIC. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) WELCOME TO "SCIENCE," WITH YOUR HOST, Dr. JEROME ATHERTON. FUNDED BY... A NEW CARD SHOWS ON THE MONITOR. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... A grant from Pacific Electric Instruments. PEI. And now, Dr. Atherton. Atherton appears on the monitor. ANGLE ON ATHERTON IN THE STUDIO He smiles broadly and reads from the cue cards. ATHERTON Good evening. Tonight we're going to look at something most of us take for granted... the colon. What's it look like? KENT WANDERS BY IN THE BACKGROUND. INT. WAVE TANK ROOM-LATER THAT NIGHT THE PARTY IS STILL GOING STRONG. ANGLE ON JORDAN She tosses a volleyball up into the air in a one-woman game of catch. Mitch approaches forlornly. JORDAN Wanna play? MITCH I'm not very... HE GETS SMACKED IN THE HEAD BY THE BALL. MITCH (CONT'D) Sure, all right. Through the following, Mitch and Jordan volley the ball between them. JORDAN Some party, huh? MITCH I guess. (hesitant) How come you're not... JORDAN Necking? MITCH well... JORDAN I'm not gay. MITCH (embarrassed) I didn't... I wouldn't even... JORDAN Look, I'm seventeen. I'm brilliant, and I'm hyper kinetic. Guy are a little afraid of me, you know. It'll pass...I hope. ANGLE ON MITCH MITCH (softly) I think you're very nice. Mitch gets smashed on the head with the ball, sending his glasses flying. Suddenly, Atherton burst into the room, followed closely by Kent. ATHERTON (seeing Mitch) Simon! He passes the tape deck and snaps it OFF. Everything comes to a stop as Atherton heads for Mitch, all eyes trained on the pending drama. ATHERTON You were supposed to be in the lab tonight. KENT (chiming in) Weren't you! MITCH I was and... ATHERTON You are at Pacific Tech to work, not to behave like a philistine. KENT That's right! MITCH I was working, I... ATHERTON Where's Kinsley. I imagine this was his idea. KENT No doubt! ATHERTON (annoyed) Kent! KENT (stiffening) yes? ATHERTON (to Mitch, very angry) I took a big chance recommending a fifteen-year-old. I guess I made a mistake. I hope you're proud of yourself. Kent is in seventh heaven as Atherton turns and heads for the door. As they exiting, they pass Cornell and his date. CORNELL Dr. Atherton? ATHERTON What! CORNELL Are you wearing makeup? Atherton can only stare in his rage. LOUISA Is it too try and hide those crows' feet? He growls and exits. ANGLE ON MITCH He is truly at a loss in the face of this cruelty. Everyone is staring at him. He runs out the door. ANGLE ON JORDAN She watches Mitch go, feeling very badly for him INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-THE NEXT NIGHT Mitch, tired, looking like a kid who's been working for hours, is staring at a formula on the blackboard. Frustrated, he throws his screwdriver against it in anger and runs into the adjacent room and begins disconnecting the capacitor bank. INT. LAB HALLWAY-EARLY MORNING Kent, Bodie and Carter cross toward the lab. Just then, Mitch comes out. He looks exhausted and very upset. As he passes Kent, he turns away from his stare. KENT (mock concern) Gee, he looks depressed. The other guys yuk it up. They turn and watch Mitch go into Atherton's office down the hall. They follow in time to HEAR: MITCH (O.S.) I'd like to make a collect call to Mrs. Bill Simon. Kent's eyes light up with an idea. INT. ATHERTON'S OFFICE Mitch is on the phone. He's very upset. MITCH I know, but I don't like it here anymore. I want to live at home with you... (reluctant) Yeah, and dad. I want to go back to high school. I-dad did what? Rented out my room? ...Well, why can't Mr. Echevarria and I share it?... Please, ma, I want to come home. INT. KENT'S LAB-TIGHT ON A MINI TAPE RECORDER Its reels are spinning. It's being held up to a telephone receiver. MITCH (V.O./FILTER) (crying) Please let me come home. I don't want to stay here. WIDEN to reveal Kent holding the recorder as cater and Bodie watch. The workbench area in Kent's lab is covered with a drop cloth. Kent chuckles as MITCH pleads with his mother. INT. DORM HALL-DINING ROOM-NEXT MORNING The dorm population is eating their breakfast. Kent and his unholy two are smugly downing their "shredded wheat" Mitch is alone off in the corner. It's obvious he hasn't slept. Chris enters and crosses to Kent. A WAITRESS, middle-aged, is serving coffee. CHRIS Kent...let's never fight like that again. KENT What? CHRIS We've been lovers too long to have a silly argument come between us. The waitress stares disgustedly at Kent. KENT Chris... CHRIS Please. Don't speak. You were right. Tonight I'll wear the cowboy suit. CHRIS EXITS KENT (sputtering) You... WAITRESS Do your parents know about this? KENT Of course not! She nods and exits. Kent calls after her. KENT (CONT'D) Nobody knows. I mean, there's nothing to know. ANOTHER ANGLE Chris walks over to Mitch. CHRIS Where were you all last night? MITCH The lab. Where you were supposed to be. CHRIS Jordan told me about Atherton coming down on you...what exactly did... Mitch abruptly turns his back to Chris and continues eating. Chris sees the conversation is over. CHRIS (CONT'D) (referring to the sentence he never finished) ...Let me hold that thought and get back to ya. ANOTHER ANGLE Ken, Bodie and Carter. The gentle strains of classical music fill the room. KENT Something soothing to eat by. The tape is abruptly interrupted by the RECORDING Kent made of Mitch on the phone to his mother. ANGLE ON MITCH He can't believe his ears. His expression runs from surprise to embarrassment. ANOTHER ANGLE Everyone stops eating and listens to Mitch begging his mother to come home. They share his embarrassment and lower their heads. Even Kent's friends are uncomfortable. Kent, on the other hand, is laughing it up, having a great time. ANGLE ON MITCH He's in a state of shock. ANGLE ON KENT KENT (he can't wait ) Here comes the crying! He loves it. ANGLE ON MITCH He runs out of the dinning room. Kent loves Mitch reaction. It makes him laugh harder. ANGLE ON CHRIS CHRIS (to himself) Too low. INT. MITCH'S ROOM-A FEW MINUTES LATER Mitch is trying to pack, but it's difficult because the place is in such disarray. Chris enters. He watches and tries to think of what to say. CHRIS Okay, if you want to leave, go ahead. But you'll miss the fun. MITCH (sour) What fun? CHRIS Ick invented a new virus and we're gonna release it in Kent's room. Mitch turns on Chris with surprising hostility. MITCH That's sick! That's a sick thing to do! CHRIS Hey, I was just kidding, I... MITCH You're always just kidding. There's something wrong with you. CHRIS Just a second... MITCH The other night I needed your help and all you wanted to do was party. CHRIS I tried to help you. I tried to help you relax. MITCH Being snubbed by beauticians isn't my idea of relaxing. CHRIS Student beauticians. MITCH (Blows up) I thought this place was going to be different, but it's just the same. I'm either used or made fun of. In high school they pushed me in a mailbox, did I tell you that? CHRIS They called me Chris the whiss'... MITCH Really? What's a whiss? CHRIS I think they meant wuss, but it didn't rhyme...when I was three years old, I balanced my father's checkbook so they sent me to school and fired their accountant. My father was so intimidated, he stopped speaking to me. My teacher disliked me because I was smarter than they were, and my classmates hated me because I bell the bell curve. Sound familiar? And tell me why my...why did my mother dress me in white shirts, hush puppies and a briefcase, guaranteeing that a girl would never talk to me? Mitch looks down at his own white shirt and hush puppies. MITCH YOU? CHRIS (Dramatic) And then one night, in this room, I was sitting right where you are sitting now. I had a vision. I saw him. MITCH god CHRIS Hopsfield. MITCH Hopsfield? Oh! The guy in the closet. CHRIS Yeah. Laslo Hopsfield. I followed him. Through the closet; down into the steam tunnels. And down there I saw the most disgusting thing Ive ever seen. MITCH (Frighten) What? CHRIS Hopsfield in his pajamas. MITCH LAUGHS. CHRIS (Lighter, but sincere) And I talk to the guy . Turned out that in the Seventies he was the number one stud around here. Smarter than you and me put together. So brilliant, so sharp, so advanced, so long. MITCH What do you mean? CHRIS He graduated. Went to work for some chemical company. One day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing people. I think it was his mother. He freaked. You see, he was totally unprepared for the real world. He had no philosophy. He thought science was the answer for everything. Mitch Am I gonna wind up in a steam tunnel? CHRIS Yes, you are, Metaphorically speaking. Unless you see that the same thing that has made your life miserable can make it great; your brain. When you're smart, people need you, and you can learn how to work that for fun and profit. MITCH You had a arrangement going with Atherton, don't you? That's why you don't have to study. CHRIS Hey, I don't carry a briefcase. (pause) You're a nice kid. If you leave I'll miss you. MITCH (thinking about it) If I stay, what should I do, I mean... CHRIS Well, the first thing you have to do is get even with Kent. It's a moral imperative. MITCH (smiles) Yeah. EXT. CAMPUS-NIGHT Kent's Citroen pulls up. Kent and Carter get out and walk by Jordan, who is sitting nearby. KENT And at Northern Electronics you get the stock options, but not the free housing, It's what makes PEI so sweet. You get everything. CARTER Yeah, and Kinsley's got that locked. KENT (knowingly) Maybe he does, and maybe he doesn't. They walk away. After a beat, CHRIS, MITCH and ICK jump out from behind another car. Mitch carries a TOOL BOX. JORDAN Over here! The others rush over to her. Chris trains a light on the license plate. It reads, "KENT." CHRIS He puts his name on his car. He does the same thing with his underwear. Mitch flops down the tool box. 5R5DISSOLVE TO: MONTAGE Chris, Mitch, Jordan and Ick working on Kent's car. They are undoing bolts, talking out wires, removing fenders, etc. The last DISSOLVE and we see the car is gone. And no sign of our foursome. EXT. DORM HALL-NIGHT Chris quietly goes up the stairs inside the dorm carrying a steering wheel. Ick and Mitch have an engine on a flatbed cart. Jordan enters carrying heavy chains and a drill. EXT. KENT'S ROOM-EARLY MORNING Filthy with crankcase oil, Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan exit and scamper down the hall. All are very pleased with themselves. EXT. KENT'S ROOM-LATER THAT MORNING Kent is coming down the hall. he opens his door and walks inside. INT. KENT"S ROOM CLOSEUP ON KENT. His jaw drops open. ANOTHER ANGLE Chris and Mitch enter. CHRIS Hey, Kent. That's your car. MITCH You're not supposed to park on campus. KENT This isn't funny. You went too far this time, Kinsley. CHRIS I had help. KENT (surprised, to Mitch) You? (a beat) I'm going to get you guys. Dr. Atherton's gonna hear about this. He storms out of his room. CHRIS (calls to Kent) Hey, Kent, you owe us ten dollars for the gas. (to Mitch) He'll never pay us. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE-DUSK The restoration has been completed and the house looks beautiful. Chris comes up the walk, goes to the door and rings the bell. A very pretty girl named SUSAN answers the door. INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE-CONTINUOUS Chris enters. CHRIS Wow! Hello. SUSAN Hi. CHRIS Jerry asked me to drop by. What did he ask you to do? SUSAN What? CHRIS Which word didn't you understand? SUSAN Are you here for the meeting? CHRIS What meeting? SUSAN I don't know. CHRIS Okay. SUSAN I'm just waiting. CHRIS Right. The study doors open and Atherton, Carmichael and Decker step out. DECKER (finishing their conversation) And finally, it comes down to, if you can't do it, we'll get somebody else. I have a timetable, doctor. CARMICHAEL We're very close, Dave, don't worry, everything's going to be fine. DECKER (cold as ice) Don, try and remember you work for me. (to Atherton) I think I've made my point, haven't I? ATHERTON (equally as cold) Crystal clear, Mr. Decker. DECKER Good. CHRIS Anything I should know about? ATHERTON Shut up Kinsley. I'll be with you in a moment. DECKER Goodbye, Jerry, and good luck. Susan? They begin to exit. Chris takes Susan's hand. CHRIS I guess this is goodbye. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to know you. At all. (to the boys in admiration) Have you ever seen breasts like theses before? DECKER She happens to be my daughter. CHRIS Oh, then I guess you have. CARMICHAEL (to Atherton) I'll be reporting to him every day. DECKER Coming, Don? CARMICHAEL Yes, Sir. They exit. ATHERTON What do you think you're doing? CHRIS You said come over. ATHERTON Take off those shoes. Chris removes his shoes to reveal even dirtier socks. ATHERTON (CONT'D) Stay off the rugs. INT. STUDY-CONTINOUS CHRIS What's up, Doc. ATHERTON I'm withdrawing your recommendation to PEI. CHRIS What? ATHERTON I'm giving Kent the job. CHRIS Did you suddenly find humor? ATHERTON You haven't solved my power problem. CHRIS I'm trying. ATHERTON No, you're not. So, I'm going to fail you, so you won't graduate, so you can't take the job. Q.E.D. CHRIS I'll pass your exam. Atherton just smiles a "so what" smile. CHRIS (CONT'D) We had a deal! ATHERTON Did we? That doesn't sound very ethical. CHRIS You can't do this. I'll go to Dr. Meredith. ATHERTON (enjoying this) Go ahead. What are you going to tell him. Don't forget, like most scientists, he is an honorable, moral man who thinks everyone else is too. I'll just deny anything you say. CHRIS You dick! ATHERTON Count on it. EXT. DORM ROOF-NIGHT Chris sits, lost in thought, outside the window of his room, Mitch appears at the window, sees Chris and climbs out to join him. MITCH What are you doing? CHRIS Self-realization. I was thinking of jumping, but it's only twelve feet. MITCH Something wrong? CHRIS No. Atherton is going to flunk me out of school. MITCH But you had a deal. CHRIS Yeah, and he says I didn't deliver. You sleep with pits, you wake up smelly. I think Aristotle said that. It was him or Eva Gabor. At least Hopsfield still has his integrity. MITCH Excuse me? CHRIS I thought I was so smart. I didn't want to be like the other dumb geniuses like Hopsfield. I though I could use Them., instead of Them using me. But, Guess what? MITCH I have to agree. It does appear that you've been the victim of your own erroneous logic. CHRIS Thank you. MITCH However, this doesn't mean that you can't get yourself out. CHRIS How? MITCH Hard work? CHRIS But that's the old way. GRINDING MONTAGE A series of shots showing Chris hard at work, underscored by an original song. INT. LASER LAB Mitch and Chris dismantle part of the laser. INT. DINING HALL Mitch, Jordan and Ick are listening as Chris shows them diagrams and formulas for a laser supercharger while they try to eat. INT. BIOCHEMISTRY LAB Chris and Ick search for a new gas combination for the laser supercharger. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB Mitch and Chris work hard on a second laser. Kent is both upset and suspicious of Chris' new interest in work. INT. ATHERTON'S CLASSROOM Chris enters carrying books and a note pad. Kent sees this and is shocked. Atherton gives Chris a "you haven't got a chance" grin. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-NIGHT They both study for exams; on the wall is a chart of exam week showing Mitch's exam schedule, a big red square around Chris' exam with Atherton and, in every free hour is written " Laser". INT. DORM LIBRARY Many students, including our gang, study for exams. Suddenly, Milton can't take the pressure any longer and momentarily goes out of his mind and runs from the room. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB A tired looking Chris and Mitch attach a second laser to the original but nothing improves. They check their notes and diagrams. Kent, Bodie and carter chuckle in the corner. INT. AN EXAM ROOM Mitch is taking an exam with a bunch of people he doesn't recognize from the Professor who everyone tape recorded. One of the students appears to be near panic as he deals with a pile of mangled tape. INT. JORDAN'S ROOM-VERY LATE NIGHT Chris and Jordan use a blackboard diagram to discuss the engineering difficulties of Chris' laser supercharger assembly. INT. DORM HALL Chris runs down the hall and enters his room. Mitch is sprawled out asleep under a math text. Chris feels bad about it but wakes him up. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB A wasted Chris and Mitch build the new assembly that will allow a second laser to shoot at the gas jets of the principal laser. INT. DORM LIBRARY-NIGHT Chris is studying hard. Mitch is asleep, his head on the table. MITCH (in his sleep) Please, Vito, not in the mailbox again. CHRIS Mitch! Mitch wakes up. MITCH Oh... I was just reliving some high school highlights. CHRIS Look, you don't have to stay up with me. It's not like we're driving. Get some sleep. You're a growing boy. I hope. Hopsfield enters carrying two large boxes of what appear to be file cards. Mitch is stunned. They all stare for a beat. CHRIS Hi, Laslo. HOPSFIELD I thought you might want some help so I dug into the computer and got every question Artherton's ever asked on every final he ever given. CHRIS Gee, I didn't get you anything. Is that them? HOPSFIELD No, these are entries for McDonald's Sweepstakes. No purchase necessary. Enter as often as you want. So, I am. CHRIS Really? HOPSFIELD This box makes it one million, six hundred thousand. I should win thirty two point six percent of the prizes, including the car. CHRIS Kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? HOPSFIELD I suppose so. But they set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs. CHRIS So where are the questions? HOPSFIELD (insulted) I memorized them. Chris and Mitch look at each other, impressed and a little frightened. MITCH I have to go to sleep now. HOPSFIELD Want my pajamas? MITCH Uhhh...thanks, no. HOPSFIELD Smart kid. He's going to grow five inches in the next year. CHRIS How do you...never mind. INT. MITCH'S ROOM He opens the door and enters. It's dark. FEMALE VOICE Mitch? MITCH (surprised) Jordan? He turns on the light. Much to his surprise and ours, seated on his bed is Sherry Nugil, the girl Chris met at PEI - the genius groupie. She's dressed for the occasion. SHERRY Mitch Simon? MITCH Who? SHERRY I'm Sherry Nugil. And I've been waiting three years for this. MITCH For what? SHERRY For you to be old enough. MITCH For what? SHERRY For this. She kisses him. SHERRY (CONT'D) Are you ready? MITCH For what? SHERRY Why do you keep saying, 'For what?' MITCH 'Cause so far it's working great. INT. JORDAN ROOM-NIGHT Jordan is using a big machine to sand her floors. There's a knock on the door. JORDAN (shouts) Come in. Mitch enters, He appears dazed and disheveled. JORDAN Oh, hi, Mitch. I'm just sanding the floor. MITCH Could you turn that off a second? She does. She starts moving the furniture back. JORDAN What's wrong? Why are you sweating? MITCH I...I just...I came back from helping Chris and there was this woman in my room. Jordan stops, It's the first time we've seen her doing nothing. JORDAN A woman? MITCH (with emphasis) A woman. I mean she was...blessed JORDAN Oh? MITCH And she wanted to...How can I say this so as not to offend you? JORDAN Jump you? MITCH Yeah. I hope you're not offended. JORDAN So what happened? MITCH (excited) She kissed me. Then she took off her clothes. Then I took off my clothes-she had to help me. I kept blacking out - then... it was unbelievable. JORDAN You made it with her? MITCH No. That's what was unbelievable. JORDAN Sure. MITCH It's true. I stopped her and told her I didn't want to. JORDAN Afraid? MITCH No...I mean I really did want to ... but not with her. He looks at her hopefully. She smiles. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-DAY Chris puts the finishing touches on the second laser assembly. He seems pretty pleased with himself. Kent, Bodie and Carter watch conspiratorially. Carter looks at his watch and starts for the door. CARTER Let's go girls BODIE What's that supposed to mean? CARTER It's just a f..f..figure of speech, Bodie. You guys coming to the exam or not? CHRIS (finishing his work) I guess we should, seeing as he's gone to all the bother of having one and everything. They all begin to exit, but then Kent holds up. KENT You guys go ahead. I have to go to the bathroom. CHRIS (exiting) Okay, Kent, but I don't think that's going to help your confidence, do you? The others exit as Kent goes back to Chris' laser, opens it up and starts to fiddle with the works. KENT (to himself) So, Mr. Funny Man, let's see how funny you think this is. INT. ATHERTON'S CLASSROOM-DAY Students wait to begin taking their final exams. Chris, Bodie and Carter enter and take their seats. Atherton is passing out the booklets. ATHERTON You will have exactly three hours. And remember, we believe in the honor system here, people. ANGLE ON KENT He enters and heads for his seat beside Chris. KENT Good luck, buddy boy. CHRIS Is it okay if I name my first child after you? Dipshit Kinsley has a nice ring to it. 5R5DISSOLVE TO: INT. ATHERTON'S CLASSROOM-LATER The students are busy taking the test. ANGLE ON CHRIS He seems to be breezing through it. ANGLE ON KENT He's taking the test. He looks up and is distressed at Chris apparent lack of trouble. Chris looks over and throws Kent a big kiss. Kent turns away immediately. INT. ATHERTON'S OFFICE Atherton is going over some plans. Carmichael ENTERS. Atherton rises. ATHERTON (reprimanding) This is my class hour! CARMICHAEL (loud whisper) We're past the deadline. Don't you understand, Decker's dangerous. We need those plans. ATHERTON (snaps back) It's not ready yet. But it will be. I've got Kinsley cooking now. He'll do it. Believe me, I know how to push that kid's buttons. (rolling up the plans) Here are my drawings for the optics in the sighting system. CARMICHAEL (cutting him off) Decker wants the laser by the end of the week. ATHERTON (close to losing it) I'm doing all I can, damnit! Atherton storms out. INT. CLASSROOM Atherton enters like a dark cloud. He sits at his desk. ANGLE ON CHRIS He finishes his last question. He gets out of his seat. ANGLE ON ATHERTON Sitting at his desk. Chris places his test on the desk. Atherton looks up. ANGLE ON CHRIS AND ATHERTON Chris has a big grin on his face. He takes a piece of paper and writes on it and then slides it in front of Atherton. INSERT The piece of paper. It says, "I aced this." ANGLE ON ATHERTON He writes a message and slides it to Chris. INSERT A piece of paper which reads, "Ace the laser." ANGLE ON CHRIS Chris places an apple on Atherton's desk. He exits. Atherton tosses the apple in the wastebasket. The APPLE EXPLODES. EXT. CAMPUS-DAY Chris is heading for the lab. The place has that look of exam period desertion. CHRIS (muttering to himself) Okie-dokie, doc, a house doesn't have to fall on ole Chris Kinsley. INT. ANTHERTON'S LAB-DAY Chris enters and prepares to test the new equipment. He aligns the secondary laser and let it charge up. He makes some final checks and then throws a switch. The laser fires for an instant but then seems to go crazy. The new laser overheats and the main chamber sparks and smokes. Chris tries to shut it down but to now avail. he tears the cover off in hopes of pulling the wiring, but he's too late. We see everything melting away as the machine eats itself. We also see a message left for Chris just before it too melts. It reads: "1 laser=1car." Chris is on the verge of a complete mental collapse as he watches his work go up in smoke. CHRIS (in anguish) No!!!! There is nothing but the echo of his voice in response. The main laser stands like a huge, frozen bird in the empty room. In anger and frustration he swears at the machine. CHRIS (CONT'D) You bastard. This is your fault. He kicks the wastepaper basket in hopes of getting rid of some of this anger; but, instead, all he gets is the basket bouncing back and hitting him in the shin. CHRIS (CONT'D) Shit! I deserve that. It all comes back on you in the end. He suddenly stands up straight as though he were having a stroke. CHRIS (CONT'D) Holy shit! Inspiration takes hold and Chris begins running around like a madman, gathering up parts to the laser. CHRIS (CONT'D) (almost singing, he's so happy) Of course, it's so simple. Echoes, bouncing back at me and you. EXT. DORM-A LITTLE LATER Chris runs up the stairs three at a time. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM He bursts in. CHRIS Mitch?! The room is empty. The closet door opens and Hopsfield steps out, carrying another box of cards. CHRIS (CONT'D) Laslo! Buddy! Have you seen Mitch? HOPSFIELD No. How did you do? CHRIS (elated) I failed! HOPSFIELD You shouldn't have. CHRIS That's true. But never mind that now. It came to me. The power problem. I solved it. Echoes! It's so simple, four little mirrors. It bounces back and supercharges the gas itself. I've got to find Mitch to help me build it but it should increase the power ten-fold at least. If you see him, tell him to meet me at the lab. Bye. Chris exits, leaving Hopsfield lost in thought. EXT. STUDENT UNION-MOMENTS LATER A hand-painted sign hangs over the door that says: "Exam Week Decompression Here." Chris runs in the door. INT. DECOMPRESSION ROOM-CONTINUOUS The room is full of students who are blowing off steam from studying for and taking exams. They are engaged in all sorts of silly, mindless activities, ranging from tiddly-winks and video games to watching cartoons. There are supplies of "brain food" and health drinks around. Mitch, Ick and Jordan are in the corner. Chris runs up to them. JORDAN Oh, Chris. How did it go? CHRIS Great. It was a snap. But Atherton said he's failing me anyway. JORDAN That's terrible. You must be feeling awful. Are you all right? CHRIS Thank you, Jordan. I do feel terrible but I can't talk about it right now. I need Mitch. Gotta go. Bye. He grabs Mitch and pulls him out. ICK He seems to be handling it all right. 5R5FADE OUT EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE-LATER THAT NIGHT Chris knocks on the front door. Atherton answers the door. He is less than thrilled to see Chris. INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE CHRIS (forcing his way in) Hiya, Jerry, how's it going? ATHERTON What do you want Kinsley? CHRIS World peace, but I don't think this is the time to discuss it. ATHERTON What are you doing here? I've already told you you've burned out and you've failed me and yourself miserably. CHRIS Yes, I know that. But I thought you might be interested. ATHERTON I'm not interested in anything you have to say. Just then a pretty COED starts to come down the stairs. She is dressed only in one of Atherton's shirts. COED Jerry? CHRIS I solved the power problem, Jerry. Atherton pauses. He looks at Chris, then the girl. ATHERTON Debbie, go home. INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-LATER THAT NIGHT Atherton, Kent, Bodie and Carter stand by the laser as Chris explains what he's done with formulas on the blackboard. CHRIS As you know, I was working on supercharging the DF by means of a fusion technique using a secondary laser. Well, when I tried it, I discovered Kent had sabotaged it so it collapsed on itself. Everyone looks at Kent in disgust. CHRIS (CONT'D) And I want to thank him for the thought. KENT What???? CHRIS The Deuterium and Fluorine take up enough space by themselves, right? Well, the mistake we've been making up to now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside source. Big and bulky, right? Well, the elegance of this is that by reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge the whole deal, increasing the power tenfold with no increase in size. KENT This is a complete waste of time. Mitch has been preparing the laser for demonstration. He is struggling to lift several thick metal plates. CHRIS Kent, make yourself useful for once and help put those plates against the wall. Kent does and everyone stands back. CHRIS (CONT'D) Okay, Mitch do it. This should work. Mitch switches on the main laser. It comes to life. Gases flow and a beam appears, hitting the plate without effect. MITCH Now we open the vacuum chamber. He turns a valve and the beam begins to heat up the plate. CHRIS So far so good. And now, cross your fingers. He throws a switch. There's a beat. And then, suddenly, the beam glows intensely brighter, cuts through the plate, the cabinets behind it and through the wall out into the night. Chris and Mitch jump shut the whole thing off. CHRIS Sorry about the wall, sir. KENT (looking through the hole) And the tree across the quad. ATHERTON (in awe) Screw the wall, you did it! You really did it. KENT (petulant) I've done my part, too. ATHERTON (ignoring Kent) Okay, Kinsley. You did it. You pass. CHRIS Thank you, sir. ATHERTON And I think we can get that job back for you at PEI. KENT (apoplectic) What! You can't. That's my job. I've done everything you've ever asked. I get your laundry, and I finished the mirror. Look. Kent runs out of the room as Mitch and Chris exchange a look and Atherton shakes his head. Kent returns, rolling a circular precision mirror one meter in diameter. KENT See! Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a film virtually 100 per cent reflective, one micron thick and apply it to a mirror this shape? ATHERTON Good, Kent. (to Chris, in a hurry) I have to go. I have a pressing... He exits. MITCH (very happy for Chris) Let's celebrate. CHRIS Absolutely. Kent, you with us? KENT (totally frustrated) Oh...eat me. EXT. CAMPUS-NIGHT Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan are looking at the laser hole in the tree. EXT. LIBRARY-NIGHT They look at where the beam has cut a hole through the head of the statue of Dr. Bradford. EXT. STREET-NIGHT They look high up at a hole where the beam went through a telephone pole and then across the street, even higher, where it burned through a billboard on top of tavern. They cheer. INT. BAR-LATER Our group is celebrating. The jukebox blares. Chris and Ick are drinking beers; Mitch and Jordan are holding hands, sharing a milkshake and feeding each other French fries. MITCH I don't think I'm ready for that yet. Maybe we should wait a year; at least until I get my license. JORDAN I understand. There are a lot of things to be considered here. For example, I could drive. Hopsfield enters and sits down at the table. Everyone stares for a beat. HOPSFIELD (to Chris) I've been thinking about your laser solution. (a beat) I figure you've increased the output to six megawatts. CHRIS Yeah. HOPSFIELD What would you use that for? MITCH The applications are unlimited. Industrial for one. HOPSFIELD With the gas tanks you've designed the beam would only last for forty seconds. What good is that? CHRIS I don't care, Laslo. I graduated. MITCH Let the engineers figure out a use for it. That's not our concern. HOPSFIELD Maybe somebody already has a use for it, one for which it's perfectly designed. JORDAN You mean Atherton had something in mind all along? HOPSFIELD Looks at the facts: very high power, portable, limited firing time, unlimited range. All you'd need is a big spinning mirror and you could vaporize a human target from space. Hopsfield gets up and walks outside. Silence for a beat. CHRIS This is not good. ICK You want another beer? MITCH How big a mirror? INT. HALLWAY-EARLY MORNING Chris, Mitch, Ick, Jordan and Hopsfield run down the hall and enter the lab. ANGLE- THE LAB The laser is gone. INT. HALLWAY Chris runs next door and forces Kent's lab door open, looks in. INT. KENT'S LAB They all enter. CHRIS The mirror is gone, too. Atherton, you worm! You pig! You fuck! Kent, you too! Chris is venting his rage on every inanimate object in the room, kicking and punching. CHRIS (CONT'D) I should have seen it! How could I have not seen it! MITCH He lied to us. CHRIS It's easy to lie to you. You trust people! I'm cynic! What an asshole I am! HOPSFIELD I understand how you feel, Chris, and you're right. But what we should be doing now is trying to find out what he's doing. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-NIGHT Chris and Mitch sit waiting. Chris is very despondent. Very. Jordan enters. MITCH Did you do it? JORDAN I put a receiver in it too. (referring to Chris) Is he okay? MITCH I don't know he stopped talking about an hour ago. May I see it? She holds out her hand and we see an almost microscopic electronic device. Ick enters carrying several gas masks, a gas bottle, some tubing an atomizer. ICK Ready? INT. DORM HALLWAY -MOMENTS LATER Mitch, Jordan and Ick are gathered around the closed door to Kent's room wearing the gas masks. Ick feeds the end of the tube under the door and opens the valve on the bottle. ICK We'll have two minutes. A STUDENT walks by, not batting an eye. STUDENT Hi, guys. INT. KENT'S ROOM The gas has knocked Kent out. He sleeps peacefully in a chair. The door opens and our gang enters. JORDAN (to Mitch) Open his mouth. He does and she pulls out some dental tools and goes to work, placing the receiver in Kent's mouth. JORDAN (cont'd) It was his braces that gave me the idea. They're a perfect antenna. His whole.. ICK It's about time someone put it to good use. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER They all huddle around a homemade radio transceiver. MITCH (disguising his voice, into a microphone) Kent. Kent. Wake up, Kent. INT. KENT'S ROOM-SAME TIME Kent begins to stir. We can HEAR Mitch's voice coming from Kent's head. At first he thinks he's dreaming. MITCH (V.O.) I'm talking to you, Kent. KENT What? MITCH (V.O.) I said I'm talking to you. KENT (shaking his head, violently) No! MITCH (V.O.) Yes. KENT (slapping himself) I'm not asleep. I must be overworked. MITCH (V.O.) You're not overworked, Kent. KENT Well, I'm not insane! Silence. KENT (CONT'D) Am I? INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM MITCH That remains to be seen, Kent. But we are having a conversation. INT. KENT'S ROOM KENT I have to metabolize this. Um... who is this? MITCH (V.O.) This is Jesus, Kent, and you've been a very naughty boy. KENT (cracking up, laughing) All right! Who is this?! Bodie? Carter? MITCH (V.O.) I am known by many names. I am the One. Turn to me and be saved. KENT Oh, Sure. MITCH (V.O.) Cut the crap, Kent, you've built a weapon. KENT How did you know that? MITCH (V.O.) I know everything. KENT Oh. God. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM MITCH That's right, Kent. Where is the laser now? INT. KENT'S ROOM KENT I can't tell you. MITCH (V.O.) How would you like to burn for the rest of time? KENT (panicking) No, they're testing it on the twenty-seventh but I don't know where. It's classified. MITCH (V.O.) Oh. KENT What? MITCH (V.O.) Nothing. I want you to think about what you've done and repent, and from now on, stop playing with yourself. KENT I don't...okay INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM MITCH Now what? The closets door opens and Hopsfield appears. HOPSFIELD Phase two. INT. STEAM TUNNELS They are near Hopsfield's lair. Hopsfield has removed the cover from an enormous terminal. Chris seems remote and depressed. HOPSFIELD This is the phone terminal for the entire school. MITCH Okay, we tap Atherton's office phone. What about his home? ICK All the faculty's home phone are part of the University system. JORDAN (enthusiastically, looking at the maze of wiring) Great, all we have to do is find it! HOPSFIELD We'll find it. Jordan and Hopsfield set to work searching for Atherton's lines. Ick is concerned about Chris. ICK I'm depressed. Why did I listen to my parents? I should have become a ping-pong pro. HOPSFIELD It's not too late. MITCH You shouldn't be depressed. It's us he used. JORDAN Downtown Schmidlap. MITCH Excuse me? JORDAN (Still working) Ernie "Downtown" Schmidlap. From my high school. He was captain of everything. One day he told me he wanted to "date me up." so for a month he'd come over and I'd do his homework for him. He was going to take me to the prom. But once he passed his courses, he took Roberta Preen. I stayed home and re-wired our housekeeper's TV. ICK That's awful! MITCH You think that hurts? You should've met my Uncle Stan. He was a Weasel. ICK That bad, huh? MITCH No, that was his lodge. The Royal order of Friendly Weasels. Every Wednesday when I was eight, he'd take me down to his lodge meeting and he'd challenge people to call out two five-digit numbers. I had to multiply them in my head faster than a guy could do it on a calculator. They'd bet on me. Of course, after the meeting, he'd take me for ice cream. ICK That's nice. MITCH Well...he'd take me to the supermarket and I had to dip my hand in. HOPSFIELD I've got his office. JORDAN I've got his home. INT. STEAM TUNNEL- SOMETIME LATER They've all made themselves comfortable as they sit and wait for the phone tap to produce results. Hopsfield has wired a speaker so that they can hear, CHRIS Why doesn't your phone ring, you jogging, syphilitic microbe? ICK (sotto, to Mitch) I think he's coming around. Suddenly, from the speaker, we HEAR the sound of Atherton's phone being picked up. ATHERTON (V.0./FILTER) Hello VOICE (V.O.) Is this Jerome Atherton? ATHERTON (V.O.) Yes, it is. VOICE (V.O.) This is Bill Carlisle. I saw your television show the other night about the reproductive system. ATHERTON (V.O.) Thank you, I hope you enjoyed it. VOICE (V.O.) I love it. Everything you said was copied word for word from my book and I expect a lot of money for it. ATHERTON (V.O.) Need I remind you, it's public television, an attempt to teach people something. And all you can think of is personal greed. It's people like you that make me feel bad about being American. VOICE (V.O.) I'm Canadian ATHERTON (V.O.) I'm not surprised. Good day. They hang up. ICK God, he's good at that. He almost gets away with it. That's the most manipulative guy I've ever seen... I mean heard. CHRIS He does get away with it. MITCH Not anymore. INT. STEAM TUNNEL-LATER STILL Everyone lies asleep in various places and positions, Mitch awakens. He is amazed to find Jordan asleep on his shoulder, so amazed he has to wake her. MITCH Jordan? JORDAN Hmmmmmmmm. MITCH You were sleeping. JORDAN I was? Gee (snuggling) I guess you relax me. MITCH (proudly) Wow! CHRIS (awakening) What's going on? MITCH I put Jordan to sleep. CHRIS And you're proud of that? MITCH Yeah. The speaker comes to life with the sound of the receiver being groped for and then Atherton's groggy voice. ATHERTON (V.O.) (mumbling) Yes...hello DECKER (V.O.) Jer? Dave Decker How are you? ATHERTON (V.O.) Christ, Dave what time is it? DECKER (V.O.) Nine thirty here in Washington. I thought you Californians all get up early and exercise. Ha, ha CHRIS This is it. That's the guy I saw at his house with the daughter. ATHERTON (V.O.) Very funny, Dave. What do you want? I'm busy. DECKER (V.O.) It sounds like it. Listen, I'll be out there tomorrow for the test but I want you to go to the Marsh this afternoon and check optics systems one more time. ATHERTON (V.O.) Why? DECKER (V.O.) Because I'm in charge, Doctor. Goodbye. He hangs up. All look to Chris. ICK Well? CHRIS (comes to life) It's happening. MITCH It's only weapon if it works, right? CHRIS (determined) You're absolutely right! The time has come, people. No more being used. No more Downtown Schmidlaps or Uncle Stans or Jerry Athertons. We're going to take responsibility for our own brains. Remember, without ethics there can be no morality. Without morality there is no society and without society there can be no fast food restaurants. So the whole country, nay, in the world, is counting on us to get even in a big way. Thank you. ICK Nice logic. CHRIS Thanks. Synchronize watches. MITCH Why? CHRIS It's just something you say at a time like this. HOPSFIELD I don't need a watch. CHRIS Okay, forget it. Let's go. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE-DAY Atherton comes out and heads for his car carrying an over-night bag. As he drives away we SEE that Ick has been spying on him. EXT. A FILED-DAY Ick is hiding behind some bushes on a knoll. he is looking through binoculars. ICK POV Atherton's car is passing through a high security gate into Marsh field. EXT. SHIPPING DOCK-DAY Chris, Mitch and Hopsfield are loading the last of several large boxes into a beat-up van. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE-EVENING The van pulls up in front. Painted on the side is a plumber's logo. Mitch, Jordan and Ick start unloading boxes. Chris goes to the front door. ANGLE ON THE DOOR. Chris picks the lock. INT. HOPSFIELD'S LAIR-LATER THAT NIGHT Chris and Mitch enter to see Hopsfield as he works at the computer, attempting to interface with another computer. Each time he hits the keys the READOUT replies "Negative." HOPSFIELD Boy, these secret fields are so untrusting. CHRIS So we can't get on-base clearance. HOPSFIELD I guess not. CHRIS Forget it. We'll balls it. Jordan enters carrying two I. D. cards. JORDAN How do these look? INSERT Two fake I. D.'s with Mitch's and Chris's picture on them. Perfect. I hope. ANGLE BACK ON THE ROOM MITCH What if they don't fool anybody? CHRIS They shoot us. EXT. MARSH AIR FORCE BASE- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT Technicians check monitors and prepare for the coming test. Nearby stands a firing command module very reminiscent of the pilot's compartment in the opening sequence. Atherton goes over last minute details with various people. He seems distracted as an engineer discusses a problem with him. ENGINEER Are you all right? ATHERTON What? Oh, yes, fine. Have you ever had a feeling that there's something terribly wrong? ENGINEER No. EXT. MAIN GATE OF THE BASE-NIGHT There are two Air force Police GUARDS in the shack. Chris and Mitch pulls up in Kent's Citroen, behind a government sedan awaiting clearance at the gate. They are dressed as technicians and Mitch sports a moustache. INT. THE CITROEN Mitch is a wreck and Chris doesn't help. He begins humming the theme from "Mission Impossible." GUARD (V.O.) All clear, Mr. Decker. Just follow the yellow line. Chris accidentally hits the horn. Through the windshield we SEE Decker and the guard look back. Chris recognizes Decker. CHRIS (covering) How long does it take? Mitch whimpers. Decker's car pulls away. The guard uses one finger to motion Chris forward. Chris pulls the car up. The guard leans in the window. GUARD I.D. Mitch, obviously shaking, hands his to Chris who hands them to both guard. CHRIS Snap it up, will ya? We just flew in. We're tired. We're hungry. We have this stupid car. The guard turns away and walks into the shack. MITCH Are you out of your mind? CHRIS You have to intimidate these guys. The guard returns. GUARD You're not on the list. CHRIS Of course not. We're classified. We HEAR the phone RING. The second guard answers it. INT. COMMAND CENTER An Air Force Officer is on the phone. An impatient Atherton stands beside him. ATHERTON I don't know what he should look for, just tell him if he sees anything out of the...let me tell him. He grabs the phone. INT. THE CITROEN GUARD Aren't you guys a little young to be technicians? CHRIS Lasers are a young science. There, fine, now you've made me say it. Now we're all in trouble. Mitch looks like he's going to die. GUARD Look, I'll call the duty officer. He starts towards the phone shack. The other guard is still on the phone. CHRIS (his demeanor changing) Excuse me. The guard turns back. CHRIS (CONT'D) Look, pal, don't call anybody. We're four hours late. It's our jobs. Give us a break, will ya? Someday you might be in the private sector, right? A beat. Mitch dies. Chris gives the guard a goofy grin. EXT. THE GATE The guard waves them through. The car pulls away. The guard returns to the booth. SECOND GUARD We're supposed to look for anything out of the ordinary. FIRST GUARD Okay. EXT. THE RAMP - NIGHT A B-1 Bomber, painted black, sits in the glow of the work lights. Technicians, who are wearing jumpsuits similar to the ones Mitch and Chris have on, are busy working around the plane. Chris and Mitch ENTER FRAME and walk up to the plane. A couple of the technicians watch them curiously as they go up the stairs into the bomb bay. INT. BOMB BAY Chris and Mitch enter. Three technicians are inside the plane running last minute checks on the laser, which sits in the middle of the cabin. Chris crosses to the technician who is in the middle of the cabin. He watches him making mental notes as he checks the program. The technician turns, sensing his presence. CHRIS Nice work. Keep it up. Mitch, meanwhile, checks out the laser optics. After a beat, one of the technicians signals for the others to complete their jobs and exit. They start to file out. One of them turns and looks at Chris, who is just standing there. CHRIS What?! The technician shakes his head uncertainly and exits with the others. Finally, Mitch and Chris are alone. Chris opens the BRIEFCASE. It contains a cellular phone, a modem and an EEPROM Processor. INT. HOPSFIELD'S LAIR - SAME TIME The computer receives a signal. Hopsfield turns to Jordan and Ick. HOPSFIELD We've got a connection. They're in. INT. BOMB BAY CHRIS Get the EEPROMs. Mitch opens up the computer and clips a couple of power lines and pulls out four computer chips and hands them to Chris, who plugs them into the processor. Chris picks up the phone. CHRIS (into phone) Abbott to Costello. INT. HOPSFIELD'S LAIR Jordan picks up the phone. JORDAN (into phone) This is Costello. Go ahead, Abbott. INT. BOMB BAY CHRIS (into phone) Costello, who's on first? Mitch hits him impatiently. CHRIS (CONT'D) We've got the goodies. JORDAN (V.O.) We have the target coordinates computed for trajectory adjustment. CHRIS Great. Shoot. INT. HOPSFIELD'S LAIR Hopsfield's computer screen fills with machine code of ones and zeros. He begins searching through many screens of code. HOPSFIELD Oh, oh. ICK What? HOPSFIELD Oh, nothing. INT. BOMB BAY Chris and Mitch freeze as a mechanic walks by the open bomb bay door. INT. COMMAND CENTER - EARLY MORNING Technicians are checking monitors and a radar scope at a control panel. Atherton is in the rear of the room briefing a group of civilians and military brass. Amongst them is Decker. Atherton points to a drawing on a large chart. ATHERTON The plane will reach an altitude of sixty-five thousand feet. When it is over, the target will fire the laser from here .... (points to the firing module) ... for five point two seconds. Carmichael enters. CARMICHAEL They're all set for the final onboard check. ATHERTON Fine. Right this way, gentlemen. They all follow Atherton and Decker to the exit at the rear of the room. INT. BOMB BAY Chris and Mitch sweat it out. INT. HOPSFIELD'S LAIR Hopsfield is scanning the screens. HOPSFIELD I think I've found it. May I have the coordinates, please. ICK (reading from paper) Thirty-four degrees, ten minutes, fifteen seconds North; one hundred eighteen degrees, nine minutes, three seconds West. Hopsfield enters the data into his computer. JORDAN (into phone) We're sending. INT. BOMB BAY CHRIS (into phone) We're taking. Mitch suddenly panics as he looks out. MITCH'S POV Atherton and his group come around the corner of a building and head for the plane. ANGLE ON MITCH AND CHRIS MITCH They're coming this way. CHRIS (into phone, overly calm) You may be interested in knowing that Mitch reports that Herr Professor is approaching and I'm not even sweating. Isn't that remarkable? INT. HOPSFIELD'S LAIR JORDAN Please hurry. Atherton's coming. HOPSFIELD (typing furiously) Please, I don't work well under pressure. He finishes. HOPSFIELD (cont'd) There. I hope that does it. JORDAN (into phone) Okay, Chris ... I mean Abbott. Hello ... hello ... hello ... EXT. BOMBER Atherton and his group approach and enter the bomb bay. INT. BOMB BAY As they enter, there is no sign of Chris and Mitch. Atherton checks out the laser and the computer. The others examine various gauges and switches and the flight deck. CARMICHAEL Everything all right? ATHERTON Of course. EXT. BOMBER As the group exits the plane, Chris and Mitch drop out of the forward landing gear well in the background. ATHERTON (turning back) Oh, I forgot ... ATHERTON'S POV A glimpse of Chris and Mitch as they disappear around the corner of the building. CLOSE ON ATHERTON Uncertain of what he has just seen. CARMICHAEL (O.S.) What is it? ATHERTON Nothing. INT. DORM LIBRARY - PRE-DAWN Kent looks the worse for wear as he sits surrounded by psychology books dealing with schizophrenia. MITCH (V.O.) Hi, Kent. KENT (surprised) Oh, I thought you were gone. MITCH (V.O.) Not yet. Have you been touching yourself? KENT Yes. I mean, no. INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM - SAME TIME MITCH (into mike) Good, Kent. Dad, my father, you know, God, wants to show you something. KENT (V.O./FILTER) Why? I mean, what? MITCH I've learned not to ask. INT. DORM LIBRARY MITCH (V.O.) He wants you to wait on the sidewalk at six thirty nine Ivy Crest Drive at precisely six-oh-eight this morning. KENT Ivy Crest? MITCH (V.O.) Just wait there and you shall receive a sign. Do not despair and do not go inside. KENT Why not? Hello? Hello, Jesus? A student walks in and looks at him strangely. INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAWN Atherton and company watch the bank of monitors as the flight controller clears the bomber for take off. EXT. CAMPUS - DAWN Chris and Mitch jump into the van and drive off. INT. COMMAND CENTER Some monitors show the bomber climbing while others show the desert target area. It is a mock up of a Presidential motorcade. The open cars are filled with test dummies, and are linked together and are being towed slowly across the desert by a tractor. CONTROLLER (into mike) Crossbow One, radar contact. Climb and maintain flight level six five oh. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE The van pulls up and parks across the street. Chris and Mitch get out. Just then, a Volvo pulls up and Jordan, Ick and Dr. Meredith get out. Dr. Meredith is wearing a bathrobe, pajamas and slippers. MEREDITH Ah, Mr. Kinsley. Why am I not surprised to see you here? Perhaps you have the explanation for this so-called event I'm suppose to witness. CHRIS Yes, sir, I do, but first may I take this opportunity to compliment you on your fashion sense. INT. CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER (into mike) Crossbow One, turn left to two eight zero. PILOT (V.O./FILTER) Two eight zero, roger. A technician hits a switch and a monitor pops on. Crosshairs dominate the center of the screen. The desert floor rushes by. Atherton turns to a specialist standing by. ATHERTON Norman, if you'd be so kind. This cockpit mock-up duplicates the shuttle flight deck and we've placed it here to demonstrate the firing technique. The specialist takes his place inside the command module. PILOT (V.O./FILTER) We are thirty one DME from the target. CONTROLLER (mike) Roger, Crossbow. Open the doors. INT. BOMB BAY The doors open to reveal clouds rushing past and the ground far below. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE MEREDITH These are rather strong accusations, Chris. CHRIS Yes, sir, I know. MEREDITH If they're true, I'm going to need some proof. CHRIS I think we're going to be able to accommodate you in just a minute, sir. Looking past Meredith, Chris sees Kent approaching. ANGLE ON KENT as he arrives at the house and stars up at it. He glances at his watch and waits impatiently. INT. COMMAND CENTER Inside the firing module, the specialist pulls down the target sighting device and puts his hands on the joysticks. SPECIALIST Power on. CONTROLLER T minus fifty and counting. INT. BOMB BAY The large mirror lowers into its firing position and the laser powers up. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE - MORNING The group watch Kent, who is nervously pacing back and forth, talking to himself. CHRIS (to Mitch) Boy, if this works, he's going to start a new religion. MITCH If it doesn't work ...? Chris shoots him a censoring look. INT. COMMAND CENTER This countdown continues. Monitors display the target sight, the pilot's sighting screen of the ground and a camera's view of the bomber. TECHNICIAN Trajectory command relay, locked. ATHERTON Now, Norm here has firing control. ANGLE ON TARGETING MONITOR The target motorcade is sighted. INT. BOMB BAY The laser mirror and sighting lens move in unison as they line up on target. INT. COMMAND CENTER The crosshairs line up on the sighting monitor. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE JORDAN What's he doing? THEIR POV Kent has now started toward the front door. MITCH I told him not to go in! CLOSER ANGLE ON KENT KENT (muttering to Jesus) Look, this is Jerry's house, we're very close, so if you're not going to answer me, then I'm going in ... He reaches for the front door. KENT (CONT'D) ... here I come. ANGLE ON CHRIS AND MITCH CHRIS (shouting) Kent! Stop! ANGLE ON KENT who turns and sees them. INT. COMMAND CENTER Everyone is riveted to the sighting monitor. SPECIALIST Target locked. In ten, nine, eight ... As the countdown continues. INT. BOMB BAY The computer comes to life and electronically unlocks the laser optics from the sighting camera. The mirror turns to the left. INT. COMMAND CENTER The aerial view of the motorcade remains centered on the sighting monitor. INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE Kent opens the front door and enters. KENT (to himself) That looked like Dr. Meredith in a bathrobe. First I'm hearing things, now I'm seeing things. He closes the door. KENT (CONT'D) Okay, God. Let me have it. The room is dark, lit only by morning light coming through a large stained glass window at the top of the stairs. In the middle of the room is what looks like a large above-ground swimming pool, covered in aluminum foil. Kent is amazed. INT. COMMAND CENTER SPECIALIST ... three, two, one, bingo. He hits the trigger. INT. BOMB BAY The laser fires. EXT. SKY The laser beam traces through the atmosphere. INT. COMMAND CENTER The group waits expectantly. Nothing happens to the target. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE Chris and Mitch, who are running toward the house, are stopped in their tracks by the incredible sight of the red laser beam shooting down out of the heavens, striking the grass, tracking across the lawn then up the wall of Atherton's house. INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE The beam strikes the window and for one tiny moment causes the most incredible light show anyone has ever seen. KENT (in awe) Oh! The window is obliterated by the laser light, which crashes down directly onto the aluminum foil-covered pool. KENT (CONT'D) Oh, my! The foil is heated instantly in the laser light and there is the SOUND of tiny explosions, building to a roar. In a second, the foil rises violently and tears open. Kent picks up a piece of debris and examines it. KENT Popcorn? In the next instant, he is engulfed in popcorn. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE The beam disappears as suddenly as it came. Everyone stands in awe. A few kernels fly out of the broken window, then a storm. INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE Kent and furniture are being forced up the stairs by a rising tide of popping popcorn. He struggles against it, loses, and sinks into the mound like a dinosaur in quicksand. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE The windows are filling up with popcorn. Finally, they crack and break as popcorn forces its way out of the house wherever it can. MITCH Kent! Chris and Mitch head for the front door. Suddenly, it bursts open and Kent is carried out by a moving wall of popcorn. INT. COMMAND CENTER People furiously check systems. CARMICHAEL I don't understand. Did it fire? TECHNICIAN Yes, we indicate a shot. We've got another problem, though. It's not shutting down. INT. BOMB BAY The computer is still working. The laser optics and equipment begin to melt. It's been wired to self-destruct. INT. COMMAND CENTER The devastated group watches the laser self destruct on the monitor. DECKER Nice going, Jer. ATHERTON Something's wrong here. Unlock the bird's eye. He takes over the command module sighting system ATHERTON I'm tracing where the shot went. We watch as the monitor's view swings away and across a residential neighborhood, coming to rest on a bird's eye view of his own house. ATHERTON (CONT'D) Oh, no. The monitor view moves in to reveal what looks like a growing mushroom. DECKER What have you done? ATHERTON Retired. EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE The group looks on as the mountain of popcorn continues to engulf the house. Meredith goes to see if Kent is all right. CHRIS (to Mitch) Do you think we used too much? MITCH Maybe a little. CHRIS Well, I guess we all learned something here today. JORDAN What? CHRIS I don't know, but it seemed like the right thing to say, didn't it? ICK It did to me. As they continue to watch the destruction of the house, and various neighbors come out to see what's what, a Winnebago pulls up and stops. Hopsfield gets out. HOPSFIELD I think you used too much. CHRIS Really? I'm sorry you missed it. HOPSFIELD Yeah, well, I had to pack. CHRIS Why? HOPSFIELD I'm getting married. CHRIS What? To whom? MITCH (looking at the U-Haul) What is all this? HOPSFIELD Oh, I won. Only thirty-one point eight percent though. I have to figure that out. But not this summer. Mitch suddenly sees Sherry standing at the Winnebago door. MITCH Sherry? SHERRY (kissing Hopsfield) Hi. Isn't it wonderful. I finally found him. Number One. I've been looking for him for ten years. HOPSFIELD What can I do? She loves me. CHRIS Right. Congratulations. HOPSFIELD Thanks. Anyway, we probably won't ever get to see you again, so, bye. CHRIS What do you mean? Where are you going? SHERRY I've got a little survival place in Wyoming. We're going to live there. HOPSFIELD Yeah, it's getting too weird around here. See ya. They climb into the Winnebago and it pulls away. The others watch it go. ICK You think it's getting too weird around here. CHRIS Absolutely. JORDAN I didn't notice. MITCH I like it. In the background, the popcorn has split the walls of the house and finally lifts the roof off like the top of a pot. The whole house tilts to its side and the popping stops. As we PULL BACK, Atherton's car pulls up and he gets out, dumbstruck. Dr. Meredith walks over to him and confronts him. Kent joins Chris and the others who watch. THE END.

                                           SECOND DRAFT

                                           February 19,
1999




       FADE IN:

       EXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAY

       It's raining lightly in the harbor and the
       water around the moored boats looks dirty and
       cold.

       We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in
       an end slip.

       It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin
       cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long
       time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood
       addition has been nailed to the top of the
       cabin. It's partially covered with a blue
       plastic tarp.

       SUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -
       FALL

       The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked
       torso emerges from under it. Shane is late
       twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly
       going to seed. He looks hung over.

       Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He
       pulls on the top part of an old patched wet
       suit and zips it up. He shivers.

EXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY

We're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in
an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.

Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood
to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty
oblong of his face is visible.

It's still raining as he steers the little
boat around the sailboats and yachts.

He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS
the ENGINE.

With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to
the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a
bill for services rendered on the sailboat's
stern line.

He slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of
old gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a
air-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out
of the dinghy and into the    water.


EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

It's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane
floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long
spatula.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He attacks the underside of the sailboat
which is covered with green algae muck that
hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.

The spatula scrapes away the green mess
revealing the pure white underside of the
boat.


CLOSE ON SHANE

As he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats
past him. This doesn't look like fun.

As he works, he happens to look down and
notices something on the bottom.

SHANE'S POV

Amidst the beer cans and other trash,
something golden is sitting on the bottom.


BACK TO SCENE

Shane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it
go and drifts down.

A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky
water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried
in the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks
it up.

The trophy is almost a full-size football
rendered in bronze attached to a broken base.

Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. He
grips the seams like he's done this before.

Then he holds the football out in front of
him.

Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals
to an imaginary offense. He turns to his
running back as he yells something like "Blue
31!" It comes out in bubbles

He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver
goes in motion.

Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five
step drop.

He moves in slow motion because hey... he's
underwater! He executes a perfect play
action fake on the third step of his drop,
and looks "down field" for his receivers.

But there's a blitz! He steps up in the
pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes
his head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves
in a kind of delicate ballet.

He rolls left and keeps looking for the open
man.

Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and
cocks his arm.

The "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps
forward in a perfect release.

      The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON
      Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he
      throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.

      We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of
      victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the
      trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del
      Rey.

         CUT TO:


       EXT. EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL STADIUM (WASHINGTON,
D.C.) -
       DAY

      Bam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a
      Washington Redskin running back and lands on
      his throat, elbow first.

      It's a beautiful fall day in November and
      Miami is beating the Skins in front of
      seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans.
      The Redskins are at their home stadium better
      known as "The Big O."


      INT. CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

      JOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the
      game in shirtsleeves.

                        SUMMERALL
                That play, my friends,
                sums up the Redskins'
                running game all day
                long. Now Washington
                calls their last time
                out.

      Madden leans over to do his diagram that
      shows up on your TV screen. We STAY ON him
      as he draws and explains.

                        MADDEN
                Hey, the Dolphins do
                this as good as
                anybody. See, in a
                four, three, two, two,
                you got the guards...
                boom!... Plugging up
                the middle, then the
                corners... boom and

         boom!     Are free to
         box...    leaving the
         middle    linebacker to
         cut off    the trap
         here...    boom!

                 SUMMERALL
         Third and twenty-two,
         but forget the first
         down with eight seconds
         showing and the Skins
         down by a touchdown.

                 MADDEN
         Could be the last play.

                 SUMMERALL
         Could be the last play
         of the season if the
         players go out.


EXT. SIDELINES - DAY

Redskin quarterback EDDIE MARTEL is
conferring with Redskin head coach BUD TILDON
near the bench. Madden and Summerall
continue OVER.

                 MADDEN (V.O.)
         Take it all in, people.
         This could be it for
         2,000.

We MOVE TO veteran Redskin center REESE
EVANS, 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform
totally clean.

He looks near tears.

                 SUMMERALL
         (V.O.)
         Once again, if you
         haven't heard, it was
         announced during
         halftime that the
         N.F.L. Players
         Association will hold a
         press conference
         immediately following
         this game -- that would
         make it about five
         o'clock Eastern time --
         and it is expected that

            the players' union will
            announce a strike
            effective immediately.


ON REDSKINETTES

Twelve striking-looking women dressed in
burgundy and gold are doing some inane
chatter to a section of fans that ignore
them.

The girls are led by pretty ANNABELLE
FARRELL, a bundle of manic energy inside a
body from heaven.

                    MADDEN (V.O.)
            It's all about money,
            folks. More money, of
            course and ain't it
            always? The shame of
            it is the big losers
            are you out there, the
            fans.


ON MARTEL

The Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.

                    SUMMERALL
            (V.O.)
            Here we go: Third
            down, eight seconds to
            play, ball on the
            Dolphins' thirty-three
            yard line. Skins down
            by a touchdown.

The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the
center.

                    MARTEL
            Green 48! Green 48!
            Hut! Hut!

The ball is snapped and Martel drops back.
He looks for a receiver and doesn't see
anybody.

He steps up in the pocket, sees an opening
and takes off running down field.

                   MADDEN (V.O.)

          There goes Martel!

Martel is a pretty good broken field runner
for a big guy. Plus with the defense
covering every possible receiver, he's got a
lot of daylight.

Nobody has touched him as he crosses the
fifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller than
Martel, looms in front of him at the ten.

Martel goes down in one of those wimpy
quarterback slides before the safety can even
hit him.

BANG!   The GUN sounds and the game is over.


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

They look at each other in disbelief

                  SUMMERALL
          Well... Martel goes
          down ten yards short of
          a score.

                  MADDEN
          On maybe the last play
          of the season.

                  SUMMERALL
          I think he might have
          slipped.

                  MADDEN
          Yeah, there's a lot of
          that going around.


ON THREE REDSKIN FANS

We'll see these guys throughout. They're
typical low level Washington bureaucrats
named TODD, ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs
-- the traditional name for the Redskin
offensive linemen.

Todd is shirtless and his entire upper body
is painted Redskin red.

At that moment, they are livid with their
quarterback and Bob is speaking for them all.

                    BOB
         We're    coming to your
         house    tonight, and
         we're    gonna fucking
         kill    you! And if you
         got a    dog, we're gonna
         kill    your fucking dog
         too!

INT. LARGE BEDROOM - DAY

The room's blinds are pulled tightly against
the bright sunlight. Only the blue light of
a TV illuminates anything.

Suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give
out with a loud piercing wail.

The door to the room bangs open and an
English male nurse named AUGUSTINE RIPLEY,
dressed in white, comes running in. He's
carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at
the ready.

He runs to the bed of    the still wailing
EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL    (75). O'Neil is hooked
up to an oxygen tank,    watching the just
completed Redskin game    with the sound off.

                 AUGUSTINE
         Did they win or lose?!

O'Neil continues to wail.

                 AUGUSTINE
         That has the distinct
         tonal quality of a
         loss.

He puts one needle down and jabs O'Neil with
the other one.

He murmurs to the old man as he injects him.

                 AUGUSTINE
         Nice medicine for a
         loss. Keeps us calm.
         Makes us not so sad.
         Keeps us on an even
         keel. Gives us some
         perspective, doesn't
         it? And we'll save the
         winning medicine for
         next Sunday, won't we?

He finishes.

                 O'NEIL
         If you keep talking to
         me like I'm a five-
         year-old, I'm going to
         hurt you.

                 AUGUSTINE
         Sounds exciting.

He reaches for the phone and hits the speed
dial.

                 AUGUSTINE
         We'll want to talk to
         coach now, won't we?

He hands the phone to O'Neil.

                 O'NEIL
                (on the phone)
         What the fuck was
         that?!

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. TILDON'S OFFICE

Coach Tildon sitting in his office. We can
hear players getting dressed, listening to
MUSIC and getting SHOWERS outside his open
door.

                 TILDON
                (on the phone)
         I think he slipped.

                 O'NEIL
         Bullshit he slipped!
         He could have scored!

         Anybody could have
         scored! I got one foot
         in the god damn grave
         and I could have
         scored!

                 TILDON
         Mister O'Neil, let's
         face facts: The
         players are going out.
         It's gonna happen. And
         nobody wants to get
         hurt on the last play
         before a strike that
         could go on for the
         rest of the season.

                 O'NEIL
         You god damn wimp!
         You're fired! Get out!
         Get out! Get out!

O'Neil throws the phone down. Augustine
picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a
notch.

O'Neil takes big gulps of the rich air.

                 AUGUSTINE
         Better? It always
         makes you feel better
         when you fire someone,
         we know it does, don't
         we? Yes...

                 O'NEIL
         Get me Jimmy McGinty.
         Get him here. Tonight.

O'Neil sucks hard on the oxygen.

INT. REDSKINS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

A REPORTER is interviewing WILSON JONES, the
huge defensive end for the Redskins. Wilson
wears an enormous diamond earring.

Wilson is dressing at his locker.

                 WILSON
         Hey, man, I do what my

         union says.

                 REPORTER
         But you're already one
         of the highest paid
         players in the game.
         The fans just don't see
         the point of a player
         like you striking.

                 WILSON
         Let me tell you
         something: I'm a big
         man, you see?

Wilson holds his arms out.   Yes, he's
gigantic.

                 WILSON
         There are some days
         when I am so beat up,
         that I cannot dress my
         own big ass. I asked
         management for a valet
         or some shit to help me
         dress and they said no
         way. So, fuck 'em!

                 PLAYER (O.S.)
         Shut up everybody, here
         it is...

Somebody turns UP a TV in the locker room.


ON TV

A handsome ex-player named Jerome Lindell
steps up to a podium at a press conference.
He's wearing a two thousand dollar suit.

On the TV he is identified with a super:

"JEROME LINDELL -- President -- National
Football League Players' Association."

                 LINDELL (V.O.)
         I have just left a
         meeting with
         representatives of the
         owners and I am sad to
         say that they have
         refused the players'
         final demands which

         center around a rise in
         the current salary cap.
                 (MORE)

                       LINDELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
         Therefore, I am
         recommending that all
         N.F.L. players walk out
         and not play until our
         demands are met. I
         want the players to
         walk out tall, to walk
         out righteous, to walk
         out in the knowledge
         that we do this as a
         team. We shall
         overcome the fat cats.
         I send peace to my
         union brothers.

The entire locker room is silent for a beat.
And then everyone starts getting dressed
again, maybe a little slower than before.

INT. O'NEIL'S BEDROOM - CLOSE ON O'NEIL - NIGHT

As he sleeps peacefully.    The only sound is
the HISS of his OXYGEN.

Then we hear ICE CUBES SLOSHING in a glass.

O'Neil opens his eyes and sees:

JIMMY McGINTY, a handsome devil in his late
sixties, wearing golf clothes and sipping the
last dregs of a Scotch rocks.

                 McGINTY
         You look like shit.

                 O'NEIL
         I'm dying, Jimmy.

                  McGINTY

         You been dying for
         twenty years.

O'Neil motions to the glass. Jimmy pours
three fingers from a Glenlivet bottle and
hands it to him.

                 McGINTY
         That poof of a nurse of
         yours is gonna kick my
         ass if he catches you
         drinking.

O'Neil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey.
He smiles as it goes down.

                 O'NEIL
         Gimme a butt.

                   McGINTY
         I quit.

                   O'NEIL
         No.

McGinty nods.

                 O'NEIL
         You pussy. I want you
         to come back as head
         coach. I fired that
         asshole Tilden today.

                 McGINTY
         I'm retired. And
         besides, you don't have
         a team. They all flew
         home in their jets to
         their castles.

                 O'NEIL
         We're gonna finish the
         season anyway. All of
         us owners decided.
         We're gonna use
         replacement players.

                 McGINTY
         You're a bunch of
         greedy bastards, aren't
         you?

                 O'NEIL
         Us, greedy?! What

         about the god damn
         players?! I got the
         highest payroll in the
         N.F.L. and they still
         want more!

                 McGINTY
         That's because you've
         been bottle-feeding
         straight cash to these
         big babies for years.

O'Neil sips his whiskey and calms down.

                 O'NEIL
         No team owner in their
         right mind is gonna
         give back those T.V.
         revenues.

         All we promised Fox was
         twenty-two guys with a
         pulse every Sunday.
         But think about it,
         Jimmy. We got a great
         opportunity here! We
         got a chance to put a
         team on the field that
         plays the game just for
         the love of it. Like
         we used to play it.

                 McGINTY
         We also used to play
         without face guards.

                 O'NEIL
         Jimmy, I'm really
         dying. The doctor says
         I'll be gone by
         Superbowl Sunday. Help
         me bring a winner back
         to D.C. You did it for
         me once before. You
         can do it again.

                 McGINTY
         Listen: I golf once a
         week with the President
         of the United States.
         I walk my grandkids to
         school every day. I

         got a    young wife who
         will    fuck me any time I
         want,    which frankly,
         isn't    too often, but
         it's    comforting to know
         it's    there. I don't
         need    it.

                 O'NEIL
         Come on. Wouldn't it
         be fun? A bunch of
         poor nobodies who play
         to win instead of a
         bunch of bitchy
         millionaires? You can
         put it together, Jimmy.
         Player's love you.
         They always have.

McGinty pours more Scotch and looks into the
glass.

                 O'NEIL
         Tell me you're gonna do
         it.

                 McGINTY
         Shut up, I'm thinking.
                (pause)
         Okay. Here's the deal:
         you let me recruit who
         I want, with no
         interference?

                 O'NEIL
         Absolutely.

                 McGINTY
         I'm talking anybody I
         want. No exceptions.
         And no interference
         with my coaching,
         either, like you used
         to.

                 O'NEIL
         Sure, Jimmy, sure.

                 McGINTY
         And one more thing: no
         more Notre Dame
         stories. You start
         telling me Notre Dame
         stories and I pull your

         plug personally.   I
         swear to God.

O'Neil smiles.

INT. REDSKINS' HEAD COACH'S OFFICE - DAY

McGinty is sitting behind the empty desk as
his two main coaches give him a presentation.
They are offensive coordinator LEO
PILACHOWSKI and defensive coordinator
CHRISTOPHER BANES.

                 PILACHOWSKI
         ... Six phone lines
         with internet access on
         two: One for defense
         and one for offense.

                 BANES
         We thought we would
         skip special teams for
         the moment.

                 PILACHOWSKI
         Except for a kicker.
         We definitely need a
         kicker. A place kicker
         over a punter.

                 BANES
         The thinking being that
         if we lose the toss, we
         have to be able to at
         least kick off.

Both coaches laugh nervously.     McGinty
doesn't say anything.

                 PILACHOWSKI
         Okay. Here's the list
         of every player cut
         this past season. What
         we would like to do
         is...

                  McGINTY
                 (interrupting)

         Those people?
                (pointing to
         list)
         Most of them were cut
         because they were
         shitty.

McGinty takes out a piece of paper of his own
with a bunch of names on it.

                 McGINTY
         We're going to go
         another way here. I've
         done some scouting
         since I retired. On an
         ad hoc basis, of
         course. And what I
         have here is a list of
         people I've kept an eye
         on. They've all played
         football somewhere, but
         only a few in the pros.
         And they've all got
         something... unique to
         bring to the game.
         We're gonna take these
         people and try to put
         together a winning
         team. And if nothing
         else, they should be
         fun to watch.

McGinty looks up when he senses someone
standing in the doorway. It's REESE EVANS,
the veteran Redskin we saw standing on the
sidelines with the clean uniform.

                 EVANS
         You won't need a
         center.

                 McGINTY
         How you doin', Reese?

                 EVANS
         Bored and ready to
         retire. I'm just
         looking for one more
         hit. One more really
         good hit.

                 McGINTY
         What about the strike?

                 EVANS
         Hell, I'm rich. I got
         no complaint with
         Mister O'Neil. I just
         want a chance to play
         one last time.
                 (MORE)

                 EVANS (CONT'D)
         Shit, I'd rather go out
         with a broken leg than
         sitting on the bench.

McGinty nods to Pilachowski. The coach takes
a marker and fills in "Evans" in the center
circle.

                 McGINTY
         Welcome to the new
         Washington Redskins.
                (to his coaches)
         Let's find Reese

INT. METHAMPHETAMINE LAB - DAY

A bunch of BIKER types are cooking up a vat
of speed. These guys are big, and
badasslooking.

After a beat, one of the Bikers looks up at
the door.

                 BIKER
         Did you hear something?

The other biker shakes his head, no.

The one who asked the question walks over to
the door and listens for a beat. Nothing.

He turns to go back and suddenly the door
disintegrates in front of a charging man
wearing a "police" windbreaker.

This is DANIEL    BATEMAN, a big,    young,
psychotic cop,    who immediately    runs over the
poor Biker who    was listening at    the door,
kicking the guy    in the head as    he goes by.

Bateman dives on two more Bikers, and

viciously head-butts one of them.

He stuffs the other's head into the meth
mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a
big police blackjack, three quick times:
Rap! Rap! Rap!

The guy goes down like lead.

Bateman looks around and spots a big BIKER
cowering in a corner. The Biker is
terrified.

Bateman takes two stops toward the guy when
suddenly three more COPS wearing windbreakers
run in, out of breath.

They look around at the unconscious Bikers.

                 COP #1
         Jesus, Bateman! Why
         don't you ever wait for
         us?!

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Someone's BEEPER is
going off. The three cops look at theirs.
Nothing.

The cowering Biker looks at his.

                   BIKER #2
         Not me.

Bateman pulls his beeper, studies it and
looks puzzled.

                 BATEMAN
         What area code is 703?

INT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

A loaf of Wonder Bread is spinning through
the air in SLOW MOTION. It comes AT us,
twisting and turning.


ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

He's tall, maybe 22, and positioned behind
the cash register. He's wearing a Washington
Redskins sweatshirt.

Clifford's hands are up as he waits to catch
the bread which was tossed by his MANAGER at
the back of the store.

The loaf hits Clifford's hands and then
bounces out. It lands on the counter in
front of a TEN-YEAR-OLD smart-ass KID.

                          KID
         Nice hands.

                 CLIFFORD

         What else?

                 KID
         A pack of Marlboro
         Reds, a pint of Martel
         Cognac and a box of
         Trojans, extra long.

Clifford grabs the Kid's two one-dollar
bills, and makes change for the bread.

                 CLIFFORD
         Get out of here. I'm
         telling your mother you
         were talking like that.

The Kid leaves.

The Manager yells from the back of the store
as he holds up a portable phone.

                 MANAGER
         Hey, Clifford, somebody
         on the phone wants you
         to play football next
         weekend.

                 CLIFFORD

                   (on phone)
            How much?
                   (pause)
            Ten thousand five
            hundred dollars!

                    CLIFFORD
                   (stunned)
            Ray, who the fuck is on
            the phone?!

                    MANAGER
                   (pause)
            It's the Washington
            Redskins!

Clifford collapses.

INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

We hear deafening APPLAUSE as we hold on
ANDRE and JAMAL WILLIAMS, two huge
bodyguards, dressed in identical black suits.

Suddenly,   the artist formerly known as Prince
comes off   stage, grabs a towel from an
assistant   and starts walking with Jamal in
front and   Andre in the rear.

As they walk, a CELL PHONE RINGS. Andre
pulls it from his pocket and answers it,
quietly.

Jamal runs interference with the techies and
groupies backstage.

                 JAMAL
                (to someone)
         Get out of the way!
                (to someone
         else)
         Don't look at him! He
         don't like being looked
         at, god damn it! No
         eye contact!

As they walk, Andre is still talking on the
phone.

Finally, they get to the backstage door and
stop. The rock star prepares to run the
gauntlet of adoring fans behind his trusty
bodyguards.

But his bodyguards are conversing quietly but
urgently with each other.

One of the assistants throws open the door.
A big mob waits outside.

The anointed one turns to his bodyguards to
lead the way, but... they're gone!

The mob surges. The artist formerly known as
Prince screams as he's trampled to death by
his fans.

  CUT TO:


EXT. MARINA DEL REY - DAY

Shane Falco, wearing his patched wetsuit,
climbs out of his inflatable dinghy and flops
onto the deck of his cabin cruiser.

He looks cold and tired.

                 McGINTY (O.S.)
         You look like a
         swordfish I caught
         once.

Shane jumps.

McGinty is sitting in an old deck chair on
the stern of the boat.

                 McGINTY
         He hit the deck just

         like that.

Shane studies his visitor.

                 SHANE
         And you look like that
         coach from the
         Seventies. From the
         Redskins. McGinty.
         Except you look a
         shitload older.

                 McGINTY
         The price of happiness.
         Something to take the
         chill off?

He offers Shane an elegant flask.   Shane
takes it and drinks.

                 McGINTY
         I'm running the
         Redskins again. And I
         want you to quarterback
         'em.
                 SHANE
         No, man, I've been out
         way too long.

                 McGINTY
         What, three years since
         San Diego dumped you?
         That's nothing. You're
         in shape, flopping
         around in the water
         like that.

                 SHANE
         You know what my
         nickname was in San
         Diego, don't you?

                  McGINTY
         Sure.   Footsteps.

                 SHANE
         As in, I hear 'em and I
         dump the ball.

                 McGINTY
         Well, you didn't have
         much of a line to
         protect you.

                 SHANE
         I got two concussions
         to prove it.

                 McGINTY
         That's why girls don't
         play the game.

McGinty drinks from his flask.

                 McGINTY
         I scouted you when you
         were playing at Ohio
         State. I told San
         Diego they were
         probably making a
         mistake when they
         signed you.

                 SHANE
                (truly shocked)
         No kidding?

                 McGINTY
         Oh, you had a lot of
         tools: a quick
         release. Fast. A
         scrambler by nature.
         Good downfield vision.
         But you got hurt a lot.
         And worst of all, you
         never could win the big
         game. What did you
         lose the Sugar Bowl by,
         your senior year?
         What, forty points?

                 SHANE
         Forty-five. And now
         you want to recruit me?

                 McGINTY
         A scrambling
         quarterback is gonna do
         real well in this new
         replacement
         environment. And to
         tell you the truth, I
         think I can help you
         with your biggest
         problem.

                  SHANE
         Okay.   What's my

         biggest problem?

                 McGINTY
         Courage. I think that
         Sugar Bowl took it all
         out of you.

There's a beat as Shane looks away.

                 SHANE
         I'm retired from
         football.

                 McGINTY
         Yeah, and it looks like
         things have been going
         really well for you
         since.

Shane doesn't meet McGinty's eyes.

                 SHANE
         I like being here.
         It's quiet. I like
         being alone.

                 McGINTY
         Yeah. No screaming
         crowds, that's for
         sure.
                (pause)
         You know what separates
         the winners from the
         losers? Gettin' back
         on the horse. The one
         that kicked you in the
         teeth. You're still
         young. You still got
         bags of talent. If you
         do well, who knows what
         will happen when the
         strike ends?

Shane keeps staring out at the water.

                 McGINTY
         You want me to tell you
         you're not going to get
         hurt? You know you
         will. No doubt about
         that. But, hell...

McGinty points to the boats in the harbor.

                 McGINTY
         ... Wouldn't you rather
         get hurt than scrape
         the shit off of other
         guys' toys?

EXT. QUEENS (NEW YORK) - DAY

We're right off Queens Boulevard on a busy
side street where LOU PACIFICO, 30, is taking
book. Lou is short, dark and handsome.

He leans against the wall of a liquor store.

                 PASSERBY #1
         Deuce and an eightball
         on Go Down, Rita in the
         eighth.

Lou writes quickly on a small pad.

After a beat, another passerby leans in and
whispers something to Lou. Lou writes
quickly again.

>From across the street an old woman sticks
her head out of a four-story walk-up. This
is LOU'S MOTHER who speaks with a heavy
Italian accent.

                 MOTHER
         Louis, you got a phone
         call!

                 LOU
                (from across the
                 street)
         Who is it?

                 MOTHER
         It's the Washington
         Foreskins.

                 LOU
         What?! Ma, what are
         you, out a your tree?

                 MOTHER
                (yelling louder)
         I'm telling you they
         said it's the

         Washington Foreskins!
         Foreskins! Foreskins!
         Foreskins!

People in the street are now starting to look
up at this old woman screaming "Foreskins!"

Louis quickly crosses the street to his
apartment house.

But at that moment, a soccer ball bounces
toward him from where a group of kids are
playing in an alley.

Out of pure instinct, Lou gives it a mighty
boot.

We FOLLOW the arc of the ball as it sails
DOWN the block. Everyone stops to admire the
kick.

Still airborne, the ball crosses Queens
Boulevard.

At that moment, a very old mafioso type is
being helped from his limo by several
lieutenants.

Pow! The ball hits the old guy right in the
back of the head, knocking off his porkpie
hat and dropping him to the pavement like a
bullet.

The lieutenants pull pistols and surround
their fallen leader.


ON LOU

He sees what happens and quickly ducks into
his apartment house.


ON ONE MAFIA LIEUTENANT

He spots Lou before he disappears inside.

  CUT TO:


EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Coach ROLAND LAMONT, a good-looking ex-
running back in his late twenties, is

coaching a high school player.

We can see that Roland is wearing a pretty
substantial knee brace.

He holds up a football.

                 ROLAND
         Cut right on me, now.
         Right on me.

He pitches the ball out to one kid, who runs
right at him, steps on Roland's foot with his
cleats and then cuts around him.

Roland screams and falls to the ground.

                 ROLAND
         Not right on me,
         goddamn it!

He writhes there a beat until he hears:

                 VOICE (O.S.)
         Coach Lamont! Phone
         call! Long distance.
         Washington, D.C. It's
         the Washington
         Redskins!

Roland holds his foot and manages a smile
because he seems to know what the phone call
means.

                 ROLAND
                (to the sky)
         Thank you, Lord!

EXT. BIG O (WASHINGTON D.C.) - MAGIC HOUR

The stadium appears empty.

Suddenly, a football thrown with a perfect
spiral comes AT us.


REVERSE ANGLE

We see the ball sail cleanly through a rubber
ring attached to the crossbar on the
goalpost.

ON SHANE FALCO

He's in shorts and a sweatshirt taking snaps
from center Reese Evans.

                 EVANS
         Nice. Try a roll to
         the right.

Evans bends over another ball.    Shane sets up
in the shotgun.

                 O'NEIL (V.O.)
         Shane 'Footsteps'
         Falco? This is what
         you're going to build
         an offense around?


EXT. STANDS - MAGIC HOUR

McGinty is sitting with O'Neil on the fifty
yard line twenty rows back.

Augustine holds O'Neil's oxygen tank as the
old man sits huddled in a coat that's way too
big for him.

                 O'NEIL
         Christ, Jimmy, I ask
         you to build me a team
         based on balls and the
         first player I see is
         Footsteps Falco?!

                 McGINTY
         He's got as much
         natural talent as any
         quarterback in the
         league.

                 O'NEIL
         And he's got the
         happiest feet I've ever
         seen!

                 McGINTY
         All he needs is a shot
         of self-confidence.
         He's our quarterback.
         That's the way it is.

                   O'NEIL
           What about a safety?
           We got two a days
           starting tomorrow and a
           game in five days! And
           we still don't have a
           safety?!

O'Neil motions to Augustine for more oxygen.

                   AUGUSTINE
           Here we go. Nice fat
           little hits.

He turns the valve up.   O'Neil breathes
deeply.

                   O'NEIL
           I called a friend of
           mine who just happens
           to be the Governor of
           Maryland.

                   McGINTY
           Terrific, the Governor
           is going to play
           safety?

                   O'NEIL
           Don't worry about it.


ON SHANE

He drills a perfect spiral through the
circle.

  CUT TO:


EXT. BIG O - MORNING

A ramp at the rear of the stadium gives
vehicle access to the interior. The bottom
of this ramp is now a maelstrom of activity.

The regular Washington Redskins are in a
picket line walking in circles. The players
are dressed in everything from fur coats to
expensive leather jackets and leather pants.
Half of them are on cell phones.

We can see some of their cars parked
haphazardly nearby: BMWs, Porsches,

Mercedes, etc.

Jerome Lindell, the president of the
Players' Association, is being interviewed on
camera by a REPORTER.

                 REPORTER
         As president of the
         Players' Association,
         what does your presence
         mean here, Mister
         Lindell?

                 LINDELL
         Very simply, support
         for these fine players
         and union men.
         Washington D.C. is the
         home of freedom and the
         collective bargaining
         agreement. I am here
         to remind all Americans
         that the owners are no
         better than the robber
         barons of the
         Nineteenth Century.
         They have blatantly
         gone out and hired
         scabs, which is against
         all principles of our
         Constitution and the
         Declaration of
         Independence and
         probably even the
         Emancipation
         Proclamation.

The picketers start shouting and pointing.

                 LINDELL
         And here come the
         Scabskins now!

A bus slowly makes its way towards the ramp
and the picketers.


INT. BUS - MORNING

Shane is sitting in the first seat with Reese
Evans (center).

We MOVE BEHIND them and see, among others,
Daniel Bateman (psychotic cop), Clifford

Franklin (can't catch a loaf of bread), Jamal
and Andre Williams (ex-bodyguards), Lou
Pacifico (kicker and bookmaker), and Roland
Lamont (ex-high school coach).

BANG! EGGS start HITTING the bus WINDOWS.
We can hear the regular players chanting:

                    PLAYERS
            Scabskins! Scabskins!
            Scabskins!


ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

He's very excited as he looks out the window
at the striking players. Roland Lamont sits
next to him.

                    CLIFFORD
            Oh God, there's Eddie
            Martel! And Wilson
            Jones! I love Wilson
            Jones! Yo, Wilson!
            Yo, player!


ON WILSON

His big face looms right outside the bus
window. He looks pissed off and scary.


ON LOU PACIFICO

He leans across his seat to Shane.

                    LOU
            Hey, Lou Pacifico.

Shane shakes his hand.

                    SHANE
            Shane Falco.

                    LOU
            I know. I lost a ton a
            money on that Sugar
            Bowl disaster of yours.
            Wow. Did you get your
            butt kicked or what?


ON JAMAL

He's looking out the window when an eeg
splats against it. He turns to his brother
Andre:

                 JAMAL
         You know I don't take
         that shit.

Jamal reaches into his jacket and starts to
pull out a nine-millimeter pistol.

Andre stops him.

                 ANDRE
         Be cool.


INT. BOWELS OF STADIUM - DAY

A nondescript van pulls up and a muscled,
deadly-looking guy in handcuffs and jail
issue clothes gets out. This is bearded
safety EARL (he-ain't-no-girl) WILKINSON.

A Maryland state trooper unlocks the cuffs.
Earl looks... hungry.


EXT. STADIUM - DAY

The replacements are getting off the bus as
the players chant.

                 PLAYERS
         Scabskins! Scabskins!

When Reese Evans (former Redskin center) gets
off the bus, the players go wild.

Reese coolly gives them the international
suck my dick sign.

Clifford gets off behind him. He waves and
smiles at the striking players.

They throw rotten fruit at Clifford in
return.

INT. EQUIPMENT ROOM - DAY

SID, an oldtimer equipment man folds towels.
Behind him, we can see helmets, pads, etc.

McGinty walks up dragging Shane who is fully
dressed in a uniform, including helmet.

                   McGINTY
                  (to Sid)
           What is this?

McGinty points to the intricate face guard on
Shane's helmet.

It's an exaggerated version of a lineman's
cage with so much metal criss-crossing that
you can hardly see Shane's face.

                   McGINTY
           He's a quarterback!
           How is he supposed to
           see?

                   SID
           He told me he was a
           linebacker!

                   SHANE
           I can see.

McGinty holds up three fingers.

                   McGINTY
           How many fingers?

                    SHANE
           Two.   No, wait.    Three.

  CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD - DAY

Andre and Jamal are hitting the blocking sled
simultaneously. They drive it OUT OF FRAME.


ON SHANE

He's now wearing a helmet with a twobar
quarterback face guard. He takes a snap and
pitches out to running back Roland Lamont.

Roland, now wearing a big knee brace, looks
sharp as he cuts to the outside.

ON PILACHOWSKI

The offensive coordinator is standing with
McGinty who is concentrating on the
scrimmage. Suddenly, Pilachowski spots
someone. His mouth drops open.


ON MICKEY LEE

He's a fourhundred-fifty-pound ex-Sumo
wrestler crammed into a Redskin uniform.     Fat
rolls are visible everywhere.

                 PILACHOWSKI
         Oh my God. That's
         disgusting!

Lee walks up. McGinty bows and says
something in Japanese. Lee bows and answers
back in Japanese. Then they shake hands.

                 McGINTY
         How you doin', Mickey?

                 LEE
         Not bad, Coach.

                 McGINTY
         You look great. Why
         don't you work out at
         left tackle?

                 LEE
         You got it.

Lee puts on his helmet, pulls his ponytail
out the back and rumbles away.

Pilachowski is looking at McGinty like he's
crazy.

                 PILACHOWSKI
         You're not serious.

                 McGINTY
         I met Mickey in Hawaii.
         When he was even
         bigger. He's a Sumo
         wrestler. That means
         he's an expert at
         pushing people around.

         That's what pass
         blocking is, Leo.

Defensive coordinator Christopher Banes comes
running up in a lather.

                 BANES
                (to McGinty)
         I got a defensive end
         who's deaf!!

                 PILACHOWSKI
                (watching Lee
         walk
                 away)
         I'll trade you for a
         tackle who's gonna play
         in a diaper.

                 BANES
         How can I coach a deaf
         man?!

                 McGINTY
         You don't have to...

He looks across the field at a big, good-
looking kid named BRIAN MURRAY who is in the
middle of a pass rushing drill.

Murray looks really fast, especially for his
size.

                 McGINTY
         Brian Murray would have
         gone in the first round
         five years back if he
         hadn't been born deaf.
         I first saw him play
         right here in D.C. for
         Galludet College. He's
         a hell of an athlete.
         You won't have to tell
         him anything.

                 BANES
         I can't believe it! I
         got to be able to
         communicate with him.

                 McGINTY
         Then learn to sign.
         Hey, look at it this
         way: He'll never get

           pulled off sides on an
           audible.

McGinty thinks this is funny as shit.


ON SHANE

He's just done a fivestop drop on a pass
play. He's looking down field when he sees
something scary.

                   SHANE
           Oh shit! No!

He throws the ball away and then is nailed
and taken down on his back by Bateman
(psychotic cop).

Shane groans and lies there with Bateman on
top of him.

                   BATEMAN
           Hi, I'm Danny.

                     SHANE
                    (groaning)
           Shane.

McGinty pulls Bateman up.

                   McGINTY
           Nice pop, Danny.

                   BATEMAN
           Thank's, Coach!

Danny runs off.

                   SHANE
           What was that?

                   McGINTY
           Danny Bateman. Ex-cop,
           ex-Marine, ex-rugby.
           He's absolutely
           harmless, if you just
           play dead.

McGinty helps Shane up.

                   McGINTY
           San Diego used you all
           wrong. You're not a

            drop back passer.
            You're a scrambler.
            Like you were in
            college. So, we're
            gonna roll out. A lot.
            Get used to setting up
            on the run. You'll
            live a lot longer.

                    SHANE
            I'm very interested in
            that.

PRACTICE MONTAGE

A)    BATEMAN

      is lined up at middle linebacker. When
      the play starts, he runs headlong into
      four blockers and takes them all down
      with him.

B)    WIDE RECEIVER CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

      beats his man, and turns as Shane,
      rolling out to his left, puts the ball
      right on his numbers. Franklin drops it.

C)    ANDRE AND JAMAL

      On the snap, they pull to lead a sweep.
      Unfortu-nately, each thinks the play is
      to their side. They forearm each other
      and then get into a fight.

D)    LOU PACIFICO

      boots one from thirty-five yards through
      the uprights. He smiles, takes out a
      Marlboro Light and a Bic and fires up.

E)    CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

      pulls up, does a button hook and Shane
      puts the ball in his hands. Franklin
      drops it.

F)    LEE

      the Sumo guy, hits the blocking sled and
      turns it over.

G)   BATEMAN

     is down on the ground viciously punching
     another player as two assistants try to
     pull him off.

H)   FRANKLIN

     is in a crossing pattern in the end zone.
     Shane puts the ball right in front of
     him. Unfortunately, it hits him in the
     hands.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Shane is sucking down water from the portable
water cart when head cheerleader Annabelle
Farrell walks up. She's dressed in tight
workout clothes.

          Annabelle Farrell, head
          Redskinette.

                  SHANE
          Excuse me?

                  ANNABELLE
          I'm in charge. Of the
          Redskinettes. The
          cheerleaders?

                  SHANE
          Oh yeah, hi.

                  ANNABELLE
          I've been watching you.
          You look good. You
          look strong. Good
          quick release. Smart.
          You read defenses
          quickly. You're gonna
          do great.

                  SHANE
          Hey... thanks.

                  ANNABELLE
          I saw your second
          concussion. The one

         against Cleveland.
         Pow! You could hear it
         in the cheap seats.
         But you completed the
         pass. That's what
         counts.

                 SHANE
         I guess so.

                 ANNABELLE
         If there's anything you
         need, let me know. And
         I mean anything, okay?
         You understand?

Shane is really not sure.

                  SHANE
         Sure.   I understand.

                 ANNABELLE
         They put you up at the
         Hilton?

                  SHANE
         Yeah.

                 ANNABELLE
         Good. Remember:
         anything. You got it?
         Okay?

Shane nods.   She walks away.

We watch her world-class ass move across the
gridiron.


ON McGINTY AND CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

McGinty is holding a ball and talking to his
wide receiver.

                 McGINTY
         ... because it's a damn
         waste of all that
         speed, Clifford. I
         told you that when you
         were in high school.
         You've got to catch the
         ball, son. This is the
         main idea of the
         passing game.

                 CLIFFORD
         I know, Coach, I know.

                 McGINTY
         Okay. I assume that
         you have touched a
         woman in a romantic
         way, have you not?

                 CLIFFORD
         Oh yeah, Coach, sure.
         In a, you know,
         romantic way.

                 McGINTY
         Good. From here on
         out, you touch this
         football, all the
         time...

He shoves the football in Clifford's hands.

                 McGINTY
         ... just like you touch
         your girl friends. I
         better not see you
         without this ball. You
         understand?

McGinty starts to walk away.

                 CLIFFORD
         Coach, wait! Can I
         still like touch my
         girl friends if I
         don't, you know, let go
         of the ball?

McGinty thinks about that.

                 McGINTY
         Yes, Clifford, if you
         can manage that,
         absolutely.

Microphones are in his face and video cameras

ON MICKEY LEE AND ROLAND LAMONT

Mickey is watching Roland unbuckle his big
complicated knee brace. (NOTE: There should
be something slightly medieval about this
brace.)

                   MICKEY
           You only played one
           game?!

                   ROLAND
           Actually, less than two
           minutes. I was a
           rookie third round pick
           in '93. We were
           playing Atlanta in the
           home opener. Near the
           end of the first
           quarter, they sent me
           in, I took a screen
           pass over the middle
           and got hit by both
           linebackers.
           Simultaneously. One a

         side. My knee turned
         into wet toilet paper.
         End of career.

                 MICKEY
         Can you play on it now?

Roland takes out a wrench and starts
unscrewing a bolt on his brace.

                 ROLAND
         I've been teaching high
         school football for
         five years. It's not a
         bad life. I'm good at
         it. There are some
         days when I actually
         love it. But for one
         more shot at this?
         Shit. I'd give it all
         up. This time, they're
         gonna have to take me
         out in a box.


ON EARL WILKINSON (CRIMINAL)

He's standing naked in front of his locker
staring with anticipation at a garment bag.

Slowly, he unzips the bag revealing a
beautiful new suit. He touches the lapels
reverently.


ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

He's sitting in front of a locker, holding
his football, with a shit-assed-eating grin.

Someone walks by.

                 CLIFFORD
         I got Wilson Boone's
         locker, man. Do you
         believe that shit?

He drops his ball and quickly picks it up
again. He looks around to make sure Coach
didn't see him.

  DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BIG O PARKING LOT - MORNING

The regular Redskins are out in force,
holding signs as they lean on their Beamers
and Porsches.

Shane pulls up in a battered '89 Honda.

When he gets out, he's immediately surrounded
by six striking regulars, led by quarterback
Eddie Martel and defensive end Wilson Jones.

                 MARTEL
         Hey, you can't park
         there.

                 SHANE
         Look, I don't want any
         trouble.

                 MARTEL
         You don't want any
         trouble?! You're
         taking my job away, but
         you don't want any
         trouble?
                (to Wilson)
         He doesn't want any
         trouble, but he puts
         this piece of shit in a
         no parking zone.

Shane looks but it's obvious he's parked
legally.

                  SHANE
         Okay.   I'll move it.

                 MARTEL
         No, we'll do that for
         you. Go ahead, Wilson.
         Move it for him.

Wilson motions to another big guy. The two
of them proceed to roll the Honda over on its
roof. It lands with a crunch.

                 JAMAL (O.S.)
         You all put that car
         back.

Everybody turns to see Andre and Jamal
walking towards them.

                 WILSON
         Who the fuck are you?

                 ANDRE
         We're the people who
         take care of the
         quarterback. We're the
         guards.

All the regulars laugh at this.

                 JAMAL
         Put the car back.
         Gently.

                 WILSON
         Kiss my ass.

                 SHANE
                (to Jamal)
         It's okay.

                 JAMAL
         No, it's not.

Jamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue
Porsche.

                 JAMAL
                (to Wilson)
         That's your ride, ain't
         it?

Before Wilson can even answer, Jamal pulls
his NINE MILLIMETER. BOOM! BOOM! No more
Porsche windshield.

All the regular Redskins dive for cover.

                 WILSON
         My windshield! You
         crazy motherfucker!

                 JAMAL
         Move his car back.

                   WILSON
         My car!

Jamal raises his GUN again.    POW!   No Porsche
driver's side window.

                  WILSON
         No!   Stop!

He turns to his cowering teammates.

                 WILSON
         Come on, help me, god
         damn it!

The guys quickly pick up the Honda and put it
right side up.

                 WILSON
                (to Jamal)
         You are gonna pay for
         this.

                 JAMAL
         No I'm not. And quit
         messing with my man
         here. That includes
         his ride.

Jamal spins the nine and holsters it.

Andre and Jamal get on either side of Shane.
They look at each other and then quickly
switch sides.

                 ANDRE
         Let's go to practice,
         Shane.

                 SHANE
         Let's do that.

Shane smiles at his guards, smiles at the
still-shocked Redskins, and they move out.

INT. LOCKER ROOM BATHROOM - DAY

Shane, dressed in pads and pants, opens the
door and walks in. During the opening and
closing of the door we hear:

                       ASSISTANT COACH (O.S.)
         ... so if anyone does
         have any firearms, we
         need to turn those in
         as soon as possible, no
         questions asked...

Shane stands in front of the urinal and goes

through the painstaking process of locating
his dick.

First he wrestles open his football pants and
then has to deal with the cup, etc.

Next to him, at another urinal, is WALTER
COCHRAN, a big, serious bornagain tackle.

As he pisses, Walter has his Bible propped
open behind the flush handle so he won't miss
a minute of scripture.

                 WALTER
         Praise the Lord, Shane.

                  SHANE
         Yeah.   Sure.

                 WALTER
         Walt Cochran.
         Offensive tackle.

Shane nods.   Walter pees for a beat.

                 WALTER
         Shane, will you witness
         with me?

                 SHANE
         Will I what?

                 WALTER
         Will you witness with
         me? For this upcoming
         practice.

                  SHANE
         Now?

By now Shane is pissing too.

                 WALTER
         Praise the Lord for
         giving us a way to
         eliminate, Shane. Why
         not talk to Him in the
         midst of performing his
         gift?

Walter takes his hand off his whizzing member
and holds it out to Shane.

Shane looks at Walter's hand for a long time,

but finally, he removes his own guiding hand
and clasps Walter's hand tentatively.


REVERSE ANGLE

They continue pissing as they hold hands.

                    WALTER
            Heavenly Father, thank
            you for allowing us to
            pee the poisons from
            our systems. Please

Mickey Lee is gnawing on a two-foot slab of
ribs.

Lou Pacifico has a little three card monty
going at a picnic table.

Coach    McGinty is holding up a beautiful baby
girl    to the admiring players. He kisses the
baby    and then hands the child to his gorgeous
young    wife.

Augustine is pushing Mister    O'Neil in a
wheelchair. They pass the     outside bar and
O'Neil suddenly lunges for    a bottle of
tequila. Augustine has to     rip it out of his
hands.

Coach Banes and Earl Wilkinson (criminal) are
talking to a distinguished-looking big man in
his fifties. This is a D.C. CIRCUIT COURT
JUDGE.

                 BANES
         Where did you play,
         Judge? Wait. Do I
         call you judge?

                 JUDGE
         Your Honor, or Judge is
         fine. I played at
         Harvard. But I played
         in the days when you
         went both ways.
         Offense and defense.
         When players were
         really tough.
                (to Wilkinson)
         And where did you play
         college ball... I'm
         sorry, what was your
         name again?

Wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous.

                 WILKINSON
         Smith. Ray Smith. I
         played at a junior
         college nobody ever
         heard of. What
         position did you play
         on defense, Judge?

                 JUDGE
         Middle linebacker.

                 WILKINSON
         Yeah, big fellow like
         you, that's what I
         would have guessed.

                 JUDGE
         It was a different game
         in those days. Raw.
         Powerful. No tricks,
         like today.

                 WILKINSON
         You know, maybe you can
         show me some of your
         technique, Your Honor.
         Maybe you can show me
         some of that toughness.

                 JUDGE
         I'd be glad to!

There's an evil glint in Wilkinson's eye.

Shane is standing alone in a large hallway
looking at an enormous trophy case stuffed
with the spoils of football.

                 ANNABELLE

         You would think he's
         done enough.

Shane turns and sees her.    She's as fetching
as ever.

                 ANNABELLE
         McGinty, I mean.

                 SHANE
         I was kind of thinking
         the same thing.

                 ANNABELLE
         My theory is he came
         out of retirement to
         see if he could win
         with losers.
                (pause)
         Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
         I didn't mean...

                 SHANE
                (interrupting)
         Hey, it's okay. I've
         been called worse.

                    ANNABELLE
         Like    after that Sugar
         Bowl    game? I guess you
         could    survive anything
         after    that.

Shane has to actually smile at this.

                 SHANE
         Sometimes I feel like
         everybody in the world
         saw that game. Like I
         could go to India and
         some little guy would
         run up to me and say,
         'Boy, did you suck in

         the '92 Sugar Bowl.'

Annabelle laughs.

                 SHANE
         So, how come you're
         such a fan?

                 ANNABELLE
         My dad. He's a huge
         Redskin fan. For
         years. He's in his
         twenty-ninth year at
         the Senate Office
         Building. As a guard,
         not a senator. The
         only thing that keeps
         him going he says, is
         me and the Redskins.
         That's where I get it.
         My fan-ness.
                (suddenly)
         Are you scared?

Shane is totally taken off guard by this
woman.

                     SHANE
         Scared? Well... yes.
         Absolutely.

                 ANNABELLE
         It's okay. Anybody
         would be. But you're
         good. And you'll do
         good.

                 SHANE
         Well, thank you. Look,
         I gotta study the play
         book tonight. So...
         I'll see you.

                 ANNABELLE
         Break a leg tomorrow.

                    SHANE
         What?!

                    ANNABELLE
         It's    from the theater.
         For    opening night. You
         say    the worst thing
         that    can happen. And

         it won't.   Break a leg.

Shane waves uncertainly and walks away.


EXT. McGINTY'S BACK YARD - DAY

The Judge (now with his jacket off) and
Wilkinson are lined up across from each other
in a three-point stance in something called a
man maker drill.

The entire team forms two lanes on either
side of them, as they face off.

The idea is to knock the other guy down and
get by him.

                 JUDGE
         Alright, this is how we
         used to stop a running
         back.

                 WILKINSON
         I can't wait.

Someone says hut! And Wilkinson slams into
the Republican 16th Circuit Court Judge and
knocks him head over heels.

The Judge lands on his back, wham!   He's out
cold.

Wilkinson slaps hands with Andre and Jamal.

                 WILKINSON
         Oooh... got me a judge!
         Man, that felt good!

  CUT TO:


EXT. BIG O STADIUM - DAY

It's another beautiful fall afternoon and
cars are entering the stadium parking lot.

At one of the entrances, the striking
Redskins are picketing. Jerome Lindell (NFL
Players President) is still marching with
them.

A little boy stops one of the Redskins and
asks for an autograph on a program. The

player gives it to him and the kid walks
away.

Lindell runs after the kid, grabs the program
and rips off the page the player signed.

                 LINDELL
                (to kid)
         Don't be asking    for no
         autographs from    the
         real players and    then
         go in and watch    the
         scabs!

The kid retreats quickly.    Lindell rips up
the page.

                 LINDELL
                (to the player)
         That is not the message
         we want to send our
         children!

  CUT TO:


INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

It's very quiet. Shane sits in pads and no
jersey, methodically squeezing a football.

Reese Evans, his center, stops by.

                 EVANS
         You okay?

Shane nods and gives a nauseous-looking
smile.

                 EVANS
         Remember to nod your
         head on the snap.

                 SHANE
                (out of it)
         Nod my head?

                    EVANS
         For    when Murray's in.
         The    deaf kid. Hello?
         He    needs to look at you
         on    the snap.

Shane nods that he understands but he goes

back to staring at a wall.

Andre and Jamal sit facing each other. Andre
throws a vicious forearm at Jamal's head but
Jamal catches it. They both nod in approval.

Lou Pacifico smokes and stares.

Bateman is leaning against a wall, fully
dressed, helmet on. He's staring into space
and smiling to himself. He looks terrifying.

Earl Wilkinson (the criminal) is polishing a
beautiful pair of new alligator shoes.

Clifford Franklin looks at himself in the
mirror as he ceremoniously puts on his
helmet.

Walter Cochran is reading his Bible in front
of his locker, which features a picture of
Jesus and a cross.

Mickey Lee (ex-sumo) is sitting in front of a
bowl of hard boiled eggs. He's methodically
popping them into his mouth. He eats four as
we watch.

Coach Pilachowski comes up to Lee and watches
him eat.

                 PILACHOWSKI
         What are you, crazy?
         Nobody eats right
         before a game.

                 LEE
         I always ate before a
         big match. I need the
         bulk.

Like a hole in the head he needs the bulk.

Coach McGinty comes strolling through the
locker room, the picture of calm.

He walks by defensive end/tight end Brian
Murray and signs to him to have a good game.
Murray signs back, "Thanks, Coach."

Cochran spots McGinty and puts down his
Bible.

                 COCHRAN

         Coach McGinty, I'd like
         to lead the team in the
         pregame prayer.

                 McGINTY
         No. No praying.
         That's the problem with
         professional sports
         today: too much god
         damn praying. Five
         hundred dollar fine to
         the first man I hear
         praying.

McGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey and
walks to the middle of the locker room.

He eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes
in his players.

                 McGINTY
         A lot of people are
         waiting for you to fall
         on your asses today.
         And guess what? You're
         going to. But I don't
         give a shit if you look
         funny out there. Or if
         you miss a block, or
         drop a pass, or trip
         over your own dick.
         This is professional.
         And the difference
         between professional
         and amateur, between
         playing for the
         Washington Redskins and
         Michigan State is
         simply... money. You
         are being paid to win.
         Not just to play. Not
         just to learn how to be
         good sports. Not for
         the alumni. You are
         being paid to win. I
         don't care how the fuck
         you do it. But I'm
         demanding it. Because
         those guys whose place
         you're taking have
         forgotten that simple
         fact. So, go win it.

He walks away.   The players get up and start

moving.

  CUT TO:


EXT. BIG O - DAY

We're FOCUSED ON an enormous,    plastic blow-up
Washington Redskin helmet that    bobs on the
ground in front of the exit to    the field.
The idea is, the players will    run into and
then out of the helmet as they    are
introduced.

Annabelle and her fellow twenty cheerleaders
are lined up on either side of the bobbing
helmet, waiting for the players.


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

They are in their booth, vamping ON CAMERA.

                  MADDEN
          ... Pretty bold move by
          New England Patriot
          owner Victor Kiam, who
          went out and bought an
          entire semi-pro team
          once the strike
          happened.
                  (MORE)

                  MADDEN (CONT'D)
          Redskin management, on
          the other hand, is
          going with a bunch of
          unknowns. Their public
          relations people don't
          even have bios yet on
          most of their players,
          although we'll see one
          or two familiar faces
          out there today.

                  SUMMERALL
          Like Shane Falco, the
          enormously talented
          college quarterback
          from Ohio State, who
          never fulfilled his
          potential in the pro's.
                 (to Madden)
          Wow, remember that

            Sugar Bowl Falco
            quarterbacked when
            Florida State creamed
            them?

                    MADDEN
            Oh, yeah, they were
            absolutely decimated!

                    SUMMERALL
            Dusted. And if I'm not
            mistaken, Falco set a
            record in that game for
            Bowl interceptions.
            Anyway, for some of
            these players this is
            another shot; a last
            shot, probably, for a
            guy like Falco...

  CUT TO:


INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Shane is looking out at the field through the
blow-up helmet. He looks scared.

Suddenly, a CANNON goes off with a stomach-
resounding BOOM! Shane jumps.

                    ANNOUNCER
            (V.O.)
            Ladies and gentlemen,
            your Washington
            Redskins!


IN STANDS

A sparse crowd is in attendance, mostly
diehard fans like Todd, Rod and Bob, who are
decked out in burgundy and gold. They look
drunk already as they cheer like mad.

                    ANNOUNCER
            (V.O.)
            Here's the starting
            defense today...


INT. TUNNEL

Bateman is first in line.    He looks like a

racehorse on cocaine.

                    ANNOUNCER
            (V.O.)
            At middle linebacker,
            number 56, Daniel
            Bateman!

Bateman takes off at a dead run out of the
tunnel and into the helmet.


ON HIS FOOT

It hits a wire stretched across the ground
inside the helmet.


ON BATEMAN

He trips big-time into the side of the
helmet. He bounces (it's inflated,
remember?) to the other side, bounces again
and is shot out of the front of it like a
cannon ball.


ON CHEERLEADERS

Bateman bounces out of the helmet and takes
out the first six cheerleaders.

Girls fly left and right.       One girl is
knocked out of her shoes.


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

Madden covers his face.     Summerall looks
pained.

                    SUMMERALL
            Oh, my...


IN STANDS

Even the hardcore Todd, Rob and Bob can
hardly look at the carnage.


OUTSIDE STANDS

A contingent of strike players like Eddie

Martel and Wilson Jones huddle in the parking
lot. They are laughing their asses off as
they watch on a personal TV.


ON FIELD

Cheerleaders are down and screaming in pain.
Annabelle is running from girl to girl, doing
triage.


ON BATEMAN

He's sheepishly standing to one side as
trainers come out to assist.


INT. BLOWUP HELMET

Jamal and Shane are examining the trip wire.
Obviously, they were sabotaged.

                    JAMAL
            Bastards.

                    ANNOUNCER
            (V.O.)
            And now... uh, the rest
            of the Washington
            Redskins.

The rest of the team walks unceremoniously
out of the helmet and onto the field.

  CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD - DAY

BOOM! The Patriot kicker puts one in the end
zone for a touchback.

The ball is placed on the twenty as Shane and
the offense walk out onto the field.

Shane walks slowly toward the huddle that's
forming.


IN HUDDLE

Andre and Mickey Lee are arguing.

                   ANDRE
           That's where I stand.

                   LEE
           No it's not.

                   ANDRE
           Come on, man, that's my
           spot in the huddle.


ON SHANE

As he walks, we hear McGinty's voice in
Shane's helmet. Yes, they do it by one-way
helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear
is McGinty, speaking into his headset mike.

                   McGINTY (V.O.)
           All right, son, nice
           and easy now. Let's
           run our ten planned
           plays, get a feel for
           the land...

Shane walks into the huddle and chaos.

                   ANDRE
           ... Fat fucking nip!
           You don't know shit!

                   LEE
           What did you call me?!

                   ANDRE
           You heard me, you tub a
           rice shit!

                   SHANE
           Hold on, what's the
           problem here?

Andre and Lee ignore Shane and start pushing
each other.

                   LEE
           I'm gonna kick your
           black ass...

                   ANDRE
           You ain't kickin' jack
           shit...

Now Jamal gets involved as Shane tries to get

between them.

                    JAMAL
                   (to Lee)
            Don't be messing with
            my brother...

                    SHANE
            Hey, hold on...


ON REF

He's watching the play clock and when it gets
to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws
it.

                    REF
            Delay of game!    Five
            yards!


IN HUDDLE

Lee suddenly punches Andre through his face
guard. Andre knocks into Shane and spins him
around. Jamal then goes to punch Lee, he
misses and nails Shane in the back of the
helmet.

Shane goes down hard.


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

They look confused.

                    SUMMERALL
            ... I don't know.
            Something seems to be
            going on in the huddle.
            It looks like... yes,
            Shane Falco is on his
            back. They haven't run
            a play yet but Falco is
            down.

                    MADDEN
            This is not a good
            sign.


ON FIELD

Trainers race out to Shane, who is lying face
up with the huddle standing over him.

                 SHANE
                (clearing the
         cobwebs)
         What happened? Am I
         hurt already?

Shane sits up.   Suddenly, he remembers what
happened.

                 SHANE
         God damn it! I am the
         quarterback! I am the
         only one supposed to
         talk in the huddle!

                 ANDRE
         Yeah, but he took my
         place...

                 SHANE
         I don't give a shit!

Shane gets to his feet.

                 SHANE
         Huddle up!

Everybody leans in.

                 SHANE
         If you've got something
         to say, raise your
         hand! Is that
         understood?!

Lee raises his hand.   Shane grits his teeth
and nods.

                 LEE
         Suppose like, you don't
         feel good. Or you're
         hurt or something like
         that. Then what?

                 SHANE
         Then you tell me before
         the huddle starts!
         Okay, listen up: 68
         blue east storm toss.
         On two.

Jamal raises his hand.

                     SHANE
            What?!

                    JAMAL
            That's to the right...
            right?

                    ANDRE
            No, it's to the left.

                    SHANE
            It's to the right!

                    JAMAL
            You better be quiet,
            Shane, they'll hear
            you.

We do hear a WHISTLE.        A penalty flag flies
by.

                    REF
            Delay of game!     Five
            yards!

Shane throws ups his hands.


ON McGINTY

He's talking into his mike.

                    McGINTY
            What the hell is going
            on?


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL


                   MADDEN
            Well, Pat, so far the
            Redskins have minus ten
            yards offensively.


ON O'NEIL

He's in bed sucking oxygen watching the game.
Augustine sits with him.

                     O'NEIL

            Turn it off. This is
            going to kill me.


ON REDSKIN HUDDLE

It breaks this time and everyone runs to the
line of scrimmage.

                    SHANE
            Blue 68. Blue 68!
            Hut! Hut!

On the snap, Shane turns to head off to
Lamont but instead runs right into Jamal who
knocks him down.

Shane looks up at Jamal.

                    SHANE
            Have you suddenly
            decided you don't like
            me, Jamal?

                    JAMAL
            Oh. You said it was to
            the right, didn't you?


IN HUDDLE

Shane leans in.

                    SHANE
            Okay. Let's try
            something simple. 18
            red left slot open.
                   (to Jamal)
            That's to the left!

They break and Shane lines up over his
center.

                    SHANE
            Eighteen red! Eighteen
            red! Hut! Hut!

On the snap, Shane hands to Lamont who sweeps
left, cuts inside and picks up eight yards.

Shane is ecstatic.

                    SHANE
            Yeah!

And then a penalty flag flies by.

                 REF
         Holding! Number 78.

Shane looks at Jamal who is trying
desperately to hide his number.

Shane leans in with the next play. Cochran,
playing right tackle, can't resist.

                 COCHRAN
         You see. We should
         have prayed.

                 SHANE
         Shut up! Pass. 22
         Solo right slot 'A,' Y
         stick. On one.

They break and come to the line of scrimmage.

                 SHANE
         Twenty-two green.    Hut!

Shane does a play action fake to Lamont and
then turns downfield.

Wham! He's buried by three defenders. The
ball squirts loose and the Patriots recover.


ON PILACHOWSKI

He's livid on the sidelines. As his
offensive line comes off he rants at them.

Shane hobbles off past:

The defense rushing onto the field led by
Bateman.

                 SUMMERALL
         (V.O.)
         Washington comes up a
         minus fourteen yards on
         their first possession.


ON PATRIOTS

They break their huddle and come to the line
of scrimmage. Bateman is snorting fire.

Earl Wilkinson (with SMITH on the back of his
jersey) patrols the secondary and calls out
the formation.

                  EARL
          Wide right! You got
          wide right! Check on
          the wing!

The PATRIOT QUARTERBACK sets up over center.

                  PATRIOT QB
          Blue fourteen!

Bam! Bateman runs offside and flattens the
quarterback. Penalty flags fly everywhere.


ON SIDELINE

Defensive Coordinator Banes rolls his eyes.

The Ref moves the ball five yards and gives
the offside sign.


ON PATRIOTS

They come out of the huddle again.

                  PATRIOT QB
          Green eighty-seven!

Pow! Bateman dives offside again and
forearms the Quarterback, knocking him on his
back. Flags fly again.

One Patriot lineman makes the mistake of
pushing Bateman. Bateman literally jumps on
his head. More flags fly.


ON SIDELINE

Banes is screaming something unintelligible
at Bateman.


ON BALL

It's marched downfield by the Ref, this time
fifteen yards.

OVER this we hear:

                      SUMMERALL
              (V.O.)
              I think the Redskins
              just set a record for
              penalties in the first
              three minutes. We're
              waiting for the stats
              on that...

Here come the Patriots again.

     CUT TO:


FIRST HALF MONTAGE

A)    SHANE

      rolls to his right but the blitz    is on
      and he reverses and rolls left.     He's
      finally cornered and has to dump    the ball
      off. The pass is incomplete and     he's
      knocked on his ass.

B)    SHANE

      fakes to Lamont and rolls again.     He
      fires a bullet to Franklin on a    down and
      out. Clifford actually catches     the ball,
      then bobbles it and in trying to    get
      possession again, hands the ball    to the
      defender.

      The defender can't believe it for a beat
      and then he streaks down the sideline and
      scores.

C)    McGINTY

      just shakes his head.

D)    TODD, ROB AND BOB

      scream in pain. Rod pours his own beer
      over his own head.

E)    O'NEIL

      looks disgusted as he watches with
      Augustine.

F)    BATEMAN

     grabs the opposing running backs' face
     mask and spins him around and around.
     Flags fly everywhere.

G)   SHANE

     is on the run again looking for a
     receiver. He finally throws the ball...
     right into the hands of the opposing
     safety.

     Shane dives for the guy and misses.   The
     safety scores.

H)   ANNABELLE

     is trying desperately to get the crowd
     into the game by jumping up and down and
     waving her pom poms.

     Five guys right in front of her get up
     from their seats, take all their stuff
     and leave.

        CUT TO:


EXT. GAME - ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD - SECOND QUARTER

shows the Patriots up 17 to 0.


ON SHANE

He's rolling in the back field again looking
for a receiver.


SHANE'S POV

Nothing but meat coming at him.


BACK TO SCENE

Shane panics and tosses the ball out of
bounds. Shane looks at McGinty on the
sidelines. We hear McGinty's voice.

                     McGINTY (V.O.)
             You had Lamont open in
             the flat.

Shane puts his head down like he knows it.

                    McGINTY (V.O.)
            Come on, now, son.
            Pick up your pace on
            the roll. See the big
            picture. Pump and
            fake, pump and fake.


IN HUDDLE

Everyone is dirty, sweating bullets and
breathing very hard.

Shane leans into the huddle.

Lee is raising his hand.

                    SHANE
            What?

                    LEE
            I don't feel good.

And with that he promptly vomits sixteen
eggs.

                    ANDRE
            Oh, God!

                    COCHRAN
            Oooooh...

                    JAMAL
            Man, that's ripe!

Everyone is reacting.       Some players gag.

                    EVANS
            Shane, we got to move!

                   SHANE
            Okay. On the count of
            three. Everyone more
            left. Hut! Hut! Hut!


ON HUDDLE

Eleven bentover guys move in unison with tiny
steps to their left.

ON PATRIOTS' LINEBACKER

The guy watches the huddle moving.

                    PATRIOT LB
            What the fuck is this?


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

Summerall has his binoculars on the moving
huddle.

                    SUMMERALL
            John, how many years
            have we been calling
            games together?

                    MADDEN
            Seventeen, I think.

Pat just hands John the binoculars.


IN HUDDLE

Shane calls the play as they continue to move
as one.

                    SHANE
            U brown right, west 19
            A lead. That's you,
            Mickey. Puke on him if
            you have to.


ON HUDDLE

The huddle stops and they break for the line
of scrimmage.


ON LEE

He lines up face to face with the Patriots'
defensive end.

Lee breathes in the guy's face and the
Patriot gags.

                   SHANE (O.S.)
            Hut!

Lee runs right over the guy.       He's quickly

followed by Lamont with the ball.

Lamont runs for eighteen yards and a first
down.


ON PATRIOT DEFENSIVE END

He's waving for a substitute as he weaves off
the field.

                 MADDEN (V.O.)
         Very nice off tackle
         run by Lamont.
         Execution was letter
         perfect.

                 SUMMERALL
         (V.O.)
         That puts the Redskins
         in field goal range.
         And here comes Pacifico
         to see if he can get
         them on the board
         before the half ends.


ON PACIFICO

He flicks his smoke away as he runs out onto
the field.


INT. BAR (QUEENS, NEW YORK)

A guy sitting at the bar turns his head
quickly to the televised game when he hears
Pacifico's name.

This is the same mafioso type who saw Lou
kick the ball that knocked the godfather's
hat off. Remember?


EXT. BIG O - ON SHANE - DAY

He crouches down and waits for the snap from
Evans.

Pacifico lines himself up.

                 MADDEN (V.O.)
         This will be a forty-
         five yarder. That's a

         tough distance for your
         first N.F.L. field goal
         try.

                  SHANE
         Hut!

It's a perfect snap.   Shane spots it,
Pacifico belts it.

And it goes through for three.


ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They begin immediately singing "Hail to the
Redskins," a march always sung after a score.
They and the sparse crowd in the stadium know
and sing every word.


ON PACIFICO

He gets high fives all around. Then Bateman
runs up and in his ecstasy, slaps Pacifico in
the head.

Pacifico goes down, knocked out cold.


ON CHEERLEADERS

Led by Annabelle, the girls are doing a
stirring finale to "Hail to the Redskins."

  CUT TO:


INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY (HALF-TIME)

Everyone is lying on the floor.

Shane has ice bags on his head, shoulder,
elbow and both knees.

Pacifico is getting smelling salts from a
trainer as Bateman hovers nearby waiting to
apologize.

Mickey Lee is chewing ice.

Cochran is reading his Bible.

McGinty walks in and bends down to Shane.

                 McGINTY
                (quietly)
         You got to look for
         Murray over the middle.
         You got to trust me on
         this: he's a big,
         tough kid with good
         hands.

                 SHANE
         We can't put three
         plays together without
         a penalty, a fumble of
         a fight.

                 McGINTY
         You still got a whole
         half left. You're a
         thoroughbred out there
         running against a bunch
         a nags. You can pick
         these fuckers apart.

Shane smiles through his pain.

                 SHANE
         You're good. You're
         really good.

  CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD - DAY

The Patriots have the ball. Their
Quarterback drops back for a pass and throws
it.


ON WILKINSON

Earl is covering the intended receiver. He
deftly steps in front of the guy, and makes a
diving catch.


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

                 SUMMERALL
         Another terrific
         interception by Smith.
         That's his second.

Madden starts shuffling through pages.

                 MADDEN
         Yeah, this guy is a
         player.

He finds the paper he's looking for.

                 MADDEN
         According to the
         Redskins, Ray Smith...
         is... that's weird. No
         college given, no high
         school given. It just
         says he's been a
         resident of the state
         of Maryland for the
         last four years and
         five months. Likes to
         embroider.

  CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD - DAY

Shane is walking toward the huddle.     In his
ear, he hears:

                 McGINTY (V.O)
         Half your job is
         getting that huddle in
         the right mindset. Use
         your imagination,
         Shane.

Shane stops short of the huddle.     Everyone is
looking at him.

There is a beat and then Shane steps in.

                 SHANE
         Okay, let's all take a
         few seconds to think
         about what we were
         doing for a living...
         just last week.

Shane looks around the huddle.     Everybody
looks pained and/or depressed.

                 SHANE
         Good. Let's kick ass.
         Red right pass 15 x

             hook.

They break the huddle and Shane sets up over
Evans. He glances over at Brian Murray.

Murray is lined up in a three point stance at
tight end. But his head is turned and he's
looking directly at Shane.

                     SHANE
             Red fifteen! Red
             fifteen! Hut!

Shane nods on the snap.

The front five, in the persons of Andre,
Jamal, Reese, Mickey Lee and Cochran, hit out
and simultaneously knock their men on their
backs.

Shane, with plenty of time, hits Murray over
the middle for twelve yards.

Shane looks over at the sidelines.   McGinty
is smiling.


MONTAGE

A)   SHANE

     is under pressure but he rolls smoothly
     and rockets the ball downfield.

Murray pulls it in for fifteen yards.

B)   SHANE

     rolls left off the shotgun, fights off a
     cornerback and throws back across field,
     complete to Lamont coming out of the
     backfield.

C)   PATRIOT

     is calling for a fair catch on a punt.
     He catches the ball but Bateman flies
     INTO FRAME and decks him. Flags fly.

D)   ANDRE AND JAMAL

     are blocking side by side, pushing their
     men back as Lamont squeezes through with
     the ball.

E)   EVANS

     is pass blocking like the all pro that he
     is. He knocks his man flat and then
     doubles up on Cochran's man.

F)   BATEMAN

     is pursuing a running back.   He knocks
     down an official and runs right over him.
     Then he gets his hands on the running
     back and pushes him out of bounds and
     then knocks over a photographer.

G)   SHANE

     pumps once and then drills a twenty yard
     spiral.

     Clifford Franklin beats his man and dives
     for the ball. He bobbles it, and then
     squeezes it to his stomach as he hits the
     ground.

        CUT TO:


INT. BOOTH - DAY

Madden uses his pen on the screen to try to
explain a play. There are already lines
everywhere.

                     MADDEN (V.O.)
             ... began with a
             Redskin end around, but
             Cochran, the pulling
             tackle ran into Falco's
             pitchout ... see?
                     (MORE)

                           MADDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
             Right here, it bounced
             off his helmet. Then
             it was kicked by Landon
             and then Hayes touched
             it, I think, and then
             Green got a hand on it,
             and then Bellinski
             recovered it and then
             he lost it, and finally
             the ball took a crazy
             bounce right back into

            Falco's hands, look at
            his face here. He's as
            surprised as anybody!
            Falco then ran it back
            to just about the
            original line of
            scrimmage, executed the
            same play -- an end
            around to Murray -- and
            the Skins score.
            Welcome to Strike
            Football!


ON PACIFICO

Boom!   He boots the extra point.

Scoreboard:    Patriots 17, Redskins 10.

  DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

We're on the clock which shows one minute ten
seconds left in the fourth quarter.


ON HUDDLE

It breaks and comes to the line of scrimmage.
Shane drops into the shotgun.

                    SHANE
            Hut, hut!

Shane rolls left but there's a blitz! The
cornerback is almost on him when Shane shifts
and rolls the other way.


ON FRANKLIN

He's wide open five yards from the goal line.


ON SHANE

They're breathing down his back.


SHANE'S POV

He sees Franklin and cocks his arm.
Suddenly, opposing jerseys are everywhere.

Shane dumps the ball. He's immediately
decked by a defensive end.


ON BALL

We watch the flight of it in SLOW MOTION. We
FOLLOW it right INTO the hands of... a New
England Patriot defensive back.


ON SHANE

He's down and not moving.


ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They scream in despair.


ON ANNABELLE

She falls to her knees in pain.

                   SUMMERALL
           (V.O.)
           Falco is intercepted.
           That's too bad.

                   MADDEN (V.O.)
           Yeah, and it looks like
           he's hurt, too. He was
           really starting to put
           it together here in the
           fourth quarter. Only
           forty-eight seconds now
           left on the clock.


ON SHANE

He's helped off the field and onto the bench.


ON McGINTY

He grabs Bateman before he can run out onto
the field.

                  McGINTY

           Danny.
                  (very slowly)
           Get me the ball.

                   BATEMAN
           The ball. Okay, Coach.

He runs out onto the field.


ON PATRIOTS

They line up.

                   PATRIOT QB
           Hut, hut, hut!

The quarterback hands off to the running back
right up the middle in a typical "run out the
clock" play.

BAM! Bateman comes out of nowhere, decks the
runner and literally rips the ball out of his
hands as he goes down.


ON CROWD

They go wild!


ON ANNABELLE

She does a cartwheel.


ON McGINTY

He's leaning over a groggy Shane on the
bench.

                   McGINTY
           Don't shake your head
           at me. You are going
           back in there. You are
           gonna run the same god
           damn play, you are
           gonna throw the ball to
           Franklin again and this
           time, he's gonna score.

                   SHANE
           I can't...

McGinty grabs some smelling salts from a
hovering trainer.

He shoves them under Shane's nose.    Shane is
suddenly very awake.

                    McGINTY
            You are the only one in
            this entire stadium who
            can do it. Do you
            understand me? You can
            do something no one
            else can do. So, start
            right here. Start
            living your destiny.
            Or give it up for good.
            Right here. Right now.

Shane stares at him.

Then he stands up, wobbles and puts on his
helmet.


ON HUDDLE

They're all turned and watching as Shane
makes his way slowly out onto the field.

Annabelle watches him closely.

                    SUMMERALL
            (V.O.)
            Here comes Falco with
            eighteen seconds left
            on the clock.

                    MADDEN (V.O.)
            I'm surprised to see
            him again after that
            shot he took from
            Bellinski.


ON HUDDLE

It breaks and Shane stands over Evans and
looks out at the defense.

Nasty-looking linebackers and cornerbacks
stare at him.

                    SHANE
            22 green!

His voice cracks and several defensive
players openly laugh at him.

Shane gets an idea.

                    SHANE
            Check! Black 43!
            Black 43!


ON ANDRE

He's down in a three-point stance facing a
defender. He whispers to Reese:

                    ANDRE
            What's that mean?

                   REESE
                  (whispering
            back)
            He's changing the play.
            Listen!

                    SHANE
            Black 43!

                    MADDEN (V.O.)
            It's a long count.
            Falco could be calling
            an audible.


ON LAMONT

He shifts position in the backfield.

                    LAMONT
                   (to Shane)
            Is this right?

                   SHANE
                  (shaking his
            head)
            Black 43 left!

Lamont shifts again. Clifford goes in motion
from his flanker position but then changes
his mind and goes back the other way.

Lamont and Clifford then bump into each
other.

ON PATRIOT DEFENSE

They are totally confused now as they try to
adjust to the equally confused Redskins.


ON McGINTY

He looks extremely pissed.


ON SHANE

                    SHANE
           Hut!   Hut!

He turns to hand the ball off to Lamont but
Lamont is not there.

Shane turns the other way and sees Lamont
just standing there looking at him. Shane
runs over to him and hands him the ball.

Meanwhile, the Patriot defense is going the
other direction.

Lamont takes off.

One cornerback is not taken in. The guy
dives for Lamont's legs. We hear a CLANK as
the cornerback's HELMET hits Lamont's
industrial KNEE BRACE. The guy bounces off
and Lamont trots into the end zone.

                   SUMMERALL
           (V.O.)
           Lamont scores!

                   MADDEN (V.O.)
           Whoa! Falco calls an
           audible at the line of
           scrimmage and Lamont
           takes it in!

Shane, meanwhile, is looking at McGinty on
the sidelines.

                   McGINTY (V.O.)
                  (in Shane's
           helmet)
           I guess you saw
           something I didn't.

Shane nods vigorously.

                    McGINTY (V.O.)
            Don't try to bullshit
            me, pal. You didn't
            want it. Winners
            always want the ball
            with the game on the
            line. You know that.

Shane looks down.

                    McGINTY (V.O.)
            Alright. The play
            is... waggle right,
            drag hook. You
            understand?

Shane nods.


ON O'NEIL

He looks ten years younger as he and
Augustine watch.

                    SUMMERALL
            (V.O.)
            With eight seconds
            remaining, Pacifico
            will try the extra
            point that will send
            this game into
            overtime.

                    MADDEN (V.O.)
            This turned out to be
            one hell of a contest,
            Pat!


ON PACIFICO

He sets up for the kick.


ON SHANE

He waits for the snap.


ON BRIAN MURRAY

He sets up at his flanker position.

                   SHANE
            Hut!

Shane catches the snap and pitches the ball
out to Murray from his holding position.

                    MADDEN (V.O.)
            It's a fake!

The Patriot right defensive end breaks
through and reaches for Murray. The only
person in his way is Shane, still kneeling in
the holding position. Shane screams as the
huge lineman trips over him and then falls on
him.

Murray sweeps around the right side and
scores untouched.

Redskins win.

Everybody goes nuts.


ON O'NEIL

He pounds on Augustine.


ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They pound on each other.     Hail to the
Redskins is deafening.


ON McGINTY

He just smiles.


ON SHANE

He's still under the defensive end. Reese
Evans pulls the guy off and bends down to
Shane.

                    REESE
            We won, Shane.   We won!

Shane manages a painful smile.

  DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WASHINGTON HILTON - BAR - NIGHT

It's packed with players, friends and
assorted groupies.

Pacifico is smoking and talking non-stop to a
group who hang on his every word.

Andre is already passed out at a booth.
Jamal supports one side of Andre so he
doesn't fall over.

Murray is signing to several fans who sign
back.

Clifford Franklin signs autographs.

Earl Wilkinson, dressed to the nines, is
dancing close and slow with a gorgeous woman.

Shane is at the bar and he's not in good
shape. He's got cuts and bruises visible and
every time he moves he grimaces. The
martinis are starting to help, however.

He's talking to a stunning WOMAN IN RED.

                 SHANE
         ... ultimately, it's a
         pain thing, you know?
         I mean, it's Darwinian,
         the survival of the
         numbest. Whoever can
         take the pain most,
         gets the largest
         contract. It's sick.

He finishes his martini and throws the olive
over his shoulder.

                         WOMAN
         IN RED
         Exactly. Let me buy
         you another.

She signals to the bartender.

                 WOMAN IN RED
         I don't know how you do
         it. I hate pain. Pain
         is a no no as far as
         I'm concerned.

Shane gets his new drink, takes a sip and
visibly slumps at the bar.

                           SHANE
                (slurring)
         I'm glad that you are
         concerned.

                 WOMAN    IN RED
         Hey, are you    alright?
         I'll take you    up to
         your room, if    you like.

Shane looks at her closely.

                 SHANE
         I would like.

  CUT TO::


INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Shane weaves down the hallway with the Woman
In Red.


They stop at a door.

                 SHANE
         Here's home.

Shane fumbles for a key.

Another stunning-looking woman suddenly
appears from down the hall. This is the
WOMAN IN BLUE.

                 WOMAN IN RED
         A friend of mine is
         going to join us, okay?

                  WOMAN IN BLUE
         Hi.   Ready to party?

She checks the hallway, takes the key from
Shane and sticks it in the lock.

                 SHANE
                (looking at both
                 women)
         Oooooh. Bookends.

                 WOMAN IN BLUE

         And you're the book,
         baby.

Suddenly, Annabelle Farrell appears in the
hallway.

                 ANNABELLE
                (to the girls)
         Go away. Both of you.

                 WOMAN IN RED
         Fuck off!

Crack! Annabelle punches her in the nose
with a straight right hand. The girl bounces
off the wall.

                 SHANE
                (to Annabelle)
         These are my guests.

                 WOMAN IN RED
                (now bleeding)
         You crazy bitch!

Both girls take off.

                 SHANE
         Why did you do that?

Annabelle opens the door.

                 ANNABELLE
         You were about to be
         rolled.

                 SHANE
                (as he enters)
         That's what I was
         hoping.


INT. ROOM - NIGHT

Annabelle is pulling the bed down as Shane
falls into a chair.

                 ANNABELLE
         They work the bar
         downstairs looking for
         drunk Redskins.

Shane looks embarrassed.

                 SHANE
         I guess they found one.

                 ANNABELLE
         Don't feel so bad.
         It's a rookie mistake.

She turns and sees that he's already passed
out.

She looks at him not unkindly. Then she
unbuckles his belt and starts pulling his
pants off.

  DISSOLVE TO:


INT. ROOM - CLOSE ON SHANE'S BEAT UP FACE - DAWN

as he opens his eyes.

He rolls over and screams in pain.


ON ANNABELLE

She's wearing nothing but a Redskins' T-
shirt. She quickly bends over him.

                  ANNABELLE
         Here.   Take this.

                 SHANE
                (groaning)
         What is it?

                 ANNABELLE
         It's for the pain.
         Take it. It's only a
         little bit illegal.

Shane takes it and swigs a glass of water.

                 SHANE
         Oh, God. I've got to
         go to the bathroom.
         It's far away, isn't
         it?

                 ANNABELLE
         I'll help. We'll just
         take our time.

She helps him get out of bed.   When he

stands, he screams again.

                 ANNABELLE
         Kidneys.

                 SHANE
         Oh, man. My hair
         hurts.

                 ANNABELLE
         You took a hell of a
         beating. The martinis
         didn't help, either.

She walks him to the bathroom like an old
man. He shuffles in and closes the door.

                 ANNABELLE
         Don't be afraid if
         you've got blood in
         your urine. That's
         normal.

                 SHANE (O.S.)
         Did you undress me?

                 ANNABELLE
         Yes.

                 SHANE (O.S.)
         And you... slept here
         with me?

                 ANNABELLE
         Yes.

                 SHANE (O.S.)
         Did we... ?

                 ANNABELLE
         Are you kidding? You
         were catatonic.

He appears again at the door.

                 SHANE
         No blood.

                  ANNABELLE
         Good.   Back to bed.

He leans on her as she walks him back.

He gets into bed with a moan.

                    SHANE
            May I ask you a
            personal question?

She nods.

                    SHANE
            Do you do this for all
            Redskin quarterbacks?

                    ANNABELLE
            Of course not.

                    SHANE
            Then why me?

Annabelle takes her time answering.

                    ANNABELLE
            I don't know. I guess
            I can't resist a man
            who can take a hit.

                    SHANE
            I can't take a hit!

Annabelle cradles his head.

                   ANNABELLE
            Shhh. It's all in your
            head. Now, get some
            sleep.

  CUT TO:


INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

Annabelle walks up to Shane's door with a
stack of newspapers. She enters.


INT. ROOM - DAY

The bathroom door is closed.      Annabelle talks
to him anyway.

                    ANNABELLE
            You're the golden boy
            in the press this
            morning.

She reads a headline.

                 ANNABELLE
         'Falco scores big.'
                (to herself)
         Well... not really.
                (still reading)
         Hey, a lot of the
         regular players are
         starting to cross the
         picket line.

                 SHANE (O.S.)
         Redskins?

                 ANNABELLE
         It doesn't say.

Shane comes out of the bathroom dressed and
ready to go. He's still moving slowly and in
great pain.

                 ANNABELLE
         Where are you going?

                 SHANE
         McGinty called a dinner
         meeting with the whole
         team.

Shane tries to put on his coat, but he's so
sore he can't. Annabelle helps him.

                 SHANE
         Thank you. Thanks
         for... everything.     You
         saved my life.

                 ANNABELLE
         No. Probably just your
         wallet and your watch.

                 SHANE
         And that pill, that
         sure worked.

                 ANNABELLE
         You're basic double D
         Vicodin. But be
         careful: It's habit-
         forming. The best
         stuff always is.

There's another awkward silence.

                      SHANE
           Well...

                   ANNABELLE
           Ice both knees and that
           shoulder before bed.

Clifford, still carrying his football, comes
out of his apartment in a third floor walk-
up. He's wearing his Redskins jacket.

As he turns around from locking his door, he
stops dead in his tracks.

All of Clifford's neighbors, all the way down
both halls, are standing in front of their
doors.

They all start applauding.

Clifford smiles from ear to ear.


MONTAGE

A)    ANDRE AND JAMAL

      are trying to hail a cab on Wisconsin
      Avenue. Suddenly, one cab, then two,
      then four SLAM on their BRAKES.

    Cabbies hop out to open their doors for
the brothers.

B)    ROLAND LAMONT

      walks down G Street with Brian Murray.
      Brian spots something in a store window
      and stops Roland.

      Roland gasps as he sees himself
      duplicated on ten TV screens in an
      appliance store. He's on tape being
      interviewed at a Redskins' practice.

C)    EARL WILKINSON

      dressed in casual chic, is moving quickly
      through Lord and Taylor's Department

      Store    with two sales clerks in tow. He

      smells    them, hands them to one clerk and
      moves    on.

D)    LOU PACIFICO

      is standing in front of the White House.

We see Shane walk in the door.


INT. PALM - NIGHT

The Scabskins are all being served dinner in
a private room.

Mickey Lee is served a steak the size of a
briefcase. Andre and Jamal get lobsters big
enough to be pets.

Ed O'Neil is being fed pureed asparagus by
Augustine. When Augustine drops the napkin
and bends over, O'Neil whispers urgently to
Cochran who is enjoying a steak:

                   O'NEIL
           I'll give you 50
           thousand dollars for a
           bite of that steak!

McGinty taps his glass at the head of the
table and stands.

                   McGINTY
           Alright, listen up:
           There have been a lot
           of rumors about the
           regular players
           crossing the picket
           lines. They are not
           rumors. Many union
           players have now seen
           the error of their ways
           and are coming back in

         droves. Apparently,
         they have been struck
         with the realization
         that it is a blessing
         to be playing
         professional football.

There is dead silence in the room.   Everybody
thinks it's over.

                 McGINTY
         But they had their
         chance. Now it's your
         turn. Mister O'Neil
         and I have agreed to
         ban all striking
         players and to continue
         to go with you guys.

There's a beat and then everyone breaks into
cheers.

Suddenly, the door flies open and a REPORTER
and a cameraman step in and start filming.
The Reporter shoves a microphone at McGinty.

                 REPORTER
         Coach, what will be
         your strategy against
         New York this Sunday?

Out in the restaurant, patrons see the
players and a few break into "Hail to the
Redskins."

Suddenly, the whole restaurant starts
singing.

Shane looks embarrassed.

Pacifico stands up on his seat, and conducts
the singing.

Andre and Jamal hold their lobsters in the
air and make them dance to the song.

         Hi.    Come in.

                  ANNABELLE
         No.

She gives him a bottle of pills.

                 ANNABELLE
         We don't travel with
         the team. So, here's
         Tylenol with codeine,
         regular Vicodins, the
         magic bullet one that I
         gave you before, and a
         couple of Darvons if
         you actually break
         something. Pop 'em in
         the ambulance.

                   SHANE
         Wow.    Thanks.

                 ANNABELLE
         I'll be watching on TV.
         The Giants got back
         three of their four

         Yeah.   I know.

                 ANNABELLE
         What can I say? Go
         from the shotgun and
         scramble your ass off.

Shane smiles at her.

She suddenly grabs him and they kiss big-

Then she breaks and walks quickly away.

Shane doesn't know what to make of this.

Shane is not even looking for a receiver.
He's looking to save his life.

Finally, he's caught by a six-foot-five, two
hundred and seventy pound defensive end named
HANK MORRIS, who throws him down and lands on
top of him. Oooof!

            turned out to be an
            incredible defensive
            duel.


EXT. STADIUM - DAY

Jerome Lindell is once again outside the
stadium, picketing with a smaller group of
players.

He does his interview on camera, standing in
front of a huge semi-truck.

And a big, overweight truck driver stands
next to him.

                    LINDELL
            ... because it's about
            brothers, and
            brotherhood and
            standing together
            against the oppressors.
            That's why I am so
            grateful to our
            Teamster brothers who
            have joined us here
            today in New York to
            protest the greed squad
            known as the N.F.L.
            owners.

The truck driver suddenly pumps his arm and a
CACOPHONY OF TRUCK AIR HORNS GO OFF.

It's deafening but Lindell smiles through it
all.


EXT. FIELD - DAY

Shane is rolling out with Morris on his heels
again. He can't find anyone open and runs
out of bounds.


IN HUDDLE

Everybody is breathing hard, beat-up and
exhausted. Shane leans in.

                   SHANE
                  (to Reese Evans)
           You got to double up on
           Morris.

                   EVANS
           He's too far outside
           for me to get to him.
                  (to Cochran)
           Bring him down and sit
           on him.

                   COCHRAN
           He's huge! He's been
           beating the crap out of
           me all day! I feel
           like a rag doll out
           here.

                   LEE
           I'll help this time.

                   SHANE
           Okay. Spread left 'A'
           Right, roll right Half
           Back Sail. On two.

They break.   Shane sets up in the shotgun.

                   SHANE
           Red, fifteen.   Hut,
           hut!

On the snap, Lee and Cochran double-team
Morris.

Morris slaps Cochran away like, well, a rag
doll, and then confronts the Sumo master.

He bumps stomachs with Lee. Lee flies
through the air and lands on his ass.


ON SHANE

He spots his receiver, he cocks his arm and
wham! Morris decks him. And, of course,
lands on him. Oooof!

                  MORRIS

                (to Shane)
         It's just me, fuck-
         face!

In order to get up, Morris puts one huge hand
on Shane's helmet and pushes himself up.
Shane moans as his face guard digs a four-
inch hole in the turf.


ON McGINTY

He's talking into his mike.

                 McGINTY
         You want a time-out?
         That looks like it
         hurt.

Shane gets up. He's got a huge piece of turf
stuck in his face guard so that for a beat,
we can't even see him.

Then he pulls out the dirt and grass, and we
see Shane really pissed off for the first
time.

                 SHANE
         Huddle up!

Everyone gathers around.

                 SHANE
         Same thing... Except...
                (to Lee and
                 Cochran)
         Let him in. Don't
         touch him.

                 LEE
         What?

                 EVANS
         Shane...

                 SHANE
         Shut up! Let him
         through. On two.

They break the huddle.     Shane goes into a
shotgun.

                 SHANE
         Red fifteen. Hut!

         Hut!

Shane does a three-step drop from the
shotgun.

Cochran and Lee hit out on either side of
Morris, giving him a clear shot at Shane.

Morris comes hard and fast.

Shane looks downfield, winds up, turns and
fires the ball at Morris's head.

The ball goes like a bullet for five feet and
then sticks like a dart in Morris's face
guard.

For a moment, Morris is blinded.

And Shane is dumbfounded.

Then Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of
his mask.

                 SHANE
         Get him!

Andre and Jamal grab onto Morris who starts
stumbling down field with the ball still
stuck in his helmet.

                 MADDEN (V.O.)
         Morris intercepts!
         Wait! The ball is
         stuck in his face!

But Morris won't go down. He's still trying
to pry the ball loose as he throws off Jamal.

Then he shakes off Andre.


ON BRIAN MURRAY

He's in SLOW MOTION in midair, diving towards
Morris.


MURRAY'S POV

It's absolutely QUIET (he's deaf, remember?)
as he soars towards Morris's head, helmet and
ball.

Wham! Murray's full body weight hits Morris
in the helmet, which flies off and rolls
across the field with the ball still stuck in
it.

OUT OF THE SILENCE, we suddenly hear the hit
and the crowd roar.

Morris goes down like a building with Murray
buried in his throat.


ON ROOM (D.C.)

Todd, Rod and Bob are destroying Todd's den
in reaction to the hit.


ON ANOTHER LIVING ROOM

Annabelle is screaming "Whoa!" to that hit.


ON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE

They're watching ON TV.

                 O'NEIL
         Now that's a hit!


ON BALL AND HELMET

It's in the very chubby hands of Mickey Lee,
who is rumbling downfield with the
fumble/helmet recovery.

New York players have been slow to pick this
up because they, too, have been admiring the
lick that Murray put on Morris.

Suddenly, the whole team is chasing Lee.

They catch him pretty easily at the twenty,
but Lee represents a lot of weight.

Lee staggers across the ten, shaking players
off left and right.

One defensive halfback sacrifices himself and
throws himself at Lee's feet.

Lee trips over the guy, gains his footing
again, walks on the guy (who screams in

agony) and falls into the end zone carrying
three players with him.


ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL

John is beside himself.

                    MADDEN
            Lee scores! Lee
            scores! Lee scores! I
            love to see a fat guy
            score!


ON LEE

He gets up in jubilation, spikes the
ball/helmet combination, and runs through the
back of the end zone.

But he doesn't stop. He's aiming for a low
wall that separates the first row of fans
from the field.


ON FOUR FANS

They see Mickey rumbling at them and they all
get the picture at the same time. They
scream!


ON MICKEY

He launches himself into the stands in
ecstasy.


ON FOUR FANS

Crunch!     Lee lands on all four of them.


ON FOOTBALL

It's hiked into Shane's hands and Pacifico
boots the extra point.


ON SCOREBOARD

"Giants 10 -- Redskins 10
 TIME REMAINING: 58 seconds."

ON SIDELINE

Murray and Lee are getting congratulations
from everyone.

                 PACIFICO
                (to Murray)
         What a hit!
                (slower)
         What a hit!

Murray nods that he understands.

                 EVANS
                (to Murray)
         I'm proud of you, kid.

Jamal and Andre are hugging Lee. In the
b.g., we can see paramedics lifting one of
Lee's four fans onto a stretcher.

                 ANDRE
         You're the one, you're
         the one, you're the
         one...

                 LEE
         You think that's worth
         a shoe deal?

McGinty walks into the middle of it.

                 McGINTY
         Stop with the lovefest!
         Let's get the goddamn
         ball back and win this
         thing!

  CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD - DAY

We're CLOSE ON Bateman as he lines up for the
kick-off. Everybody in the stadium knows
that an on-side kick is coming.

Bateman is standing in the hot spot for
recovering the ball.

Shane and everyone with decent hands is on
the field.

Pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards.

The ball takes a crazy hop, hits a Giant, and
ricochets off him.

Bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball
on the bounce. He's got it.

But Bateman doesn't go down. He turns and
starts running across the field.

Shane runs after him.

                 SHANE
         No! Danny, go down!
         You're using up the
         clock!

But Bateman likes this new job: kick-off
returner! Especially after he runs over a
Giant and stiff-arms another.

Bateman is finally trapped on the far
sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards.

So, he turns and starts running back the
other way.

Shane has been chasing him and now sees
Bateman running back at him.

Shane has no choice but to throw himself in
front of Bateman's legs.

Bateman goes down.

Shane jumps up:

                 SHANE
                (to ref)
         Time out!

Bateman looks up at Shane.

                 BATEMAN
         Beautiful tackle,
         Shane!

                 SUMMERALL
         (V.O.)
         Now that's something
         you don't see everyday!

ON CLOCK

Bateman has burned up most of the clock.
Eighteen seconds remain.


ON SIDELINE

McGinty, Shane and Pacifico confer.

                   SHANE
           We got time for one
           play, but if we don't
           get it out of bounds,
           the game is over.

                   McGINTY
           Yeah, but you're
           looking at a sixty-five
           yard kick from here.

                   PACIFICO
                  (smoking a butt)
           No problem.

                   SHANE
           Seriously?

                   PACIFICO
                  (to Shane)
           You hold it. I'll kick
           it.

McGinty looks at Shane and they both shrug.

                   McGINTY
           What the fuck.


ON SUMMERALL AND MADDEN

Madden can't believe it.

                   MADDEN
           I can't believe it!
           McGinty is gonna let
           Pacifico try the field
           goal from sixty-five
           yards out!

                   SUMMERALL
           Hey, John, this kid has
           got a heck of a foot.

                   STRAM
           But sixty-five yards?
           Come on!


ON SHANE

He's set up to receive the snap.

Pacifico lines himself up the way soccer-
style kickers do.

Then he takes a drag on his smoke, and flicks
it away.

                   MADDEN    (V.O.)
           Pat... did he    just? I
           think that guy    is
           smoking on the    field!

                   SUMMERALL
           (V.O.)
           No, I think you
           imagined that one,
           John.

Shane looks at Pacifico and his clean
uniform.

Then Shane looks at his own uniform which is
covered with blood, dirt, and grass stains.

Pacifico looks clean.

                   SHANE
           You look great, Lou,
           you know that?

Pacifico is really touched.

                   LOU
           Really? Thanks, Shane.
           That means a lot to me.

Shane turns to Evans who smiles at him
between his own legs.

                  SHANE
           Hut!

The snap is perfect.    Pacifico boots the shit
out of it.

ON BALL

End over end, yard after yard, it flies
straight and true.

                  MADDEN (V.O.)
          It's straight enough!
          If it's got the
          distance, it's...

The ball hits the crossbar and goes over.

                     MADDEN (V.O.)
          Good!     Redskins win!

Everybody goes crazy. Players are pounding
on Pacifico. But Pacifico is desperately
looking around for someone.

He spots him: It's Bateman running flat-out
across the field to congratulate him.

Pacifico runs for his life.

  CUT TO:


INT. APARTMENT DOOR - NIGHT

Shane knocks. After a beat, the door opens
and Annabelle is standing there rubbing her
eyes. She's wearing a cut-off Redskin
jersey.

                  ANNABELLE
          Are you hurt?

                     SHANE
          No.     Not really.

                  ANNABELLE
          You're getting used to
          being slapped around.
          That's a good sign.

                    SHANE
          I...

Nothing comes out.

                  ANNABELLE
          Would you like to come
          in and make love?

                 SHANE
         Yes. No. I'm here
         because ... I don't
         want to be alone.

                    ANNABELLE
         Most    of the world feels
         that    way. You don't
         have    to be embarrassed
         about    it.

                 SHANE
         But to tell you the
         truth... I'm kind of
         scared of you.

Annabelle takes that in and thinks about it.

                 ANNABELLE
         I won't hurt you.

She takes his hand and leads him inside.

  CUT TO:


INT. ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Annabelle is giving Shane a slow, sensuous,
full-body massage. It's lucky for us he's on
his stomach.

Shane does a lot of moaning as Annabelle's
fingers work their magic.

She gets to a place on his shoulder that's
especially tender. He moans even louder.

                 ANNABELLE
         That shoulder is going
         to need special
         handling.

Annabelle pulls her jersey off and gently
presses her breasts into Shane's back.

Shane puts a pillow over his head to drown
out the ecstasy.

After a beat, he pulls the pillow away.

                 SHANE
         You know what hurts

         worse than my shoulder?

                 ANNABELLE
         I can't imagine.

                 SHANE
         Their defensive end
         punched me in the
         mouth.

Annabelle starts laughing.

                 SHANE
         Seriously. It's
         killing me.

Annabelle is laughing hard now as Shane rolls
over.

  DISSOLVE TO:


INT. ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Shane and Annabelle are in a close, after-sex
kind of cuddle thing.

Shane is unburdening himself.

                 SHANE
         ... after that game,
         after being beaten that
         badly in front of the
         whole country, after
         humiliating myself, my
         team, my school, my
         family, I mean -- did
         you know that I set two
         Sugar Bowl records?! I
         was sacked eleven
         times! I threw six
         interceptions!

                  ANNABELLE
         Okay.   Calm down.

                 SHANE
         Anyway, after that, I
         could never seem to
         adjust in the pros. I
         was too scared. I lost
         my balls.

We see Annabelle's hand move slightly under

the covers.

                 ANNABELLE
         Well, they're back.

                 SHANE
         You know what I mean.
         My nerve. I lost the
         edge you need to play
         this game.

                 ANNABELLE
         I don't believe that.
         I don't think it just
         goes away. It was only
         one bad day, Shane.
         Everybody has those.

                 SHANE
         No. Somehow, I
         convinced myself that I
         couldn't ever win the
         big game. I got so
         down, that I was afraid
         to be playing when a
         game was on the line.
         I was afraid to screw
         up. That's the sure
         sign of a loser. From
         there, it wasn't very
         far to thinking that
         I'll never win, that I
         didn't deserve to win
         at anything. Including
         love.

                 ANNABELLE
         You're wrong. You're
         winning now. You're
         winning me.

They kiss real good.

EXT. O'NEIL MANSION - MORNING

It's a huge town house in Foggy Bottom.    Its

One is speaking ON CAMERA to his anchor.

                 REPORTER

         Bob, I'm standing in
         front of Redskins
         owner, Edward Frances
         O'Neil's home and all

         Any idea how
         Wilkinson's identity
         was discovered and who
         leaked it to the media?

                 REPORTER
         No, Bob, but rumor has
         it that the National
         Football League
         Player's Association
         had something to do
         with it.

                 ANCHOR
         Thanks, Hank.

         In other N.F.L. news,
         almost sixty percent of
         the regular players
         have now crossed the
         picket lines and more
         are crossing every day.
         The strike, now in its
         second week, is
         expected to go out with
         a fizzle. Most experts
         think that the Monday
         night Dallas/Washington
         game will be the last
         with replacement
         players. But even that
         game will feature at
         least 75 percent of the
         regular Cowboys. Coach
         James McGinty will try
         to make it a perfect
         three and O with a team
         made up totally of

         N.F.L. doesn't care if
         he played under an
         assumed name.
         Everything was legal.
         He was let out on a
         work release program.
         He'll be kept under
         house arrest but he'll
         still be able to play.

                 O'NEIL
         Where are we gonna keep
         him?

                 McGINTY
         In the stadium. We'll
         fix up something
         comfortable for him and
         he'll get his exercise
         by kicking the shit out
         of N.F.L. receivers.

                 O'NEIL
         How did you pull that
         off?

                 McGINTY
         How else? With your
         money.

                 O'NEIL
                (to Augustine)
         Take this cow piss out
         of here.

                 AUGUSTINE
         You used to love
         asparagus soup. They
         say that when the taste
         buds go, you're at the
         beginning of the end.

Augustine leaves with the tray.

                 McGINTY

         I want to keep Falco
         after the strike ends.
         As Martel's back-up.

                 O'NEIL
         Let's keep 'em all.
         The hell with the
         regulars.

                 McGINTY
         You've got to take the
         union players back once
         the strike ends. It's
         part of the collective
         bargaining agreement.

                 O'NEIL
         The hell I do! I'm
         dying! Let 'em sue me.

                 McGINTY
         They'll do worse than

            that. They'll close
            down the stadium.

                    O'NEIL
            God damn 'em! Then you
            got to beat Dallas.
            The whole country will
            be watching. All those
            millionaires down there
            deserve to have their
            noses rubbed in it.

                    McGINTY
            Ed, let's be honest:
            beating Dallas is gonna
            be a hell of a trick.

                    O'NEIL
            You can pull it    off.
            You proved that    winning
            doesn't have to    look
            pretty. These     boys are
            hungry for it,    Jimmy.
                    (MORE)

                    O'NEIL (CONT'D)
            There's nothin' more
            dangerous in all of
            sports than a hungry
            team. I remember back
            in '47, we were playing
            Nebraska in the mud...

                    McGINTY
                   (interrupting)
            Ed, I'm begging you --
            no Notre Dame stories.

                    O'NEIL
            Okay, Jimmy, okay. But
            you beat Dallas for me,
            and then I'll go gently
            into that night.

INT. CAR SHOWROOM - DAY

We're ON    Mickey Lee, who is wearing his
Redskin    game jersey with no pads. He's
stuffed    into a Cadillac Brougham, a big-ass
version    of the Caddy.

He's talking directly TO US.

                  LEE
          You'll score, too, with
          a Cadillac from Coleman
          Cadillac. It's a big
          car for a big man.

Mickey is very wooden as a spokesperson.    He
tries again.

                 (same thing)
          You'll score, too, with

          It's a big car for a

                  DIRECTOR (O.S.)
          That's good, Mickey,
          that's real good.
          Let's try it again.

Mickey looks game.


MONTAGE

A)   EXT. STADIUM

     Andre, Jamal, Brian Murray, Roland
     Lamont, Daniel Bateman, Lou Pacifico and
     Shane are standing outside the stadium
     after practice. They are all mobbed by
     autograph seekers.

All of them are signing as fast as they can.

B)   EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT

     The guys are on the grounds of the
     Washington Monument. They are lined up
     against a bunch of little kids. Shane
     takes the snap. (The ball is a miniature
     rubber football.)

     All the linemen fall down. The kids
     blitz and sack Shane for a big loss.

     Annabelle watches and laughs and claps.

C)   MICKEY LEE

      still crammed into the Cadillac.   He
      looks exhausted and pissed.

                   LEE
                  (in a monotone)
           You'll score, too, with
           a Cadillac from Coleman
           Cadillac. It's a big
           car, for a big man.

                   DIRECTOR (O.S.)
           Okay. Good. That was
           good. Let's try it
           again...

                   LEE
                  (exploding)
           What?! I'm not doing
           it again! Who are you,
           Orson Welles?! This is
           nuts!

      Lee tries unsuccessfully to get out of
      the car.

D)    ALL REPLACEMENT PLAYERS

      are lined up in Redskin jerseys, minus
      pads. It's team picture day and everyone
      looks happy to be there.

     CUT TO:


INT. HILTON - NIGHT

Shane walks down the hall to his room.        He
enters.


INT. SHANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

He walks in and closes the door.

When he turns around, Eddie Martel, ex-
Washington Redskin quarterback, is sitting on
Shane's bed.

Two defensive linemen-types stand by the
window.

                   SHANE
           What's this?

                 MARTEL
         This is a visit.

                 SHANE
         A visit. Who let you
         in?

                 MARTEL
         I used to nail one of
         the housekeepers.

                 SHANE
         Lucky girl.

                 MARTEL
                (pointing to the
                 linemen)
         You know who these guys
         are, don't you?

                 SHANE
         Dallas Cowboys.     Howdy.

                 MARTEL
         You'll be seeing a lot
         of these guys tomorrow.

                 SHANE
         What do you want?

                 MARTEL
         Who, me? Not much.
         But these boys wanted a
         little head start on
         you.

There's a beat and then Shane suddenly bolts
for the door. But the two linemen grab and
hold him.

                 SHANE
         I'm flattered that you
         actually think we have
         a chance to win.

                 MARTEL
         It can be a game of
         luck. And under no
         circumstances can we
         allow a scab team to go
         three and O.
         Especially against the
         Dallas Cowboys. It's
         just not good for the

         game.

                 SHANE
         Is the union behind
         this 'visit'?

                 MARTEL
         I can't really say,
         Shane. By the way,
         have you ever tried
         throwing a football
         with bruised ribs?

He kicks Shane viciously in the side.     Shane
screams.

                 MARTEL
         The pain makes it damn
         near impossible.

The linemen drops Shane on the floor.

                 MARTEL
         And one other thing: I
         want you to stay away
         from Annabelle.

Shane is gasping on the floor.

                 MARTEL
         The sad fact is she
         won't give me the time
         of day. But you can't
         have everything I want.
         I can't let that
         happen. So, you gotta
         stop seeing her. Just
         on principle.

Martel viciously kicks Shane again.     Shane
screams.

                 MARTEL
         Let me hear you say it.

Shane is trying to get his breath.

                 MARTEL
         Come on. You can do
         it.

                 SHANE
                (barely visible)
         I won't go out with her

         anymore.

                 MARTEL
         Good.
                (to the linemen)
         Gentlemen?
                (to Shane)
         Hey, have a great game!

They move toward the door.

EXT. BIG O - MAGIC HOUR

Once again, fans stream into the parking
lots.

In a corner of a lot, Jerome Lindell is once
again holding forth ON CAMERA.

But this time, he's standing with a hard-
looking guy in a suit, named MATHESON.

                 LINDELL
         I think that Mister
         Matheson here, and
         myself, are very close
         to an agreement that
         will put the 'pro' back
         in pro-football.

                 REPORTER
         Mister Matheson, what
         are the sticking points
         in the negotiations as
         far as the owners are
         concerned?

                 MATHESON
         Only one: that the
         players immediately go
         back to work with no
         change in the existing
         contract.

Lindell looks uncomfortable.   But he smiles
anyway.

INT. MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL BOOTH - NIGHT

The familiar "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL THEME
SONG" is just ending. AL MICHAELS does his
on camera intro.

                 AL
         Good evening from the
         Big O here in
         Washington D.C. where
         the mighty Dallas
         Cowboys take on the
         Cinderella Washington
         'Scabskins' as they
         have come to be known.
         Hi, I'm Al Michaels and
         we are witnesses to a
         unique matchup tonight
         as Shane Falco and a
         contingent of strike
         players go up against
         the entire regular
         squad of the Dallas
         Cowboys. Yes, you
         heard right: every
         Cowboy has now crossed
         the picket line, some
         as late as this
         afternoon, and they
         will all play tonight.
         Can a rag tag group of
         hasbeens and castoffs
         stand up to what was
         once called America's
         team? And what about
         the strike itself? It
         has been so ineffective
         that many predict it
         will be over before
         this game ends. Stay
         tuned as Boomer and Dan
         join me for strike
         ball, D.C. style.

INT. REDSKIN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone is just about dressed in their
uniforms and ready to go.

Lou Pacifico enters in street clothes and
starts undressing quickly. He looks worried.

Shane watches Lou for a beat. We see Shane
shift his upper body and grimace.

McGinty enters and pulls Shane aside.

                 McGINTY
         Congratulations. It's
         official. You're
         staying on after the
         strike.

Shane smiles in spite of the pain.

                 McGINTY
         It's probably better
         that you not say
         anything to the rest of
         the guys until after
         the game. Okay?

                 SHANE
         Whatever you say,
         Coach.

McGinty walks into the middle of the locker
room and goes into pre-game speech mode.

                 McGINTY
         Alright, listen up.
         The strike is just
         about history. By
         tomorrow, you will no
         longer be Redskins.
         It's important that you
         leave here, however,
         with the knowledge that
         you have made a
         difference in your own
         life, in the owner's
         life -- or what's left
         of it -- and especially
         the fans'. You have
         proven to a skeptical
         America that sports is
         not about contracts, or
         agents or shoe deals.
         Sports is about rising

         to the occasion. We
         have one more
         opportunity tonight to
         do that, one more
         chance to show what
         heart is all about.
         The Dallas Cowboys are
         waiting out there to
         kill you. I expect
         nothing less than for
         you to win even in your
         death throes. We have
         a powerful weapon on
         our side tonight:
         there is no tomorrow
         for most of you. And
         that makes you very
         dangerous people. Use
         it.

         That    is one    very big
         leg    on Lou    Pacifico.
         He's    a big    reason why
         this    strike    team is two
         and    0.

                 DAN
         But the fact is, a
         kicker does not an
         offense make. I think
         tonight the Scabskins
         will have a very rude
         awakening.

                 BOOMER
         But you have to admit,
         Dan, Falco is proving
         to be the real thing.

                   DAN
           Well, Boomer, no, I
           don't have to admit

Shane gives her a guilty wave and then
cringes with the pain of just having to lift
his arm.


ON LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

The Redskins line up. Cochran is opposite
Butler, the big tackle that "visited" Shane's
room.

                     COCHRAN
                    (to Butler)

           I just want to say what
           an honor it is to play
           opposite you. And if
           it's not too much
           trouble, I would love
           to have your autograph.

           No problem.

                    SHANE (O.S.)
           Hut!   Hut!

On the snap, Butler bashes Cochran's head
with his forearm and knocks his helmet off.
Then he runs over him.


ON SHANE

He under-throws a very weak-looking pass to
Lamont.

Shane grits his teeth against the pain.


ON COCHRAN

He's dazed and still on the ground.

Butler walks over and bends down to him.

Butler leans on Shane's side as he gets up.
Shane gasps with pain.

           What pursuit! Butler
           never gave up on him.
           That's a 270-pound guy

           halfback.

                   BOOMER
           Dan, I think Butler's
           hit on Falco was late,
           to tell you the truth.

                   DAN
           Well, of course you do.
           You were a wimp

     Boom! The ball goes through the uprights
     for a Dallas field goal.

     ON SCOREBOARD

     Dallas 10, Washington 0.

D)   AUGUSTINE

     massages O'Neil's feet as the old man
     watches the game. He looks worried.

E)   PACIFICO

     smokes and stalks the sidelines. He
     looks up into the stands and sees the
     mafioso type looking down at him.

F)   SHANE

     steps up in the pocket. He looks
     downfield but in the face of the pass
     rush, he throws the ball weakly out of
     bounds.

G)   LEE

     is pass-blocking but the first guy spins
     him around and the second guy runs right
     around him.

H)   BATEMAN

     is double-teamed on a pass rush. He
     spins but he can get no leverage against
     his opponents. When the play ends, he

     pushes one of them.

     A penalty flag flies by.

I)   ROLAND LAMONT

     takes a    pitch out, is immediately hit
     hard and    loses the ball. A cornerback
     picks it    up and takes it all the way for
     a Dallas    score.

J)   WILKINSON

     steps up and bats a ball away from a
     Dallas receiver. A flag flies.
     Wilkinson argues the call.

K)   COCHRAN

     is lined up across    from Butler. On the
     snap, Butler slaps    Cochran in the face
     mask with his big,    fat club of a hand.
     Cochran disappears    OUT OF FRAME.

L)   DALLAS KICKER

     Boom! The Dallas kicker puts away the
     extra point after a Dallas touchdown.

     SCOREBOARD

     Dallas 24, Washington 0.

M)   EDDIE MARTEL, WILSON JONES AND OTHER
     REDSKINS

     sitting in the stands look satisfied.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

The Redskins huddle. Shane is in pain.       He
looks up at the clock.


ON CLOCK

There's thirty-two seconds left in the half.

                     SHANE
           Okay.    Red right 15 X
           hook.

The break the huddle and come to the line of
scrimmage.

                  SHANE
          15 X hut!

Shane rolls right and looks downfield. He
holds the ball and keeps rolling. No one can
get open.

Suddenly, Lamont cuts in front of him and
yells:

                   LAMONT
          Shane!

Lamont sees an open lane and Shane follows
him. He eats up 15 yards before two
defensive halfbacks close in.

Lamont throws an incredible block and takes
out both guys.

Shane blows by and heads for the end zone.
Only a safety stands between Shane and pay
dirt.


CLOSE ON SHANE

His side is killing him with every step he
takes.

When the safety moves up on him, Shane panics
and goes down in the same kind of slide that
Eddie Martel did in the beginning.

Boom!   The GUN SOUNDS and the half ends.

Shane sees Redskin trainers running out onto
the field.

He turns and sees Lamont rolling on the
ground in pain as he holds his bad knee.

INT. MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL BOOTH - NIGHT

The boys are doing their half-time stand up.

                  AL
          That's the end of the

         first half and not
         surprisingly, it was
         all Dallas. The
         Cowboys had over two
         hundred yards
         offensively versus
         Washington's frankly
         pathetic thirty-eight
         yards. That's total
         offense. Falco got
         close to scoring on the
         last play of the half
         but he appeared to have
         slipped. By the way,
         running back Roland
         Lamont was hurt on that
         play and word is he's
         on his way to the
         hospital.

                 DAN
         Al, the battle is being
         fought and won in the
         trenches. You can't
         expect a bunch of pick-
         up players to stand up
         to a professional pass
         rush like the Cowboys.

                 BOOMER
         There's still a whole
         half left, Dan. And
         remember, Falco is
         proving to be a second-
         half quarterback.

                 DAN
         You got to be kidding.

                 BOOMER
         Those big, fat boys in
         the trenches get awful
         tired. You ought to
         know that, Dan.

No laughter.

                 AL
         Okay, let's join Chris
         Berman with our half-
         time show. Chris?

After a beat we hear:

                  DIRECTOR (V.O.)
         Clear!

                 AL
         What's wrong with you
         guys?!

                 BOOMER
         He started it.

                 DAN
         I did not! You called
         me fat!

                 BOOMER
         I did not! But you
         are!

Dan reaches across Al and grabs Boomer by the
throat.

                 AL
         Stop it!

The three of them start wrestling in the
booth.

  CUT TO:


INT. REDSKIN LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone is nursing a bruise or some sort of
wound. Shane is nowhere to be seen.

McGinty walks into the middle of the locker
room.

                 McGINTY
         Alright, listen up:
         The strike is
         officially over.
         They're announcing it
         on TV right now. So
         this is it, gentlemen.
         We have one half left
         to keep from being
         totally humiliated.
         You are better than the
         present score. You
         have nothing but your
         own self-respect riding
         on this game. It's up
         to you. Here's your

         swan song, people. How
         are you gonna sing it?

And with that he walks out.     Everybody looks
beaten and depressed.


EXT. OUTSIDE LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Shane stops two paramedics who push Roland
Lamont on a stretcher. Roland is really
hurting.

                 SHANE
         I'm sorry, Roland.
         That was a great block.

                 ROLAND
         For my last play in
         football, I'll take
         that block.

Shane looks terribly guilty.

                 ROLAND
         I thought you were
         going to score. What
         happened? Did you
         slip?

Shane can't look at him, but he nods.

                 ROLAND
         That's what I thought.

                 SHANE
         You were a warrior,
         Roland. I'm gonna miss
         you.

                 ROLAND
         It was a dream come
         true. Go kick some ass
         for me.

The paramedics roll him away.     Shane slumps
against the wall near tears.

McGinty comes out of the locker room.     He
locks eyes with Shane for a beat.

And then McGinty turns his back on him and
walks away.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Everyone is quiet.   Shane walks in.

SID, the equipment manager, sees him and
yells.

                 SID
         Hey, Shane, I just
         heard.
         Congratulations!

He smacks Shane on his bad side and Shane
grimaces.

                 WILKINSON
         Congratulations on
         what?

                 SID
         Shane is staying on.
         He's gonna be Martel's
         backup.

Everyone stares at Shane for a beat.

                 ANDRE
         Is that true?

                 SHANE
         Yes, Andre. It's true.

Nobody says anything for a beat.

                 FRANKLIN
         I got to tell you,
         Shane, you played the
         first half like you
         were staying. Like you
         already had a contract.

Shane looks around the room at this beaten
bunch. No one makes eye contact with him.

                 SHANE
         You're right, Clifford.
         And I'm sorry. But now
         I want to go out there
         and either beat these
         bastards or die trying.
         I never wanted to beat
         anybody so bad in my
         life.

Everybody lets this sink in.

Earl Wilkinson finally speaks up.

                 EARL
         I don't know what yawl
         are doin' tomorrow, but
         my ass is goin' back to
         jail. But if I gotta
         go, I want to go back a
         winner.

                 EVANS
         Hell, I'm retiring. I
         have thirty minutes of
         football left in my
         whole career. I'm
         homicidal!

                 BATEMAN
         Me, too, Reese!

                 EARL
         Let's get it on!

Everybody turns to Shane.

                 SHANE
         Gentlemen, our problem
         is the Cowboys aren't
         afraid of us. But they
         should be!

                 LAMONT
         Damn straight!

Everybody whoops!

                 SHANE
         We've got one chance on
         offense to make our
         stand -- the first play
         of the half.

                 JAMAL
         One touchdown ain't
         gonna help, Shane.

                    SHANE
         No.     But one nasty-ass
         play    might. We just
         gotta    be brave. And
         trust    each other.

Shane happens to glance at Pacifico.
Pacifico won't meet his eye.

Shane turns to Sid.

                  SHANE
          Help me with this.

Sid helps Shane strip his jersey off.

Everyone reacts to the bruises on Shane's
side.

                  SHANE
          Somebody has to tape me
          up.

  CUT TO:


EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

The Cowboys are already back on the field as
the Redskins come out of their locker room.

                  AL (V.O.)
          ... at nine-forty
          Eastern time, the
          agreement was reached,
          and except for this
          upcoming second half,
          the strike is history.


ON AL, DAN AND BOOMER

Boomer's tie is off and his shirt is torn.
Dan looks guilty, but still angry.

                  DAN
          It's about time. I say
          let the professionals
          back on the field. The
          fans deserve nothing
          less.

                  BOOMER
          Yeah, you would say
          that.


ON BALL

The Dallas kicker puts the ball in the end
zone for a touchback.


ON SHANE

He starts to follow the offense out on the
field. Then he turns and sees Annabelle
engrossed in a cheer.

He runs over to her.

                   ANNABELLE
           Are you okay? Is it
           your side?

                   SHANE
           I'm okay. I owe you an
           apology.

                      ANNABELLE
           What?     You do?

                   SHANE
           Yes. I'll explain
           later. But thank you
           for believing in me.
           You give me strength
           just looking at you.

And with that, Shane takes her in his arms
and kisses her deeply.

The crowd on that side of the field reacts to
the kiss with a "Wooooooo!"

                   AL (V.O.)
           Well, this is a first.
           Shane Falco seems to
           be...

                      BOOMER (V.O.)
           Hell,    Al, he's necking
           with    a cheerleader!
           I've    done a little of
           that    in my time.

                   DAN (V.O.)
           The players are not
           supposed to fraternize
           with the cheerleaders.

                   BOOMER (V.O.)
           Hey, Dan, what are they

            gonna do?   Fire him?!


ON SHANE

He breaks the kiss and looks up in the stands
at Eddie Martel.

Shane gives him the finger.

The crowd goes "Wooooo!" at that too.

Martel doesn't think this is funny.

Shane walks onto the field leaving a confused
but happy Annabelle.

He walks past Dallas defensive lineman
Butler.

                    BUTLER
            That wasn't too smart.

                    SHANE
            Suck my dick.

Butler is too shocked for a comeback.


ON HUDDLE

It breaks and Shane walks to the line of
scrimmage.

                    AL (V.O.)
            Here we go, first and
            ten for the Redskins.
            Twenty-four zip Dallas.

We can see now that Wilkinson and Bateman are
now part of the offense.

They line up as receivers opposite defensive
halfbacks. In fact, everyone but Shane is on
the line of scrimmage, paired up across from
a cowboy.

Shane leans over Reese and takes in the
Dallas defense.

The Dallas MIDDLE LINEBACKER yells at Shane.

                    LINEBACKER
            Are you ready for more

             pain, footsteps?

Shane just smiles.

                     SHANE
             Blue thirteen! Blue
             thirteen! Hut! Hut!
             Hut!


MONTAGE

On the snap, many things happen at once:

A)   COCHRAN

     sticks his fingers inside Butler's face
     mask and pokes both eyes. Butler
     screams!

B)   SHANE

     throws the ball as hard as he can at the
     middle Linebacker and hits him in the
     crotch. The guy grabs himself and
     collapses.

C)   CLIFFORD FRANKLIN

     kicks his defender in the shins as hard
     as he can. The defender screams and
     falls down.

D)   BATEMAN

     gets a cornerback across from him in a
     choke    hold. The guy can't breathe but
     Bateman holds on.

E)   WILKINSON

     lifts up his defender's face guard and
     connects with a right hand to the guy's
     chin.

F)   LEE

     pulls the defensive lineman in front of
     him to the ground. Then he falls on him.
     The guy screams.


ON FIELD

All across the line of scrimmage, Redskins
are punching, kicking and gouging the Dallas
defense.

WHISTLES BLOW.   Flags fly everywhere.

Most of the Dallas players are down and
screaming.

Jamal stands across from a DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.
He hasn't touched the guy. But he nods to
the player to look at his hand.

The guy looks down just as Jamal flicks open
a deadly-looking switchblade.

The guy jumps back and yells:

                 DEFENDER
         He's got a knife!

But there is so much confusion that nobody
pays any attention. Jamal slips the knife
away.

                 AL (V.O.)
         Whoa! Flags fly
         everywhere! I've never
         seen anything like
         this!

                 BOOMER (V.O.)
         Unbelievable! One
         Washington player had a
         Cowboy in what appeared
         to be a police choke
         hold.

                 DAN (V.O.)
         I see at least five
         flags... no six!

The officials are going crazy trying     to
figure out the penalties as Shane and     the
offense back up and make room for the     Dallas
medical staff who come running out on     the
field.

Some Dallas players are livid:

                 BUTLER
                (to the Ref)
         He scratched my eyes
         out!

                    LINEBACKER
            He hit me on purpose!


ON McGINTY

He's smiling to himself on the sidelines.


ON REFEREE

He faces the cameras, turns on his microphone
and sums up the penalties.

                    REF
            Unsportsmanlike
            conduct, number 72,
            number 81 and number 87
            on the offense, fifteen
            yards...
                   (to himself)
            ... times three...
            that's forty-five
            yards. Illegal use of
            hands, number 48 on the
            offense, fifteen yards.
            That makes it sixty
            yards. Unnecessary
            roughness number 65 and
            number 32, fifteen
            yards... that's,
            wait... forty-five...
            no, thirty...
                   (turns to
            another
                    ref)
            ... how many yards so
            far?


ON BALL

A ref is taking a very long walk with it. He
stops at the Redskin two-yard line and puts
it down.


IN HUDDLE

Shane leans in.

                    SHANE
            Okay, everybody, stick

              together and don't take
              any shit. Let's make
              'em hurt!

They break the huddle and line up with their
backs to their goal.


ON COCHRAN AND BUTLER

Butler is still whining.

                      BUTLER
              I can't believe you
              went for my eyes!

                      COCHRAN
              Shut up! I'm gonna do
              it again 'cause it was
              fun!


ON SHANE

                      SHANE
              Black 98! Black 98!
              Hut!


ON COCHRAN

He drops Butler with a vicious forearm.

Shane flicks the ball over the middle to
Murray who pulls it in for fifteen yards and
a first down.

     CUT TO:


MONTAGE - FOURTH QUARTER STUFF

A)    BATEMAN

      (now at running back) sweeps outside with
      Jamal and Reese Evans leading the way.
      Both linemen growl as they throw
      themselves into the defense.

B)    SHANE

      is rolling right with Butler on his
      heels. Just when it looks like Butler
      has him, Cochran comes out of nowhere and

     cuts Butler at the knees. Shane fakes a
     throw and keeps the ball for a fifteen-
     yard gain.

C)   SHANE

     hits Franklin with a short flick pass.

D)   BATEMAN

     runs off tackle and scores.

E)   PACIFICO

     kicks the extra point.     Scoreboard:
     Dallas 24, Redskins 7.

F)   WILKINSON

     blitzes from his safety position and
     decks the Dallas quarterback.

G)   BATEMAN

     stops a runner at the line of scrimmage
     and throws him for a loss.

H)   WILKINSON

     takes a punt at his own thirty. With
     Bateman blocking, Wilkinson springs to
     the outside and goes all the way for a
     touchdown.

     Pacifico kicks the extra point.
     Scoreboard: Dallas 24, Redskins 14.

I)   DALLAS FIELD GOAL KICKER

     is set to boot one. The ball is snapped,
     the kicker moves forward and suddenly
     Brian Murray breaks through the offense
     and blocks the kick.

J)   SHANE

     hits Franklin on a little down and out.
     He's hit by the defender, the ball goes
     flying but so does a flag.

     Pass interference.   Redskin first down.

K)   ON CLOCK

   Four minutes six seconds remain.

       CUT TO:


EXT. HUDDLE - DAY

The Redskin huddle breaks.   The guys come to
the line of scrimmage.

                   AL (V.O.)
           First and ten at the
           Cowboy twenty and I'm
           telling you, we are
           looking at a totally
           different team here in
           the second half.

                   BOOMER (V.O.)
           Absolutely, Al. The
           Redskins are playing
           like there's no
           tomorrow, because, hey,
           there isn't!

                   DAN (V.O.)
           I gotta agree with you
           on this one. The
           surprising thing for me
           is how ineffectual the
           Cowboys have been in
           this half. I mean,
           they look totally
           intimidated.

                   AL (V.O.)
           I love when you guys
           agree.


ON SHANE

He's in the shotgun calling signals.

                    SHANE
           Hut!   Hut!

He gets the snap and starts looking downfield
for receivers.


ON COCHRAN

He slips while he's blocking Butler who takes

advantage of the situation and blows by him.


ON SHANE

He's got Franklin crossing in the end zone.
He cocks and throws, and simultaneously gets
decked by Butler.


ON BALL

A Dallas defensive halfback     goes up for    it
but just tips the ball. It      keeps going    now
end over end... right into     the waiting    arms
of Franklin who is standing     by himself    in the
end zone.

Franklin is shocked.   His teammates run INTO
FRAME and mob him.

                   AL (V.O.)
           Touchdown, Skins!     What
           a fluke!

                   BOOMER (V.O.)
           Total luck there, Al.
           Makes up for the
           perfect ones they drop.

                   DAN (V.O.)
           Maybe not so lucky.
           Falco is down.


ON SHANE

He's on his back.


ON ANNABELLE

She looks worried as trainers run out onto
the field.


ON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE

They're watching in O'Neil's bedroom.


ON SHANE

Trainers are bending over him.      He's out but

he's mumbling:

                 SHANE
         Put your tits on my
         head...

A trainer hears that and looks worried.

Shane's teammates run up and carry him off
the field.


ON FRANKLIN

He's holding for Pacifico on the extra point.

On the snap, Franklin bobbles the ball but
manages to put it down.

Pacifico belts it through the uprights.

Scoreboard:    Dallas 24, Washington 21.

  DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SIDELINE - DAY

Shane is sitting on the bench holding his
head and his side. He's talking quietly to
McGinty.


ON WILKINSON

He's on the field calling for a fair catch.
He makes it.

                 AL (V.O.)
         ... one minute twenty
         remaining, and even
         though Dallas didn't
         score, they sure ate up
         a lot of the clock.


ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON

He's leading the offense out onto the field.

                 BOOMER (V.O.)
         And it looks like Falco
         cannot answer the bell.
         He's still on the bench

           and it    appears that
           safety    Earl Wilkinson
           will be    leading the
           Redskin    offense.

                   DAN (V.O.)
           They just need to get
           the ball in field goal
           range.

                   AL (V.O.)
           And for Pacifico,
           that's anything up to
           sixty-five yards.


ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON

He takes the snap from the shotgun and keeps
the ball on a sweep. He plows for twelve
yards.

                   AL (V.O.)
           That's good for twelve
           yards. The clock stops
           on the first down. The
           Redskins have no time-
           outs left.


ON SHANE

McGinty is still bent over him.

                   McGINTY
           I need your hands in
           there for the field
           goal. I can't trust
           Franklin to hold. He
           almost dropped the
           extra point.

Shane is in major pain but nods his head.

                   SHANE
           I can do it.


ON WILKINSON

He rolls again, but no one is open. He
crosses the line of scrimmage, is hit and
goes down.

ON CLOCK

It continues to run and passes twenty seconds
as we watch.


ON REDSKINS

They're hurrying back to the line of
scrimmage. Wilkinson stands over center.

On the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out of
bounds.

                   AL (V.O.)
           Wilkinson throws it
           away, and with twelve
           seconds remaining, the
           Redskins will try a
           forty-eight yard field
           goal to tie it up.
           That's almost a chip
           shot for Pacifico.


ON SHANE

He shakily follows Pacifico out onto the
field.

Reese Evans catches up with him.

                   EVANS
                  (to Shane)
           Are you okay?

                   SHANE
           Just make it a good
           snap.
                  (to Pacifico)
           And you'll do the rest,
           right?

Pacifico doesn't answer.


ON BALL

Evans leans over it.


ON SHANE

He's kneeling in the middle of the field
waiting for the snap. But something is
bothering him.

                   SHANE
                  (to Pacifico)
           Lou, are you alright?

Pacifico looks up from where he is set up for
the kick. There are tears in his eyes.

                   PACIFICO
           I'm sorry. They know
           where my family lives.

Shane tries to digest what he just heard.

                     SHANE
           What?!

                     EVANS
                    (through his
           legs)
           Come on, Shane!

Shane looks back at Pacifico and makes a
decision.

                     SHANE
           Hut!

The ball is snapped perfectly.      Shane catches
it and spots it perfectly.

Pacifico moves to kick it.

And Shane pulls the ball away.

Pacifico flies through the air like Snoopy as
he kicks nothing but air. He lands hard.

Shane jumps to his feet and starts running.

                   AL (V.O.)
           It's a fake! Falco has
           it!


ON McGINTY

He's in shock.


ON SHANE

He has totally caught the Cowboys by
surprise. He sweeps around the right side.

The Dallas middle linebacker has recovered
and is moving quickly to cut Shane off.

But Reese Evans comes out of nowhere and
crushes the guy with a flying block.

Shane cuts downfield and heads for the end
zone with nobody near him, except:

For the same safety from the first half who
waits for him at the ten.

The safety smiles as he takes a bead on
Shane.

Shane heads right for the guy. He puts his
head down and smacks helmets with the safety.
The guy goes down and Shane runs over him and
into the end zone.

                    AL (V.O.)
            Falco scores!


ON McGINTY

He jumps into the air.


ON O'NEIL

He jumps out of bed.


ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They jump on each other.


ON ANNABELLE

She's jumping for joy.


ON SHANE

He spikes the shit out of the ball.   And then
sees something up field.

                   AL (V.O.)

            Wait a minute. Wait a
            minute. We've got a
            flag down.

Shane stands stock-still in the end zone
watching the REF call the penalty.

                    REF
            Clipping. Number 77
            offense.


ON MICKEY LEE

He's wearing number 77 and he collapses in
tears.


ON TODD, ROD AND BOB

They are now sobbing in agony.


ON O'NEIL

He's being helped back to bed by Augustine.


ON SHANE

He's walking slowly back to the line of
scrimmage.


ON McGINTY

He looks sick.

Shane walks up to Pacifico who is down. His
arm is being immobilized by a team trainer.

                    PACIFICO
            I broke my arm.
                   (big smile)
            Thank you. You saved
            my ass.

Shane nods.     In his earpiece, he hears
McGinty.

                    McGINTY (V.O.)
            Someday, you can
            explain what that was
            all about. We got no

         kicker, so you gotta
         take it in. Your pick.
         You're the leader.

                 SHANE
                (to himself)
         What would Unitas do in
         this situation?
                (pause)
         I have no idea.

Shane leans into the huddle.

                 LEE
         I'm so sorry, Shane.
         I'm sorry, everybody.

                 SHANE
         No problem, Mickey.
                (to Evans)
         Hell of a hit, Reese.

                 EVANS
         That's the one I was
         looking for. I can
         retire in peace now.

                 SHANE
         Right after this play.
         So besides me, who
         really wants the ball?

He looks around the huddle. He studies each
face. And then he comes to rest on Brian
Murray.

Brian's eyes are shining.   He doesn't need
words here.

                 SHANE
                (to Murray)
         Yeah. You want it,
         Brian. Let's hook up.
                (signs as he
         says
                 it)
         Blue left slot open
         'A' right. Two Jet
         'X' drive. On three.
         Gentlemen, it's been an
         honor sharing the field
         of battle.

Everybody puts their hands into the middle.

They break the huddle with a roar.


ON CLOCK

Three seconds are showing.


ON LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

Shane leans over Reese and calls it.

                    SHANE
            Blue 58! Blue 58!
            Hut! Hut! Hut!

Shane nods.     On the snap, Shane rolls left.


ON REESE EVANS

He cuts his man at the knees.


ON MICKEY LEE

He takes two men down.


ON MURRAY

He cuts on a deep post.


ON SHANE

He steps up and throws a clean bullet
downfield. He roars in pain as he throws it.


ON MURRAY

The pass is perfect. He pulls it in and
beats his man to the end zone.

Redskins win.


ON CROWD

It roars! "Hail to the Redskins" is
deafening.

Todd, Rod and Bob are screaming.

O'Neil kisses Augustine.

Annabelle throws a punch into the air.

McGinty is all smiles.     Shane walks up to him
and they shake hands.

Pilachowski and Banes hug.

Lee and Andre are hugging and crying.

Cochran is on his knees praying.     Reese Evans
joins him.

Wilkinson hugs Jamal.

Clifford Franklin, hometown boy, throws
himself into the stands where fans mob him.


ON EDDIE MARTEL

The Washington Redskins first-string
quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from
his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps
and out of the stadium.

But he slips awkwardly and falls.     He grabs
his knee and screams.


ON BRIAN MURRAY

He's still in the end zone, holding the ball
up to the crowd. The roar is deafening.


BRIAN'S POV

We HEAR NOTHING, but somehow the pure energy
of the moment comes through.


ON SHANE

IN the SILENCE, he's walking in SLOW MOTION
toward Annabelle. And everybody is smiling.


  FADE OUT.

               The motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens 
               the trunk. The car has New Mexico license plates KBB-283. In 
               every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will 
               be 127-GBH.

               The motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair 
               of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was 
               co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith). Parnell watches from

                         brought to my attention that you're 
                         not paying attention to the way you 
                         space the cans. Many young men of your

               Otto grabs Kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, 
               and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described 
               as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used 
               to make the shot work).
 
               Louie pulls his gun.

                                     LOUIE
                         (Basta!)

                         You gotta love getting fired from your 
                         job in a big way, Otto.
 
                                     MR. HUMPHRIES
                         What are you laughing at? Louie, throw 
                         him out too.
 
                                     LOUIE
                         Come on you  worm. Get out of here.
 
                         
               Louie shoves Kevin down aisle where Otto is walking out. Otto 
               takes off his clip-on bow tie and tosses it back towards Louie. 
               Louie twirls his gun and puts it away. Note that the store aisle 
               is lined with nothing but generic products, plain black lettering 
               on white background. All products in movie from now on will have 
               this appearance.

               Otto is there slamdancing and Duke walks up, the two of them 
               swing each other around. Behind them, the graffiti on the wall 
               says "Circle Jerks", a band which will appear later in the movie.

               Otto enters bedroom where Debbi is waiting in bed.

               Otto lays back on the bed and puts his hands behind his head.

               Debbi pulls back his shirt a little and begins kissing his stomach, 
               then stops.

               Otto turns on light and finds Duke there with Debbi.

               Jazz music plays on the radio. In almost all scenes inside of 
               Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio.
 
               In this sequence the background changes from day to night, back 
               to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) 
               even though the dialog seems continuous. I believe that this 
               was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed 
               events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed 
               the continuity. It's clearer in the TV version where there truly 
               is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting.

               Bud gets sledgehammer from car and destroys phone while Otto

                         really going on. They view life as a 
                         bunch of unconnected incidences and 
                         things. They don't realize that there's 
                         this like lattice of coincidence that 
                         lays on top of everything. I'll Give 
                         you an example, show you what I mean.

                         same. There ain't no difference between 
                         a flying saucer and a time machine.

                         Take South America for example. In South

                         go. They just like disappear. But if 
                         you think about it for a minute, you 
                         realize something. There had to be a 
                         time when there was no people. Right?

               Otto takes down his pants (according to the filmmakers, Estevez 
               enjoyed doing this on a regular basis. Maybe they were just joking?).

               Chevy Malibu exits car wash and pulls up to gas pumps.

               That's director Alex Cox wiping the car as it pulls away from 
               the car wash and over to the pumps.
 
               The pumps at the gas station say "Pace Gas". Next to the pump 
               is a campaign poster for Harry Pace, running for City Council. 
               These posters appear elsewhere in the film. In his posters, Harry 
               Pace has a happy face.

               Kevin walks over to Malibu.

                         Look, there's a nice Del Taco across 
                         the street. They've got enchurritos

               Parnell walks off screen and we hear puking sounds.

               Lagarto gets in the Malibu and both cars drive off. Kevin returns 
               from inside and sees both cars gone. Two other attendants sit 
               at a table and also look; the attendant on the right is director 
               Alex Cox.

               Otto walks outside and gets in car. From outside we hear Mrs. 
               Parks yelling at her son.

                         I gave you the money last week to pay 
                         it and you didn't do it. What did you 
                         do with it? I'm so tired of giving you 
                         money and you squandering it. I know 
                         what you done you all went out dancing 
                         some where. That's what you did. Next 
                         time I give you some money I want you 
                         to put it in the car ya hear. You're 
                         working. How come you didn't do it huh? 
                         I don't know what's happened to you. 
                         (continues softly)
 
               Otto starts car and guns engine, but now we clearly see that 
               the rear wheels are up on jacks (that it wasn't up on jacks before 
               has been listed as a goof and even confirmed by Alex Cox, but 
               I think they're wrong. It is hard to tell in the dark, but you 
               can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the 
               house which goes dark as a band member runs in front of it on 
               the other side of the car, thus confirming that the car actually 
               was up on jacks in all the scenes).
 
               Band members run out of house and pull Otto out of car.

                                     OTTO
                         Hey it's cool. It's cool. I like music 
                         too man, hey
 
               Otto gets beat up. One band member hits him twice over the head 
               with a guitar, making an audible "kabong" noise. Supposedly you 
               can hear one member saying "this one's for Keith Moon", but I've 
               never been able to make it out.
 
               Miller, Plettschner and Otto in the lot.

               Miller is chanting and dancing like a native American as he puts

               Lagarto and Napoleon in the Malibu

               They pull up in front of a diner.

               Archie, Duke, and Debbie exit a window and go down a fire escape 
               [dropping armloads of pills as they go]. Behind them, a sign

               Archie and Duke run by the Malibu. Debbie stops, whistles and 
               gets in the car. Archie and Duke jump in and they drive off to 
               the sound of a Latino version of The Ride of the Valkyries. Lagarto 
               walks out of the phone booth just as this is happening and drops 
               his clipboard in disgust. Napolean walks out of the store, silently 
               hands Lagarto a soda, and they both stand there and sip their 
               drinks through straws.

                         limp torso to the truck. And he feels

               Otto sees the Malibu and gives chase. Losing the car, he stops

               as it goes through a railroad crossing which has red lights blinking 
               and bell ringing. J. Frank Parnell stops and lets him in.

                         I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine, 
                         was a designer of the MX missile race 
                         track basing mode. A hundred thousand 
                         miles of railroad track on a big loop 
                         through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs 
                         were going to hide in locomotive sheds. 
                         That way the red team would never know 
                         exactly where they were. I still go 
                         out to Utah, just to think about the 
                         way things might have been.

                         its bad for you. Pernicious nonsense!

                         too. When they canceled the project 
                         it almost did me in. One day my mind 
                         was literally a-burst. The next day 
                         nothing. Swept away... But I showed 
                         them. I had a lobotomy in the end.

                         Leaves buildings standing. It fits in 
                         a suit case. It's so small no one knows 
                         it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin 
                         explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral 
                         working on the thing can drive you mad.

                         of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's

               Bud sneaks his gun out. Louie sees him from down an aisle.

               Louie now sees the others with the guns. Bud waves his back and 
               forth. Debbi shoots Bud in the head.

                         Oww shit (shoot).

               Duke shoots Louie. Louie goes down but manages to shoot Duke, 
               but then is out of bullets. Duke walks over to Louie to finish 
               the job, but the counterman pulls out a shotgun and shoots Duke. 
               Debbie shoots the counterman. Now only Debbie and Otto are left 
               standing.

               Otto and Marlene enter elevator with 2 health professionals. 
               Lagarto turns away woman on crutches trying to get in.

               Cut back to ER waiting room where nurse is talking to patient 
               who has just filled out a form.

                         they expect you to pick it up.
 
               Otto and Marlene see a door with a pine tree air freshener hanging 
               from the knob. It's Bud's room. They go in.

                         Otto!

               Otto, Marlene and the Rodriguez brothers get chased by the agents 
               down the stairs.
 
               Back in Bud's room

                         Shit (shoot). (starts to get up off

                         Praise the lord.

               Otto, Marlene and Rodriguez brother drive off and the agents 
               chase them through the parking garage.
 
                                     NAPOLEON

                         Come on. Let's go.

               As they drive off and agents run after, the glowing Malibu drives 
               by and strikes down two of the agents with lightening bolts.
 
               
                                     OTTO

               Agent Rogersz blocks the exit and they are all caught.

                         Where's the Malibu?

                                     OTTO
                         Don't even ask because I don't know.

                         have it you and your crazy friends don't 
                         have it. So that only leaves...
 
               Everybody in Bud's hospital room

               Bud is gone.

                                     AGENT

                         Where the fuck (hell) is he.

               They escape the agents. Marlene and the brothers drive off as 
               Otto breaks into and steals a car.

               Otto arrives at Helping Hands lot while it rains ice cubes.
 
               
               Bud is sitting in the glowing Malibu.

    WHITE Revision   -   6-6-07                                  1.



1   INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY                                      1

    WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are
    listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.

    We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a
    changing city, LONDON.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
              Two years ago this property cost one
              million pounds.
                  (we SEE building)
              Today, it costs five million.

    The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to
    see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera
    will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.
                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
              How did this happen?
                  (CUT TO relevant
                   pictures as he speaks)
              Attractive tax opportunities for
              foreign investment, restrictive
              building consent and massive hedge
              fund bonuses,...
                  (beat)
              London, my good man, is fast becoming
              the financial and cultural capital
              of the world.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              And of course the Russians have come
              to town.

                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Makes it hard to compete with an ex-
              Soviet oligarch that has six billion
              dollars in his back pocket. They
              don't haggle the price, they double
              the price.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Russians come, prices rise, and it
              doesn't stop. It only goes one way.

                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Up.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              I can't teach you how to skin a cat,
              but I can tell you a lot about the
              money in bricks and mortar.

                 Like he said, it's going one way.

    building plans.

                             LAWYER TYPE
              These are the plans,...it costs ten
              and it'll be worth twenty with
              planning. But first you gotta give
              the councilor a drink.

5   INT. COUNCILOR'S OFFICE                                          5

     One two is on the phone.      He looks over to Mumbles.

                              ONE TWO
               He can't get the planing.

     Lenny is looking out to One Two and Mumbles who are standing
     outside his car looking very white. Lenny screams from the
     back seat.

                              LENNY COLE
               What do you mean you can't get the
               fuckin planning?
                   (pointing)
               There is seven million of my cash in
               there, without planning it's worth
               five,...you owe me. I take the
               building, you lose your share, but I
               am still outta pocket two large ones.
               Find it.

     The window goes up and the car pulls off.      Lenny picks up
     his phone, he dials huffing and puffing.

     with photographs of old soccer stars.

     On each side of him are two ESCORTS(ex-military types, heavy
     looking). As they pass each door, we realize where ever he
     is going, it has to be important. The ESCORTS talk in to
     their microphones and to the different GUARDS on each door
     way.

     Every now and then we see the SPORTS ARENA in the back ground.
     At last we reach the main door to the head office.

14   INT. HEAD OFFICE                                                 14

     As the door is opened we see a small crowd of MEN in suits
     gathered around a kind-looking MAN with bright blue eyes.
     He nods a couple of times.

     We CUT TO the front of Lenny who is clearly impressed, Mr.
     Blue eyes pays him no attention. The small crowd of business
     MEN shake hands and head to the door at which Lenny is waiting
     patiently.

15   INT. SPORTS ARENA -- DAY                                         15

     CLOSE UP on the back of URI (Russian Jew, 40s, slick, and
     well groomed, he is our Mr. Blue Eyes) overlooking his sports
     arena. We stay on the back of Uri's head while he is talking
     to Lenny.

                             URI
               Glad you could join us here Lenny.

                             LENNY COLE
               It's nice to see you Uri.

                             URI
               Good.
                   (there is a pause)
               I can see we are very much alike you
               and I Lenny. We like to get things
               done.
                   (beat)
               What's it going to cost me?

                             LENNY COLE
               First, let me make clear how much we
               can help you benefit from this deal.
               With out me, it will take you five
               to ten years to get the permission
               to erect your arena.
                   (beat)
               Second, with Government policy as it
               so stands we both know it's unlikely
               that you'd ever get that consent.
                   (beat)
               Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions
               and building consent, you'd be paying
               6 to 12 million without any real
               guarantee of that result.

     We CUT TO Uri unfazed, he just wants the figure.

     Still unfazed.

                              URI
               I expect a guarantee that I have
               consent within six months and no red
               tape.

               That's right Uri, you can consider

     Pause while tension stews, then,...

16   INT. SPORTS ARENA - PRIVATE BAR                                 16

     Uri walks to the bar. Lenny follows trying to contain his
     excitement, he's out of his league, a "welcome to the
     billionaires club" look has struck him pink. Lenny passes a
     PICTURE that's sat on an EASEL.

                              LENNY COLE
               Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't
               it got, errrh depth?

     Uri is at the bar now. He has placed one large tumbler down
     and is pouring a very very large measure out.

                              URI
               That picture has brought me nothing
               but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky
               picture.
                   (he has a good idea)
               You like? Take it for a while, maybe
               it will give you luck.

                              LENNY COLE
               Oh I couldn't Uri,...

     Still absorbed with the painting.

                              URI
               Now we're partners, I insist. I
               will get it sent around to your house
               and you can give it back to me when
               our deal is finalized.

     Lenny looks at the bar. Uri motions, there is a SMALL KEG
     of WHISKEY on the bar and only one large glass.

     Lenny enters the back seat of his car, Archy is waiting for
     him in the back.

     TURBO (Lenny's driver) is fumbling around in the front seat
     trying to get ice into a glass from the cooler that sits
     beside him.

                              LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Stop messing about and give us the

               So, how's the billionaires club?

     Lenny grabs the drink, desperately takes a big glug of water
     and wipes his face.

               the full forty out of my clients.

                  Save that speech for the tourists
                  Charlie and let's strike a deal -
                  take the twenty now and let it go.
                  Otherwise, they'll move the company
                  off shore tomorrow and you'll spend
                  the next twenty years chasing an
                  imaginary forty million around every
                  republic that grows bananas.

     The two TAX MEN look at each other, they're thinking the
     same thought.

                  I told you we'd make a great team,..
                  You know why you get those deals?

     She looks relatively bored.

                              BERTIE (CONT'D)
                  Because those fat, sad, old men like
                  it when you swear at them. They
                  shake like cocktails and sweat like
                  semtex when you raise that posh little
                  voice. You my love are a rare
                  commodity.

                  I don't feel like smiling. I am a

                  times.

                  but you didn't ask for no dry ice.
                  You asked for two cases of Johnny

                  of the pole and I got them for you

                  rocker. You've got on the managers
                  hat, now pluck something out of it.

                                 MICKEY
                  My hat is deep and full of magic. I
                  got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies
                  of the pole drinking Black Label. I
                  got smoke machines, bubble machines,
                  I even got love marines and still
                  the hat goes deeper, but....there

     distraction of JACKIE on the next door court. ARCHY is here
     watching over the game and reading the paper, we see him
     read an article and look a little moved. Lenny comes up
     behind him and starts to read over his shoulder.

                              LENNY COLE
               Johnny Story singer extraordinare,
               fell off a boat, missing, assumed
               dead.

                              ARCHY
               I don't know what to say Lenny.

                              LENNY COLE
               I bet he took a lot of people with
               him in his hot little crack pipe.
                   (beat)
               We will never mention this again,
               all right Arch?

     Archy looks a little shocked.     Lenny carries on like nothing
     has happened.

                              LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Now, tell the Councilor to stop fuckin
               about with sticks and balls and send
               him inside.

                Very good councilor, you must of had
                lessons as a boy.
                    (beat)
                Fancy a cool down and a chat with
                Lenny?

     The Councilor slyly looks over to Jackie, she looks back.
     The Councilor is thinking explicit thoughts.

                             ARCHY (CONT'D)
                Do you know Jackie?

     Nervous, the Councilor knows these thugs aren't shy.

                             COUNCILOR
                No, no, no, Archy, don't say anything.
                             ARCHY
                Don't worry, she's a friend,..and a
                member.

                Jackie,..fancy a run'a'round with
                the Councilor?

     Pause.   She looks sullen, stroppy and rude all at the same
     time.

                             JACKIE
                Only if he's wicked.

     She turns away to hit a ball, the Councilor's heart skips a
     beat.

                             COUNCILOR
                    (excited and shy)
                What does she mean by that?

                I think she likes you boy-o.

27   INT. TENNIS CLUB BAR                                            27

     Lenny is at the bar on his own looking at the papers and
     picking at the nuts. In walks the Councilor with Archy, the
     Councilor sits next to Lenny at the bar.

                             LENNY COLE
                They say that times are changing
                Councilor, that this country isn't
                what it used to be, it's the new New
                York, they say. You being a political
                man must know all about that.

                             COUNCILOR
               Errh, I think they are probably right,
               times have changed, but that shouldn't
               affect you Lenny.

                             LENNY COLE
               They say it's all gone "international"
               now, out with the old guard in with
               the new, but I think they're wrong.
                   (beat)
               Anyway, where are my manners? Look

               as a pelican,...and I haven't even
               offered you a wet one.

                             COUNCILOR
               A lemonade and orange please.
                             LENNY COLE
               Oh that's nice,..refreshing, that'll
               put you back on top boy.

     Lenny pulls out the plans and a leather pack of cigars.

                             LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Here you go, plans and papers.

               Would you like a cigar?

                             COUNCILOR
               I don't mind if I do,...that's a
               nice lighter.

                             LENNY COLE
               Eight grand they wanted for it cheeky
               toads and I paid, you know why?

                             COUNCILOR
               Tell me Lenny.

                             LENNY COLE
               'Cos it's all about the details.

     Looking at the plans.

                             COUNCILOR
                   (awkwardly)
               Is our little deal in there too Lenny?

     Lenny milks the silence while he lights his cigar, the
     Councilor feels like a prick waiting, it goes on and on.

     Lenny looks back to the Councilor.

               Can't be mine, it's got your name on

28   EXT. PARK - MORNING                                                 28

     It's the next morning, we SEE One Two running. Mumbles and
     Handsome Bob pull up along side of him in their car. There
     is a moment of pause while they admire One Two running along
     side of them.

                              MUMBLES
               Don't you get bored of that? I mean,
               your not really going anywhere. If
               you wanna run, why don't you run to
               the shops or do something useful?

                              ONE TWO
               You could do with some of this

               I reckon he's trying to get fit for

               A straight going, cocky, educated,

               Bob on her. That'll liven you up

               Bob wouldn't know where to begin.

               I'm good with the posh ones, don't
               you worry about that.

     He suddenly stops. His eyes have spotted something scary,
     the office chair disappears from under him, he takes the

30   INT. LENNY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER                             30

     Lenny's still pacing, a small gathering of tired looking
     HOOLIGANS are lined up in Lenny's office.

                             BANDY
               Where was it Len?

     Lenny is standing in front of the fire place smoking and
     looking very anxious.

     There is a bald spot above his head where a picture once
     stood, a picture light illuminates an clearly empty space.
     He is horrified by the stupidity of the question.

                               LENNY COLE
                  Let's take a wild stab in the dark
                  shall we Bandy? Archy slap him and
                  then send him to school 'cos I can't
                  take any more of this. You sort it
                  out, get that picture back and bring
                  me a body, I am going to back to
                  bed.

     He stomps off to bed.

                               ARCHY
                  Bandy if you ever ask a stupid
                  question like that again, you see
                  Danny there? He's gonna slap you.

                               BANDY
                  Sorry Arch, it's just,...I was trying
                  to use initiative.

                               ARCHY
                  Danny slap him.

     DANNY slaps him with the back of his left hand.       Archy's not
     happy - it was the wrong hand.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  With the right Danny,..properly.

     DANNY slaps him again, it's weak.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  I said properly, with the back of
                  your right hand Danny.

                               DANNY
                  What is this a tennis match Arch?

                               ARCHY
                  Slap him!

     DANNY slaps him again, BANDY takes it good. Archy huffs and
     goes over to slap him proper, SLAP! Bandy's disappeared
     into another dimension.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  Like that!

               Now, if you men can master a slap
               like that, there's no need for your
               clients to hold back. They'll open

               Look, thinks he's back at school.

                              DANNY
               But he never went to school.

                              ARCHY
               Daniel, do you want a slap as well?
               Now, if the slap doesn't work,..Cut
               'em...or pay 'em, but keep the
               receipts 'cos this ain't the Mafia.

31   EXT. BOND WAREHOUSE - BACK LOT - DAY                             31

     Mumbles, Handsome Bob, and One Two are standing here dressed
     as security guards. Handsome Bob is watching over the car
     that is waiting for the TWO ACCOUNTANTS to come out of the
     back door of the warehouse. One Two and Mumbles are to the
     side.

                              MUMBLES
               You ready?

                              ONE TWO
               Yup, load up boys and pay attention.

     One Two see's the door open and makes a move. Two ACCOUNTANTS
     come out of the back door, while in route they click their
     central locking open on the car waiting. One Two is already
     on them as the ACCOUNTANTS go to open their car door.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               Hello lads.

     He flashes the gun in his belt. The ACCOUNTANTS are too
     shocked to even know what is going on.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               Put the bags in the car and walk
               away.

     The ACCOUNTANTS see the gun, but still look for a way out.
     Mumbles meets them with another gun.

     The ACCOUNTANTS do as they are told. One Two and Mumbles
     get into the car, calm as you like. One Two, starts the
     engine, but he can't find reverse. There is a crunching
     sound from the car, the accountants stop and look round.
     One Two puts down the window.

                              ONE TWO
                   (to the accountants)
               Oi, come back here.

     The ACCOUNTANTS come back.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               Where's reverse?

                              ACCOUNTANT
               You have to lift up the nob under
               the gear stick.
     One Two struggles, then finds the gear.

                              ONE TWO
               Right, now fuck off.

                              MUMBLES

               Slowly and keep smiling.

               Oi come back here.
                              MUMBLES
               Why? What did he ever do to you?
               Come on we've got the money now let's

     The Accountant has made his away back to the car.

                              ACCOUNTANT
               Yes?

     One Two goes through the motions getting ready to hit the
     accountant without actually being able to do it.

                              ONE TWO
               Shit, I can't do it.

     He starts to do a slow spin, at which point WE SEE a large
     white stipe running down the furs back.

                             MALCOLM (CONT'D)
               Get an eye full of that stripe
               gentlemen.

               Have a look at that, it's a six foot
               skunk.

     Everyone thinks its very fuckin funny.     The laughter is
     interrupted only by the buzzer.

     Buzzzzzzzzzz, Fred goes to answers the buzzer.

                             MALCOLM
               And all of this could be yours for a
               staggeringly low,...

     Cut to Fred at the buzzer.

                             FRED THE HEAD
               All right Arch.

     Back to the table, everyone's ears prick up at the name.
     Malcolm pauses before he panics, he can tell something is
     up.

                             FRED THE HEAD (CONT'D)
               Yeah, come on up.

     Everyone starts tucking their money into their pockets.
     Fred makes his way back to the table. He speaks to Malcolm
     and Paul.

                             FRED THE HEAD (CONT'D)
               You two out, live-o.
                   (gesturing)
               The back door.

     Malcolm knows this is a sign to go.

                             MALCOLM
               Come on Paul, we'll be going now.

     The two Scotsmen race in their fur coats toward the back
     door. IN WALKS Archy with Danny, the crew continue their
     card game.

     One Two slowly kicks it out from under the table. Archy
     leans over to take the bag and One Two sticks a few notes in
     his pocket.

               And buy yourself a new pair of shoes.

     Uri has got some serious stink boat gin palace on the River
     Thames. He's entertaining Stella.

                              URI
               They say there are only two days you
               enjoy a boat, the day you buy it and
               the day you sell it.

                              STELLA
               Well, according to my figures that
               sounds about right, but what can you
               do?
                   (beat)
               Beauty is a cruel mistress.

     He smiles, she is smart, he fancies her.

                              URI

     He nods.

                Tell me about your husband.

     Slightly uncomfortable

                              STELLA
                My husband is a lawyer.

                I hear he is very good at what he
                does, maybe we can have some work
                for him.

     Pause, she's dead pan and not giving anything away.

                              URI (CONT'D)
                Tell me, what do you do for fun?

     Pause.

                Have I offended you in some way?

                              STELLA
                I don't quite know where this is
                going and if you don't mind, I would
                like to keep our relationship
                professional.

     There is a pause while Uri is slightly lost for words. Then
     he slams the table in excitement and looks up at Victor who
     is standing in the distance.

                              URI
                You see Victor, this is what I am
                talking about.
                    (in Russian)
                This is what I like about this

                you do your job, I do mine and
                everyone gets along.

               for as long as it takes to boil that
               kettle. After that, I am going to
               ask you a question, one question.
               You are going to give me a name and
               if it's the right name, I send you
               home warm and dry in a fresh set of

                             HANDSOME BOB

     Pause. A little look from One Two like "Oh you're taken the
     piss", then a realization that he isn't. The brakes are
     slammed on and the car comes to a screeching halt. One Two
     is out before you know it, screaming through the windshield.

     WE CUT BACK TO TEN YEARS AGO. Cut to a shot of a 12 year
     old BOY with a cut under his eye singing "Bank Robber" by
     The Clash in to the mirror. He's wearing just his boxer
     shorts and enjoying himself, he's gonna be a rock star.
     From behind WE SEE his bedroom door open, but the music is
     to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance. We SEE Lenny,
     ten years younger entering, we can tell via the body language
     that he is irritated. He pauses then walks up suddenly
     slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face.
     It's enough to knock him out, the boy goes down - shot like
     a bullet out of a barrel. The red hand then slaps the stereo
     off.

               You think? It wasn't all bad, he
               sometimes made me laugh too.

               Pedro's dad's a tickling monster!

     Johnny helps himself to some WASTERS drink at the bar for a
     quick refreshment. Understandably, the WASTER doesn't look
     happy and his three FRIENDS don't look happy either.

                             WASTER
               That's my drink.

     Johnny gives the WASTER and his FRIENDS the masturbation
     signal without even bothering to look at them.

                             PETE
               Fuck you singalong, you're no help
               and stop calling me Pedro.

     The WASTER grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some
     action. Johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket, he holds

               Come on boy, I'll have you and ya
               girlfriends! I'll do the lot of
               yazz.

     The WASTER is lost. Johnny is not physically scary, he's
     only scary because he's quite clearly mad. He looks like
     Robert Deniro in Taxi driver, mad as mars, he catches himself
     in the mirror, he likes what he sees. Ciggy falling out of
     his mouth, he sort of takes the piss out of himself, smiles
     "tough Johnny," the WASTER backs off he doesn't want junkie
     madness.

     Johnny sits back down next to Pete.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
               Did your Dad do anything else to you

               to tickle you Pete, I'm not your
               Dad.

     He looks over and see's Pete has got the most horrific scars
     on his back. Johnny notice's them and stops in his tracks.
     Johnny walks back over to Pete and very tenderly touches his
     back, it feels horrible and bobbled.

     He pulls out a ciggy.     Pete takes it.

               I used to think it had something to
               do with Bonanza.

                              JOHNNY STORY
               Your dad was jealous. Cos you dad
               isn't sure he's your dad, cos you
               don't look like him.

                             LENNY COLE
                Well thank you Uri, that's a real
                compliment from a man that obviously
                takes good care of himself.

                             URI
                I suppose you're wondering why you
                are here?

                             LENNY COLE
                I assume you want to check that
                everything is still "kosher" at my
                end.
                     (pause)
                I was a little surprised you didn't
                come through at the appropriate time,
                but I reckon you have your reasons.
     Silence.

                             URI
                I assume everything is still as you
                say,...Kosher?

     Pause. Lenny milks the moment and after a few seconds of
     mock thought, he speaks.

                             LENNY COLE
                Don't you worry Uri, that one's on
                me,...partners and all that, but I
                wouldn't like it to go south again,
                makes things difficult, if you know
                what I mean?

                             URI
                I understand Lenny and I wouldn't
                like things to go wrong either.
                Which brings me conveniently to my
                next point. Ever since the painting,
                my lucky painting, hasn't been hanging
                on my wall, things have not
                been,....so lucky. I know this is a
                rude request because we have not
                concluded our business, but I feel
                as though I need it.

     Long pause while Lenny scrambles for an excuse.

65   INT. LENNY'S CAR                                                 65

     Lenny enters the car looking a little peachy.     Archy takes
     one look and grimaces.

               painting.

     Archy looks a little worried.

                             ARCHY
               Oh, I see. That's a bit of a problem
               then isn't it?

               they changed color, went fuckin red
               they did.

                             ARCHY
               They don't care who's soil they are
               on that lot. They can buy half the
               country without breaking a sweat,
               you're small time to them. They
               could click their fingers and we'd
               be ether.

     Turning very nasty.

                             LENNY COLE
               You speak to me like that again and
               I'll cut your fuckin tongue out. I

               raise a finger, 'cos I'll take off
               his whole fuckin arm. Do you
               understand that Archy?

               I said do YOU?

     Archy thinks his boss is going mad, but he doesn't let on.

               Yes, I do Len.

     The door opens Mumbles, One Two, Cookie, and Fred stand there.
     A man, TOM in black tie opens the door, he looks posh and is
     in his boxers.

                             TOM

               My name is Cookie.

     He offers it to One Two who accepts. Tom pulls it back at          
     the last minute and greases his hair back.

                So you're part of the wild bunch?
                Stella says you're dangerous.

      Mumbles smiles and flicks his cigar ash into Bertie's glass.
      He knows he's a poof and keeps his eyes on him a second too
      long just to get Bertie excited.

                              MUMBLES
                Does she now?

                bunch?

      Bertie is talking about Handsome and Mumbles knows it.

                slinger in town.

      CUT TO One two who has just run into Stella, there is a man
      holding a tray of drinks next to them.

                                  STELLA
                   Drink?

                   Am I a dancer? Shall we put the
                   record straight?

      One Two makes room in front of him and starts to dance
      relativity badly. You get the feeling he probably could
      dance, but he just can't be bothered to make an effort.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   You see it's all in the genes.
                       (he slowly turns)
                   My Dad was a dancer and his Dad before
                   that so gradually it's percolated
                   the old DNA. You not joining me?
                                  STELLA
                   Sure, I like to dance.

      She stands up and dances just like him.

                   at a five stretch, I thought you

                   you look like you might have more

                   to, anyway, you don't have to tell
                   me anything. If he's an informer

      Pete picks up the pack as Johnny keeps his eyes shut. The
      following story is a montage of pack shots of the cigarette
      box, intercut with Johnny's delicate fingers stroking the
      keys.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                You will notice that one of your
                personalities is seduced by the
                illusions of grandeur. A "gold"
                packet of "king" size and with a
                "regal" insignia. An attractive
                implication toward glamour and wealth,
                a subtle suggestion that cigarettes
                are indeed your "royal" and loyal
                friends. And that Pete,...is a lie.
                    (beat)
                Your other personality is trying to
                draw your attention to the flip side
                of the discussion. Written in boring,
                bold, black and white is the
                statement, that these neat little
                soldiers of death, are in fact, trying
                to "kill you." And that Pete,...is
                the truth.
                    (beat)
                Beauty is a beguiling call to death
                and I am addicted to the sweet siren
                of its pitch. And that,..is why,..you
                and I love the crack, and that is
                also why I can not,.. give that
                painting back.

      He opens his eyes and looks at Pete, his cigarette has gone
      out.

                Now, please pass me a light.

                Oh you are something special Johnny
                Story.

      Johnny smiles and puts him in a head lock, they fall to the
      floor wrestling.

     venue. Johnny and Pete hustle their way through the crowd,
     the BOUNCER pulls them up.

     The BOUNCER is holding Johnny and Pete back.

                             BOUNCER
               Run along junkies.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Oi looky, but no touchy.

     Johnny pushes the BOUNCERS arm away. The BOUNCER retorts
     with a slap round the cheek. Pete won't stand for that, he
     goes for the BOUNCER in a pathetic junkie way.

                             PETE
               Get off him you slag, he's class.

     The BOUNCER smashes a big bouncer punch right on Pete's nose.
     Pete shoots back past Johnny and lays in the road, the line
     starts clapping.

     Johnny makes for the BOUNCER with menace, the BOUNCER looks
     at Johnny coming and smiles.

     Johnny   keeps coming, he's tiny in comparison, the BOUNCER
     stands   and waits - he's ready. Johnny gives the old two

     swings   into the ether

     We SEE inside the Range Rover where there is a DRIVER with
     our TWO CHECHNYANS. The CHECHNYANS have suitcases handcuffed
     to their wrists. They speak in their native tongue.

               Victor is Uri's right hand man, we
               served together for four years in

               time together, he's a real soldier,
               strong, hard, we made much trouble.
               I saved his life and he saved mine
               many times,...

     CHECHNYAN 1 pulls up his sleeve to reveal a massive tattoo.
     His arm is filled with slash marks on it.

     CHECHNYAN 2 pulls up his trouser leg to reveal massive scars
     on his shin.

      Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway
      car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their
      car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are
      carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly
      opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the
      window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans
      in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's
      wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles
      uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.

                              MUMBLES
                There's another case, grab it.

      One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.
      As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the
      car by CHECHNYAN 2.

                              ONE TWO
                The bastard's still kicking.     Mace
                him, mace him!

      Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays
      mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot,
                the Guerrilla!

      CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength
      and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can
      SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car
      looking concerned.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards
                going to eat me!
      Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and
      fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the
      CHECHNYAN.

      One Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to
      reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and
      Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing.

                                  MUMBLES
                   Let's go, we've got it.

                   Give me a hand, you've blinded me!
      Major confusion is setting in. They run back to their car,
      which is still running, Mumbles shoves One Two into the back
      and jumps in the drivers seat.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   Go, go, go, go!!!!!!

      With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation
      and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very
      large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles
      in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting
      go.

      The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that
      has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious
      ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting
      go.

                   Give me the gun.

      One Two can get a clear shot into the CHECHNYAN 2's side.
      He shots him once, CHECHNYAN 2 doesn't move, twice, three
      times, four times, he finally lets go and falls down on the
      floor.

               Grab my hand, we're getting out of
               here.

                             ONE TWO
               Who's got the cases?

                             MUMBLES
               I've got 'em.

     As they get out of the car, WE SEE CHECHNYAN 1 has now made
     his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his
     eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. The
     boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1
     is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He
     lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who
     all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips
     into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his
     opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to
     him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his
     head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a
     new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two
     is attached to his arm.

                             ONE TWO
               Shoot him Mumbles or we won't get
               out of this!

                             MUMBLES
               I can't fuckin shoot him, you do it.

     A baseball smashes into Mumbles face, he goes down, and he's
     out. CHECHNYAN 2 has appeared carrying a metal baseball
     bat. One Two picks up the machine gun.

                             ONE TWO
               Stop or I'll shoot!

     CHECHNYAN 2 will not stop, he just keeps on coming.

                             ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               I mean it, get down,...get down!

     CHECHNYAN 2 keeps coming, One Two doesn't want to do it but
     he has to. He lets off twenty three bullets into the
     CHECHNYAN 2's chest, the CHECHNYAN is knocked back and
     disappears over the mezzanine. One Two is in shock, he has
     never killed a man. He stands there numb.

     They make their way to the entrance. There is a crowd of
     PEOPLE gathered, a great "ohhhhhhhh" goes up.

                              ONE TWO
               Where's Bob?

     Beep. Beep. A car slowly makes it way through the crowd.
     It pulls up and the boys pile in, what's left of them. They
     pull away from the sports shop.

95   INT. BOB'S GETAWAY CAR                                          95

     Bob looks in his mirror, he can see a gun being raised, there
     is someone on the trunk.

                              HANDSOME BOB
               Down.

     He slams on the brakes. CHECHNYAN 2 goes flying over the
     roof, but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the
     hood with his massive knife. He proceeds to perforate the
     wind screen with another knife that he extracts and (because
     of laminate) starts to saw through the wind screen. The
     boys are in horror.

                              HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D)
               Abandon ship!

96   EXT. BOB'S GETAWAY CAR                                          96

     One Two gets caught in a head lock by CHECHNYAN 2, they
     struggle. Mumbles hits the CHECHNYAN from behind with a car
     Jack and CHECHNYAN 2 goes down again. One Two's eyes have
     just about come back.
                              ONE TWO
               Run!     Run for your lives.

     The crew split in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Bob takes the cases
     and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes
     off. Mumbles disappears another way. CHECHNYAN 2 is up and
     follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins.
     One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over
     a wall.

     One Two has ended up on a railway track. He turns back, why
     should CHECHNYAN 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. But
     no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping
     in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength
     this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down
     the tracks.

     The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a
     pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes
     on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can
     see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
     sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
     starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
     is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
     eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
     remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
     almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
     him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.

     One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
     a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
     machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
     One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
     moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
     moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
     moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
     can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit."
     This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts
     in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
     runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.

98   EXT. STREET                                                        98

     We see Mumbles has caught up with One Two along side the
     tracks. He is on a motorbike that he has stolen.

                               MUMBLES
                  Get on!

     One Two jumps on the back and they speed away leaving our
     Chechnyan's behind.

                   I can't do it, you've left it too
                   long Lenny. You want something that
                   the city has a ruling against,
                   something they said they wouldn't
                   give permission to build.

                   they'd never build, how did that
                   happen eh? Fuckin termites got
                   together and had a house building
                   party did they? No sunshine, back

                   This isn't fuckin Zaire Lenny, I
                   can't do it this time.

      Lenny grabs the Councilor by the bollocks and pushes him up

      Victor has extracted a five iron from out of the golf bag
      and has decided to break both of Lenny's legs in ten different
      places. Lenny screams in unimaginable agony, writhing on
      the green. Uri almost ignores the activity.

      One Two comes in and closes the door behind him.

      He looks down on the floor and there is THE PAINTING, we see
      a large note on it that says.

      "Let myself in, thought your lady would like the painting.
      Love, Cookie"

      The door bell rings, he opens it and there stands Stella.
      She walks in straight past One Two, he turns round with his
      mouth open, she gently slaps it shut and kisses him.

      One Two is sitting on the bed that has been torn apart.
      He's in his boxer shorts with a ciggy in his mouth. Stella
      is walking toward the bathroom, the phone rings.

      Lenny is clearly distressed, his confidence has gone.

                I need that picture Archy, I need it

      Leant up against the wall is the lucky painting, she stops
      and looks at it, the camera slowly creeps into her face. We

      TV, more silly cartoons. He's got his top off and he's
      smoking a ciggy. His feet are resting on an old chair and
      Pete is asleep next to him. Johnny hardly moves.

      pulls the trigger.

      It's a lighter. He relights his splif, hot hash dropping on

                                 VICTOR
                Uri is a man born with nothing, carved
                his way up the hard way, he's smart,
                young and only one thing will stop
                him from reaching his goals,...women.
                And this woman has become a problem.
                    (pause)
                My job is to protect Uri and in this
                department he needs protecting, I
                don't like her or trust her and I
                want you to follow that snake.

      We reveal it's CHECHNYAN 1 our war criminal who is looking
      battered from the beating the day before.

                                 CHECHNYAN 1
                Leave it with me Victor.

122   EXT. RESTAURANT       - FLASH BACK                              122

      We go back to the scene at the restaurant from a different
      perspective. The two CHECHNYAN'S see One Two and Handsome
      Bob walk out of the restaurant, they two look at one another,
      their brows steel.

123   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            123

      CUT BACK to present with the music being cut off from One
      Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a
      very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered
      the room and pulled the wire out of the machine. CHECHNYAN
      1 is sitting on a chair next to One Two, he's the one with
      the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.

124   EXT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            124

      Archy approaches the door with Danny behind, he pushes it,
      it opens. Concerned, he pulls out a shooter, so does Danny,
      they go in.

125   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            125

      The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make
      their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.
      The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he
      pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we
      reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little
      amused.

      Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head
      is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle
      of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles
      uselessly.

      On the floor facing the other direction is our pretty much
      naked Chechnyan doing a traditional Chechnyan dance, which
      involves lots of extended leg action.

      He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from
      his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive
      frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two
      previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly
      dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all
      sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by
      the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.
      He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking
      distressed. Silence ensues.

                              ARCHY
                Is this a bad time One Two?

                              ONE TWO
                    (unable to say anything)
                Emmm, emmmmmmmmmmmm.

                     anything)
                Emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

      The Chechnyans make a quick move, their last ever.        We hear
      FOUR shots ring out quickly.

126   EXT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                                126

      Handsome Bob and Mumbles pull up and get out. Handsome Bob
      puts the paper work in his top pocket and bangs on the front
      door.

127   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                                127

      One Two is being wrapped up in a carpet on the floor. He's
      still emmmmmmmmming and wriggling. We hear Handsome Bob and
      Mumbles at the front.
                              MUMBLES (V.O.)
                One Two, it's us.

      Archy pays no attention to the door yet, he is on the phone
      to Lenny.

                              LENNY COLE (V.O.)

      Roman and Mickey are still here with Johnny.    Roman speaks.

                Archy?

129   EXT. ETON POSH SCHOOL - WE FLASHBACK TEN YEARS                  129

      Archy leans against a ROLLSROYCE with another HEAVY. Young
      Johnny walks up, he's wearing tales and a bow tie, he's with
      two of his toffy school FRIENDS.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Hello Archy.
                               ARCHY
                Johnny, you do look the part.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Show us your guns Uncle Arch, I told
                the boys all about it.

                               ARCHY
                Shut up and get in the car.

      Archy throws Johnny a packet of rolos and turns to get in
      the car. As he turns, Johnny lifts up the back of his sports
      jacket and steals his gun. The two FRIENDS are in shock,
      needless to say so is Archy. Johnny holds it on his two
      friends.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Give us your money boys.
      Archy grabs the gun and hits Johnny on the back of the head,
      not too hard.

                               ARCHY
                You little swine,... now get in the
                car.

      Archy puts the gun away and looks at the two shocked school
      friends. He gently slaps them on the cheek in an intimidating
      way and gives them a tener.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                Be good boys, you never know who's
                watching.

      Lenny's in a wheelchair, he looks at Bandy.

                               LENNY COLE
                   Come here Bandy.

      Bandy comes near, Lenny takes a sniff.

      Archy arrives with a couple of old carpets, One Two, Mumbles
      and Handsome Bob are wrapped inside.

      Archy turns and slaps him the famous "Archy slap" it's nasty,
      Archy's getting wound up.

                              ARCHY
                Shut it, otherwise you will get hurt.

      His face has been slapped into the direction of Roman and
      Mickey. Johnny keeps his head still,...

                              JOHNNY STORY
                That, Roman and Mickey, is the famous
                Archy slap. I have been magically
                transported straight back to my
                childhood.

      He speaks next in a little boys voice, he's taking the piss.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                Don't turn Archy in, he's your friend,
                he's loyal, just like the dog.

      He changes to impersonate Lenny, its deep and over the top.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                Shut up boy, don't stick your nose
                where it don't belong otherwise I'll
                chop it off.
                    (little boy voice)
                But you can't do it to Uncle Arch, I
                love him.
                    (deep)
                Needs a little lesson though don't
                he? Left his station hasn't he? A
                little time inside to remember who
                the boss is.

      Archy straightens his tie to remain calm, but can't take it
      any longer. He picks Johnny up and slams him against the
      wall.
                              ARCHY
                    (shouting)
                Shut it, you hear me or I'll do ya

      The elevator door opens and we see skinny Johnny stuck up in
      the air held by Archy. Danny looks on a bit disturbed.

                   Put him down Arch, he's only little.

      Archy drops him, his wires crossed.        He needs a little time
      to think.

      Johnny is off out of the elevator walking away happy as a
      clam. Back to Archy in the elevator.

                                DANNY (CONT'D)
                   You all right?     You look a little
                   green.

      Johnny comes bowling in like a 'rocknrolla' coming on to
      stage. He spots Lenny.

                                JOHNNY STORY
                   Sidney!   Nice wheels.

      Archy comes in with Danny and the carpets, Handsome Bob hears
      this, is Lenny Cole the Sidney Shaw?

                                JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   Sorry about the painting, needed the
                   cash for a little bit of the old
                   "dusty show bizzzzzzzz."
                       (beat)
                   So, it's gone now, lost in the world
                   of degenerate and stoned no hopers,
                   never to be seen again by the eye of
                   a clean soul.

      There is a pause while Lenny considers just shooting him.
      He changes his tone, he gets serious and slow.

                                LENNY COLE
                   Tell me, what are you boy if you are
                   not poison? Look what you've left
                   behind you. Your Dad couldn't even
                   bear the sight ya, no wonder he fucked
                   off and left me to pick up the pieces,
                   but that wasn't enough for you was
                   it? No, had to drive your mum into
                   a bottle of pills and house full of
                   nutters. All she got then was a hot

                   Archy get him out of here.

                                 ARCHY
                   I've had enough of him, I don't trust

                   Use someone else.

      Johnny grabs the back of Lenny's chair and pushes him around
      like he's a two year old, Lenny feels a right twit. One
      Two, Handsome Bob, and Mumbles observe.

                                 JOHNNY STORY
                   It's a gathering, I love a gathering

                   It's all going so well apart from
                   Archy who's ruining the day. I tried
                   to cheer him up with that story about
                   how you grassed him u,...

      BANG! Lenny shoots Johnny in the hip with a gun he has kept
      hidden. Everybody is shocked, Danny jumps back in horror
      that was pretty close.

                                 ROMAN
                   Whooooa,...

                   All right calm down, give me that,
                   I'll take care of him.

      Danny moves in to take the gun from Lenny.    Johnny speaks in
      pain, but still chipper.

                                 JOHNNY STORY
                   That wasn't one of your better shots
                   was it now Daddy. If you want to
                   shut me up it should have been a bit
                   higher.

      Lenny looks up to Danny.

                The address is in my top pocket.
                Here, Archy,...you know I wouldn't
                mess you around.

      Lenny is out of reach of them, Archy can tell Handsome Bob
      is implying something.

                              HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D)
                Take it Arch.

      himself over.

                              LENNY COLE
                Let me have a look first.

      He takes the letters out of Handsome Bob's top pocket and
      opens them up. He squints, the print is too small he can't
      read what it says.

                              ARCHY
                Here you can't read it without your
                glasses, let me have a look.

      Lenny looks uncomfortable, Archy almost snatches the letters
      and flicks through the pages. He reads to himself, could it
      be true? Could Lenny be the informer sending everyone around
      him down?

      Archy turns the pages of the letter. WE SEE different JUDGES
      giving different sentences to different FACES, some of these
      faces we know, one of them is Fred the Head, Handsome Bob
      and one of them is ARCHY.

                The only evidence that will ever
                remain of this deal is that form of
                a very exclusive and hard to come by
                legal document called a "secret
                debt"...

                Of course they use a false name and
                I have seen that name many times in
                the last twenty years, always did
                wonder who Sidney Shaw was,...

145   INT. LENNYS OFFICE - FLASHBACK                                   145

      FLASHBACK twenty years ago, Archy picking up papers on Lenny's
      desk and turns to him.

                   You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a
                   very dirty bastard.

      Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims,
      he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth
      into Lenny's wide open mouth.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)

                   out of here,...

      Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it
      and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back
      on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny
      has grassed on over the years.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                   Michael Finny, ten years. Frazier

                   Michael Dexter, eight years.

      Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish
      death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair. He
      presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with
      haste.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)

149   INT. TRUNK OF STOLEN CAR - FLASH FORWARD                       149

      We see six gallons of petrol in the trunk of the car in our
      imaginary scene.

                              JOHNNY
                And pour six gallons of petrol on
                top, I can let your imagination fill
                in the rest.

      Back to present.

                              JOHNNY
                But now Danny's rattled, he won't be
                able to wait because you now know
                what's coming, so he's gonna fire.

      Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted
      everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.
      Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,
      and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the
      wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's
      head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets
      a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,
      speaks coolly.

                              JOHNNY STORY
                Mickey, pass me the gun.

      Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding.
                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                MICKEY quickly, pass me that gun in
                Dannys hand. Don't worry he can't
                defend himself he doesn't have a
                head, quickly now. Does this answer
                the question that you two so
                frequently asked as to why I sought
                refuge in the depths and perverse
                beauty of the crack pipe?

      The elevator door opens.

                   Get fucking down!

      He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny. Just as
      he's about to fire,..there is a great smash of bone on timber.
      Bandy falls to reveal One Two standing there with a large
      piece of timber.

                               ONE TWO
                   I think we should get out of here
                   now, don't you John?

      At which point in the background WE SEE Lenny being lowered
      to his demise. He looks at the group in horror as he is
      quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish.
      FADE OUT.

                   I don't like it Uri, I don't trust
                   her. I put two of my people on her
                   and they haven't come back.

      Very insulted.

                               URI
                   You what? I did not tell you to do
                   this. If I had wanted her spied on
                   I would have asked for it, wouldn't
                   I?

                               VICTOR
                   Yes Uri, you would have, but I still
                   don't like it.

                               URI
                   I don't care what you like Victor, I

                       (pause)

                   I would like to ask you something
                   personal.

      His phone rings, he frowns slightly and answers it.

                               URI (CONT'D)
                   Not now Victor, I am busy.

      Uri turns. There, casually resting on the floor is his
      painting, his lucky painting. Uri's expression changes, his
      world has been shattered, he's thinking very ugly thoughts.
      He turns back to Stella, dead pan.

                               URI (CONT'D)
                   A very nice painting. How long have
                   you had it?

      A little caught off guard.

                               STELLA
                   Years, it's my lucky painting,...
                   it's very special isn't it?

                               URI
                   Beauty is a cruel mistress, is it
                   not?

      Pause, she smiles. Uri talks back into the phone, the other
      darker Uri is now in charge.

                               URI (CONT'D)
                   Victor please, come to join us.

					CHORUS (Cont)
			To the late night double feature

	The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO 
	WIDE-SCREEN.  The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton 
	Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds 
	from the church organ.

	The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a 
	crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting 
	excitedly.

	The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.

	PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.

	BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-
	twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH.  BRAD and RALPH shake 
	hands.

					RALPH
			Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!

					BRAD
			Well I don't think there was any doubt
			about that - You and Betty have been
			almost inseparable ever since you sat
			in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.

					RALPH
			Tell you the truth Brad, she was the
			only reason I came in the first place.
			Science was never one of my favourite
			subjects but I sure with Dr Scott
			could have made it today.

					BRAD
			Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
			We drove over to see him last vacation.
			It's a shame his new job took him away
			from Denton.

	BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.

	JANET catches it.  She squeals with delight.

	The GUESTS cheer.

					RALPH
			Hey fella.  It looks like it could be
			your turn next.

					BRAD
			Who knows...ha ha.

	RALPH & BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great 
	enthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.

	JANET & BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An 
	old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the 
	Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.

	The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church 
	doors.  Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the 
	MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we 
	shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.

					JANET (who is holding the bouquet)
			Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
			Betty look radiantly beautiful.  
			Just an hour ago she was plain old
			Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs. 
			Ralph Hapschatt.

					BRAD (Still looking after the car)
			Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a 
			lucky guy.  (They start to move d.s.)

					JANET
			Yes.

					BRAD
			Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful 
			little cook.

					JANET
			Yes.

					BRAD
			And Ralph himself will be in line for 
			promotion in a year or so.

					JANET
			Yes.

			I've got something to say.

					JANET
			Uh huh.

					BRAD
			I really loved the skilful way
			You beat the other girls

			There's a fire in my heart
			And you fan it.  (Jumps off)

			Dammit, Janet.

	He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds 
	to wipe off.

					BRAD
			I love you.

	JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.

					BRAD
			Here's a ring to prove that
			I'm not joker.

	CHURCH BELLS Peal out.  RIFF & MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the 
	church, door closes behind them.

					BRAD
			There's three ways that love can grow.
			That's good bad or mediocre.

	JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.  She throws down the bouquet and 
	would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it 
	again.

					BRAD
			Oh - J - A - N - E - T
			I love you so.

	JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.

17	INT. CHURCH		DAY

	JANET bursts into the church, hypnotised by the ring.  BRAD follows her.

					JANET
			Oh!......It's nicer than
			Betty Munroe had

					MAGENTA (Peering up from behind pew)
			Oh Brad.

					JANET
			Now we're engaged and I'm so glad.

					MAGENTA & COLUMBIA
			Oh Brad.  (Both peer up and disappear)

					JANET
			That you met Mom
			And you know Dad.

					WHOLE FAMILY
			Oh Brad.  (peering up together)

					JANET (Taking his arm)
			I've one thing to say
			And that's, Brad
			I'm mad,
			For you too.

	BRAD & JANET start to walk d.s., arm in arm.

					JANET (Laying head on Brad's sh.)
			Oh, Brad.

			Oh Dammit.

					JANET (Caresses his cheek)
			I'm mad.....

					BRAD
			Oh Janet

					JANET
			For you.

					BRAD (briefly kisses her)
			I love you too-oo-oo.

	BRAD takes JANET's hands, turning to her.  We are aware of THE FAMILY 
	bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door.

					BRAD & JANET
			There's one thing left to do-ah-ooh

18	INT.	A STUDY	NIGHT

	Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.  A 
	well-padded armchair has its back to the camera.  It swings around 
	revealing the NARRATOR.  He is in his smoking jacket.  He speaks 
	directly to us.

					NARRATOR
			I would like if I may to take you on a
			strange journey.

	He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title: 
	"The Denton Affair".  He returns to his desk and places it on a 
	bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses.

					NARRATOR
			It seemed a fairly ordinary night when
			Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss
			(two young ordinary healthy kids) left
			Denton that late November evening to
			visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and
			now friend of both of them.  It's true 
			there were dark storm clouds, heavy, 
			black and pendulous, toward which they 
			were driving.  It's true also that the 
			spare tyre they were carrying was badly 
			in need of some air.  But they being 
			normal kids and on a night out, well 
			they were not going to let a storm 
			spoil the events of their evening.

			On a night out.

	He closes the book marking the place.

	Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.

					NARRATOR
			It was a night out they were going to
			remember for a very long time.

	Lighting cracks on the sound track.

	Shadow.

	A motorcycle roars past them.

					JANET
			Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist
			that's passed us.  They certainly take
			their lives in their hands.  What with
			the weather and all.

					BRAD
			Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to
			that type.

	JANET takes another stick of gum.

	Offers BRAD some.  He declines.

	The car slows to a halt.

					JANET
			What's the matter Brad, darling?

	Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".

					BRAD
			I think we took the wrong fork a few

			Didn't we pass a castle back down the

	He unbuckles his seatbelt.

					JANET
			I'm coming with you.

					BRAD
			There's no point both of us getting wet.

	She sing plaintively.

					JANET
			In the velvet darkness
			Of the blackest night
			Burning bright.

	We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up 
	with him.

	Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.

					JANET
			There's a guiding star
			No matter what or who you are.

	They have passed a row of trees.  A rock formation in the shape of a 
	castle is silhouetted against the sky.  It has a flag flying from the 
	turret.

	Lightning strikes.

	A glow of light appears in a window.  It illuminates a path to the 
	castle.

	BRAD and JANET turn.

	The castle is in the distance between the two of them.

					BRAD & JANET
			There's a light

	The castle looms in the distance.

			There's a light, a light

	Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.

					BRAD
			I can see the flag fly
			I can see the rain
			Just the same
			There has got to be
			Something better here
			For you and me.

			Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold

					BRAD
			Just a moment, Janet.  They may have
			a telephone.

	The door opens.  Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there 
	is a party going on in the distance.

	The figure we have seen at the window emerges.  He is a hunch-backed 
	servant, RIFF RAFF.

					RIFF RAFF
			Hello.

					BRAD
			Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors.
			And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I -
			ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our
			car has broken down about two miles up the

39	INT.	HALLWAY	NIGHT

	They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs.  Another servant,
	MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to RIFF RAFF is 
	vacuuming the stairs.

					RIFF RAFF
			This way.

	JANET steps over the vacuum lead.

					JANET
			Are you - giving a party?

					RIFF RAFF
			No.  You've arrived on a rather special
			night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

					JANET
			Oh, lucky him.

					MAGENTA
			He's lucky.

	BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.

					MAGENTA
			You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all
			lucky.

40	SONG:		"THE TIME WARP"

	BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.  
	They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors 
	reflecting to infinity.

					RIFF RAFF
			It's astounding
			Time is fleeting
			Madness takes its toll
			But listen closely
			Not for very much longer
			I've got to keep control.

	MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.

	RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.

					RIFF RAFF
			I remember doing the Time Warp.

	BRAD and JANET are amazed.

					RIFF RAFF
			Drinking those moments when
			The blackness would hit me.

	MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.

	JANET clings to BRAD.

					RIFF RAFF
			And the void would be calling.

	RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM.

41	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver
	ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding 
	it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are 
	the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the 
	Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from 
	all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - 
	announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are
	all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted 
	version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, 
	they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.

					GUESTS
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	JANET falls into BRAD's arms.

	RIFF RAFF is ecstatic.

			So you can't see me
			No not at all.

	BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm.

			With voyeuristic intention.

	BRAD blushes.

			Well secluded I see all
			With a bit of a mind flip
			You're into the time slip
			Nothing will ever seem the same.

	They are back at the balcony.

			You're spaced out on sensation.

	They are at the edge of the balcony.

			Like you're under sedation.

	They force BRAD and JANET into the Ballroom proper.

			Don't judge a book by its cover
			I'm not much of a man
			By the light of day
			But by night I'm one hell of a lover.

	JANET gives a silent scream.

	transvestite attire.

	The GUESTS scream with delight.

					FRANK
			I'm just a sweet Transvestite

	He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.

			Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
			You look like you're both pretty groovie.

	He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom.

			Or if you want something visual
			not too abysmal
			We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.

	BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK.  FRANK meanwhile ignores 
	him and greets his other guests.

					BRAD
			I'm glad we caught you at home
			Ah - could we use your phone
			We're both in a bit of a hurry.

	JANET joins BRAD.

					JANET
			Right!

	On the last chord the lift has disappeared.

	The GUESTS applaud ecstatically.

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA close in on BRAD and JANET.  They remove BRAD and
	JANET's wet clothes.

	COLUMBIA moves down from the bandstand and crosses to BRAD and JANET.  
	She witnesses the undressing.

					COLUMBIA
			Slowly, slowly.  It's too nice a job
			to rush.

	The GUESTS moan softly as each piece of clothing is removed.

	BRAD and JANET stand shivering in their underwear.

	There is complete silence.

	The GUESTS and SERVANTS are motionless.

	BRAD and JANET are the total object of their attention.

					JANET
			Oh Brad.

					BRAD
				(confidentially)
			It's alright Janet, we'll play along

	He turns to COLUMBIA who has been staring at his underpants.

					BRAD
			Ah, hi.  My name is Brad Majors and
			this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  You
			are ...

					COLUMBIA
			You are very lucky to be invited up
			to Frank's laboratory.  Some people
			would give their right arm for the
			privilege.

	RIFF RAFF has opened the cage doors to the lift.

	The GUESTS rush for positions.

					BRAD
			People like you maybe

					COLUMBIA
			I've seen it.

	COLUMBIA escorts them to the lift.

	RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them.
	He slams the cage door.

	The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves 
	off under RIFF RAFF's control.

	BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side.

	They stare straight ahead.

					JANET
				(to Magenta)
			It he - Frank - is he your husband?

	General amusement.

					RIFF RAFF
			The Master is not yet married.  Nor
			do I think he ever will be.  We are
			simply his servants.

					JANET
			Oh.

	The lift grinds to a halt.

	They have arrived at the laboratory.

								CUT TO

69	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating 
	theatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the 
	lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which
	though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of 
	ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised 
	dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the 
	operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier 
	hangs above the tank.

	On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone.  
	Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse.
	These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.

	The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.

	FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF 
	RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he
	hands to FRANK.

					FRANK
			Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.

	As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.  They
	cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

					FRANK
			I will entertain...ah...

	BRAD & JANET step out of the lift.

					BRAD
			I'm Brad Majors and this
			is my fiancee, Janet Vice.

					JANET
			Weiss.

					BRAD
			Weiss.

					FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss)
			Encante....How nice.  (he circles them)
			And what charming underclothes you both have.
			(He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff 
			and hands them to Brad).
			But here, put these on.  They'll
			make you feel less vulnerable.

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium.

					FRANK (continues)
			It's not often we receive visitors here.
			Let alone offer them hospitality.

					BRAD (Moving towards Frank)
			Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was 
			use your telephone.  A reasonable request 
			which you have chosen to ignore.

					JANET (Hurring after Brad)
			Don't be ungrateful Brad.

					BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank)
			Ungrateful!

	The room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction.  
	A smile breaks on his face.

					FRANK
			How forceful you are Brad.  Such a 
			perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant.

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh.

			You must be awfully proud of him Janet.

					JANET
			Well, yes I am.

	THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.

					FRANK
			Do you have any tattoos Brad.

					BRAD
			Certainly not!

					FRANK
			Oh well.  How about you.  (He laughs)

	RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.

					RIFF RAFF
			Everything is in readiness, Master.
			We merely await your word.

	FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass.  RIFF 
	RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium

					FRANK
			Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear 
			me at the back?
			Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.

	MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.

					FRANK
			Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough 
			in biochemical research.

	There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.

					FRANK
			And paradise is to be mine.

	GUESTS and everybody applaud.  JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that 
	she shouldn't.

					FRANK
			It was strange the way it happened.
			One of those quirks of fate really.  
			One of those moments when you seem 
			irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're 
			trapped; your back's against the wall.
			There's no way out, and then suddenly, 
			you get a break.  (He cracks the bones 
			in his hand)  All the pieces seem to 
			fit into place.  What a sucker you'r 
			been. What a fool.  The answer was there
			all the time.  It took a small accident 
			to make it happen.  An accident!

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.

					MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly)
			An accident.

					FRANK
			That's how I discovered the secret.
			That elusive ingredient, that spark 
			that is the breath of life.

	GUESTS applaud.

					FRANK (Moving to tank)
			You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate.
			For tonight is the night that my beautiful
			creature is destined to be born.

	Everybody applauds.  FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank.  RIFF 
	RAFF is at the control panel.

70	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	The tank is revealed.  There is something inside it is immersed in clear 
	fluid.  The GUESTS are astonished.

					FRANK
			Throw open the switches on the sonic 
			oscillator.

	RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.

					FRANK
			And step up the reactor power input 
			three more points.

	RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.

	FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is 
	lowered.  It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.

	The liquids bubble and change colour.  The thing inside begins to look 
	like a human form.

					JANET
			Brad...

					BRAD
			It's alright Janet.

	The liquids drain away.  The form begins to move.

	FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.

	ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both 
	arms outstretched.

	RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head.  ROCKY looks at RIFF 
	RAFF then at FRANK.  With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.

	At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle.  He 
	winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.

71	INT.	THE LABORATORY	NIGHT

	SONG:		THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.

	ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the 
	chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.

					ROCKY
			The Sword of Damocles is
			Hanging over my head.

	FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the 
	chandelier.  FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming 
	down.  MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the tank.

					ROCKY
			And I've got the feeling
			Someone's going to be
			Cutting the thread.

			Oh, woe is me.
			My life is a misery.

			Oh, can't you see
			That I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer....

	As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the 
	tank....because...

	ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and 
	COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip
	his arm and leg bandages.

					ROCKY
			I woke up this morning
			With a start
			When I fell out of bed.

					GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			And left from my dreaming
			Was a feeling
			Of un-nameable dread.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime

					ROCKY
			My high is low.
			I'm dressed up
			With no place to go.

			And all I know
			Is I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer.

	FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck.  
	ROCKY spins away.  MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest
	bandage so that it undoes as he goes.

					GUESTS (inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA)
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			Oh, no no, no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no, no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime -
			That ain't no crime.

	ROCKY is now unbandaged.  He strikes a pose.

	During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S 
	shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall.

72	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	NARRATOR reading from book.

					NARRATOR
			Rocky needed peace of mind.
			He didn't know
			He was doing just fine.

			He was the product
			Of another time.
			And as for feeling down -
			Well that's not a crime.

73	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall.

	ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS.

					GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To first group of guests)
			The sword of Damocles is
			Hanging over my head.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To second group)
			And I've got the feeling
			Someone's going to be
			Cutting the thread.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To third group)
			Oh, woe is me - 
			My life is a mystery.

			(To fourth group)
			Oh can't you see
			That I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer.

	ROCKY set off at a run as FRANK looms up again.

	(FRANK is chasing ROCKY round the lab.)

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			Oh no no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime -
			That ain't no crime.

	At the end of number, ROCKY has climbed up the ladder attached to the 
	end of the tank nearest the bridal chambers and FRANK is in a heap 
	below.  RIFF RAFF is behind the tank and MAGENTA and COLUMBIA in their 
	positions in front of it.

74	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	FRANK picks himself up.  ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above 
	him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.

					FRANK
			Well.  That's no way to
			behave on your first day out.

	ROCKY looks hurt.

			But as you're such an
			exceptional beauty I'm
			prepared to forgive.

	FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

			I just love success.

					RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank)
			He is a credit to your
			genius, Master.

					FRANK
			Yes.

					MAGENTA (Moving to tank from controls)
			A triumph of your vill.

					FRANK
			Yes.

					COLUMBIA (Who is on opposite side of tank)
			He's o.k.

					FRANK
			O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards 
			Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a 
			little better than that.

			You.  (To Janet)  What do you think?

					JANET
			Well.  (She looks at Brad)  I don't 
			like men with...er, with too many, muscles.

					FRANK
			I didn't make him for you

	JANET nods hastily.  FRANK moves towards microphone.

			He carries the Charles Atlas seal of 
			approval....And he didn't even take 
			the lessons.

74A	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	SONG:		CHARLES ATLAS (Pt. 1)

	As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's 
	presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium.
	COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.

					FRANK
			A weakling weighing
			Ninety eight pounds
			Will get sand in his face
			When kicked to the ground.
			And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse)
			With a determined chin
			The sweat from his pores
			As he works for his ca-ha-hause

	MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF now bring the weights.

					FRANK
			Will make him glisten - thank you -
			And gleam.
			And with massage
			And just a little bit of
			Ste-he-he-he-hem...(laughs)
			He'll be pink.
			And quite clean.

					FRANK
			He'll be a strong man -
			Oh honey -

					GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK.
			But the wrong man.

					FRANK
			He'll eat nutritious high protein
			And swallow raw eggs.
			Try to build up his shoulders,
			His chest, arms and legs.

			Such an effort -
			If he only knew of my plan.
			In just seven days,

					GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK
			I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an

	ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups.

					FRANK
			He'll do press-ups and chin-ups,
			Do the snatch, clean and jerk.

	FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD

			He thinks dynamic tension
			Must be hard work.
			Such strenuous living
			I just don't understand.

	FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up.

			When, in just seven days -
			Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.)

			I can make you
			A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh).

75	INT.	LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR	NIGHT

	The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a 
	drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles.
	Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, 
	ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar.

	Several guests are crushed to death.

					COLUMBIA
			Eddie!

					EDDIE
			Stay cool baby.

					JANET
			Who's Eddie?

					RIFF RAFF
			The delivery boy.

					MAGENTA
			His delivery wasn't good enough though.

	ROCKY looks terrified.

	JANET has fainted yet again.

	EDDIE comes to life.

76	SONG:		"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT"

					EDDIE
			Whatever happened to Saturday night
			When you dressed up sharp
			And you felt alright
			It don't seem the same since cosmic light
			Came into my life and I thought I was divine.

	COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat.

			I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
			And listen to the music on the radio.

	The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well.

			A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show
			And we climbed in the back
			And we really had a good time

	COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the 
	lights above the stairs start changing colour.

	The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase.

	COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE.

	Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out.

					ALL
			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul
			I really love that rock and roll
			(four times)

	EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs 
	apart guitar strumming pose.

	FRANK is getting furious.

	ROCKY is perplexed.

					EDDIE
			My head used to swim
			From the perfume I smelled.
			My hands kind of fumbled
			With her white plastic belt.
			I'd taster her baby pink lipstick,
			And that's when I'd melt.
			And she'd whisper in my ear,
			Tonight she really was mine.

			Get back in front and put
			Some hair oil on.
			Buddy Holly was singing
			His very last song.
			With your arms around your girl
			You tried to - ah - sing along
			It felt pretty good, whoo.
			Really had a good ti-i-ime.

	EDDIE slips onto the pedal starting the bike.  He takes off and roars 
	round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.

					ALL
			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			You know I love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

	4 bars instrumental (saxophone)

	FRANK steals towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick, 
	innocently.

					ALL			EDDIE
			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE -
			Bless my soul.		BLESS MY SO-O-OUL.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE

			I really love that rock and roll.
							THAT ROCK AND ROO-AHOUL!

	On the last chorus FRANK rushes to EDDIE with the ice pick, in a 
	demented fury.

	THE GUESTS are unbelieving.

	COLUMBIA covers her face with her hands.

	EDDIE is dead.  FRANK walks away from his body unconcerned.

	JANET screams and screams.

			And so perish all those who reject my love!

	ROCKY cowers in terror.

			Oh no, my little Adonis -
			You're much too beautiful to be destroyed.
			He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle.

	ROCKY flexes.

	FRANK is thrilled.

			However, the sudden departure of their

			A feeling which grew as the other guests

			It's only me, Janet.

			Oh, Brad, come in, darling.

			Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling -

			It's alright Janet.  Everything's going

			Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me

			No, don't do that.

			Oh don't be so shy.

	She switches on the light to reveal FRANK.

					JANET
			YOU!

	FRANK sits up.

					FRANK
			I'm afraid so, Janet.  But isn't it nice?

	JANET beats his chest with her clenched fists.

					JANET
			You beast, you monster, what have you

					FRANK
			Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?

					JANET
			You tricked me - I wouldn't have -
			I've never - never

			I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it?
			In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable.

	He re-commences making love to her.

			Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help.
			I - Brad - Oh.

			Brad.

	FRANK places a finger on her lips.

					FRANK
			Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now.  
			Do you want him to see you like this?

					JANET
			Like this - like how?  It's your fault.
			You're to blame.

	His eyes are full of hate.

	He looks at MAGENTA.

	She nods to him.

	He releases the chains.

	ROCKY stirs.

	RIFF RAFF picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts ROCKY.

	ROCKY jumps out of the bed, terrified.

	RIFF RAFF pushes the candelabra in his face.

			Don't worry Janet, we'll be away

	BRAD switches on the bedside lamp an realises he is making love to
	FRANK wearing a JANET wig.

					BRAD
			You!

					FRANK
			I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

	BRAD grabs FRANK around the throat.

					BRAD
			Why you - what have you done with Janet?

					FRANK
			Nothing.  Why do you think I should?

	BRAD lets him go and turns away humiliated.

					BRAD
			You tricked me.  I wouldn't have -
			I've never - never.

					FRANK
			I know, but it wasn't all bad was it?
			I think you found it quite pleasurable.
				(he caresses Brad)
			Oh so soft.  So sensual.

					BRAD
			Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.
				(shouts)
			Janet.

					FRANK
			Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now.
			Do you want her to see you like this?

					BRAD
			Like this.
				(throwing Frank aside)
			Like how?  It's your fault - you're to
			blame.  I thought it was the real thing.

					FRANK
			Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was
			enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime
			in giving yourself over to pleasure.

					FRANK (Switches off light)
			Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time
			already.  Janet needn't know, I won't tell her.

					BRAD
			You promise you won't tell?

					FRANK
			On my mother's grave.

	ROCKY HORROR looks miserable.

					JANET
			Yes.  There you see it's instinctive.

			Don't play games, Dr Scott.  You know

	BRAD looks embarrassed and humiliated.

			I can assure you that Brad's presence

	ROCKY reviles FRANK with a look.  He puts his arm around JANET.

	FRANK is appalled.

					FRANK
			Listen!  I made you, and I can break

	A GONG is heard.  MAGENTA comes through the broken tiles.

					MAGENTA
			Master, dinner is prepared.

	FRANK & RIFF RAFF exchange a look.

			Excellent.  (moves to Dr. Scott)

	At the head of a large coffin shaped table sits FRANK.  There is an

	MAGENTA the wine, both of which they set down at the head of the table.

	RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA pour out the wine and return to the side of FRONT 
	who then rises.

					DR. SCOTT
			We came here to discuss Eddie.

			It's a rather tender subject....

	Everybody looks at their food carefully.

	COLUMBIA rises.

			Excuse me.

	She rushes from from the room with a ghastly cry.

	BRAD & JANET look at each other, then at DR. SCOTT.

			Go on, Dr. Scott - or should I say

			Oh!

	FRANK climbs up the ladder beside the tank.

					DR. SCOTT
			You won't find earth people quite

					BRAD
			You mean...

					DR. SCOTT
			Yes Brad.  It's something we ourselves
			have been working on.  But it

					JANET
			You mean he's gonna send us to

	DIALOGUE SEQUENCE.

					COLUMBIA
			My God!  I can't take any more of this -

			Rocky.  You chew people up and then spit 
			them out - I loved you, do you hear me - 
			I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - 
			I'll tell you - a big nothing.
			You're like a sponge.  You take, take, 
			take, take!  You drain others of their 
			love and emotions.  Well, I've had enough.  
			You've got to choose between me and Rocky - 
			so named because of the rocks in his head.

	FRANK throws a switch, she turns to stone.

					FRANK
			It's not easy having a good time.

	He crosses over to RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA

			Even smiling makes my face ache.

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA nod sympathetically.

	He lies on the operating table.

	They massage.

					FRANK
			My children turn on me.  Rocky's behaving
			just as Eddie did.  Maybe I made a mistake
			in splitting his brain between the two of
			them.

					MAGENTA
				(massaging his temples)
			When will we return to Transylvania?
			I grow weary of this world.

					FRANK
			Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both
			you and your brother RIff Raff - you have
			both served me well - loyalty such as
			yours must be rewarded and you will
			discover when the mood takes me I can
			be quite generous.

	MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck.

					MAGENTA
			I ask for nothing, Master.

	FRANK leaps up from the table.

					FRANK
			And you shall receive it - in abundance.
				(he goes to the lift)
			Come.  We are ready for the floor show.
				(he slams the lift gate)
			Our guests will be growing restless.

	The lift moves downwards.

	Left alone in the laboratory MAGENTA and RIFF RAFF smile at each other.

	They make a special sign and leave by a secret passageway.

148	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

					NARRATOR
			And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - 
			fate it seems had decided that Brad and 
			Janet should keep that appointment with 
			their friend Dr Everett Scott.  But it was 
			to be in a situation which none of them 
			could have possibly foreseen.  And just a 
			few hours after announcing their engagement, 
			Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden 
			fruit.  This in itself was proof that their 
			host was a man of little morals - and some 
			persuasion.  What further indignities were 
			they to be subjected to?  And what of the 
			sonic transducer and floor show that had 
			been spoken of?  What indeed?  From what 
			had gone before, it was clear that this 
			was to be no picnic.

								WIPE TO

149	INT.	BALLROOM (including STAGE)	NIGHT

	MUSIC:	"THE FLOOR SHOW"

	We see the stage at the end of the ballroom with red velvet curtains.

150	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK is enjoying dressing the statues which are now on stage.  Each one
	is lovingly fitted with extravagant variations on the stocking and
	suspender belt variety of his own fantasies.

151	INT.	BALLROOM (INCLUDING STAGE)	NIGHT

	Footlights glowing on the curtains.

								CUT TO

152	INT.	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK pulls a switch and the curtains open.

								CUT TO

153	INT.	BALLROOM STAGE	NIGHT

	Red velvet curtains open to reveal statues in front of silver drapes.
	The floor is covered with a light mist.

								CUT TO

154	INT.	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK beams and pulls lever.

								CUT TO

155	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	COLUMBIA's statue comes to life.

					COLUMBIA
			It was great when it all began
			I was a regular Frank fan.
			But it was over when he had the plan
			To start working on a muscle-man.
			Now the only thing that gives me hope
			Is my love of a certain dope
			Rose tints my world keeps me
			Safe from my trouble and pain.

								CUT TO

					ROCKY
			I'm just seven hours old
			Truly beautiful to behold
			And somebody should be told
			My libido hasn't been controlled
			Now the only thing I've come to trust
			Is an orgasmicÊrush of lust
			Rose tints my world keeps me
			Safe from my trouble and pain.

	BRAD animated by FRANK

158	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

					BRAD
			It's beyond me
			Help me Mommy
			I'll be good you'll see
			Take this dream away
			What's this, let's see
			I feel sexy
			What's come over me
			Here it comes again.

								CUT TO

159	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	JANET animates.  She behaves like a sex goddess, completely out of
	control, as if performing in a burlesque show.

					JANET
			I feel released
			Bad times deceased
			My confidence increased
			Reality is here
			The game has been disbanded
			My mind has been expanded
			It's a gas that Frankie's landed
			His lust is so sincere.

160	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	We PULL BACK on the whole stage.  The velvets open to reveal the 20th
	Century Fox logo as a stage set.

	At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.

	He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak
	which billows in the breeze from a wind machine.  He is reminiscent of
	a 30's film star.

					FRANK
			What ever happened to Fay Wray
			That delicate satin-draped frame
			As it clung to her thigh
			How I started to cry
			For I wanted to be dressed just the same.

								CUT TO

161	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	The floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine
	and glitter.  He beckons the GUESTS.

	In their drugged state they comply with his every wish.


					FRANK
			Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure
			Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
			Erotic nightmares
			Beyond any measure
			And sensual daydreams
			To treasure forever.

	FRANK enters the pool.

			Can't you just see it.
			Can't you just see it.

	They begin to immerse themselves in the pool.

161A			Don't dream it.  Be it.

					ALL
			Don't dream it.  Be it.

	DR SCOTT animates belatedly.

	He observes the orgy occurring in the pool.

					DR. SCOTT
			Ach, we've got to get out of this trap
			before this decadence saps our wills.
			I've got to be strong and try to hang
			on.  Or else my mind, may well snap.

	The wind machine blows the blanked from his lap and we see legs, 
	stockings and a suspender belt.  As in a miracle he can walk again.

					DR. SCOTT
			Und my life will be lived,
			For the thri-i-i-i-ill...

	BRAD surfaces, his face betraying consternation.

					BRAD
			It's beyond me
			Help me Mo-ommy.

	He is pulled back into the pool.

	A thrilled JANET now emerges.

					JANET
			God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.

	FRANK breaks through the water on a lift from ROCKY.

	SONG:		FLOOR SHOW PT. 3 - WILD AND UNTAMED THING.

					FRANK
			My my my my
			I'm a wild and an untamed thing.
			I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
			Get a hit and your mind goes ping.
			Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.
			So let the party and the sounds rock on.
			Gonna shake it till the life has gone.

			Rose tint my world
			Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

	FRANK dives into the pool.

	During the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in
	a frenetic water ballet.

					ALL
			I'm a wild and an untamed thing
			I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
			Get a hit and your mind goes ping
			Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.

	They emerge from the pool and form a kick line.

			So let the part and the sounds rock on
			Gonna shake it till the life has gone.
			Rose tint my world
			Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

162	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	The doors at the opposite end of the ballroom open.

	SONG:		"RIFF RAFF'S RECIT"

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA now dressed in military style space suits, face
	FRANK from the opposite end of the ballroom.

	They applaud slowly.

	RIFF RAFF has a ray gun.

	The characters on stage freeze - terrified.

	It's a showdown across the ballroom.

					RIFF RAFF
			Frank N. Furter
			It's all over
			Your mission is a failure.

	FRANK looks stunned.

			Your life style's too extreme.

	FRANK is guilt-stricken.

			I'm your new Commander.
			You are now my prisoner.

	The GUESTS scramble for the safety of the wings.

			We return to Transylvania
				(he turns to Magenta)
			Prepare the transit beam.

	MAGENTA turns to leave.

					FRANK
			Wait!  I can explain.

163	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	SONG:		"I'M COMING HOME"

	FRANK moves slowly to centre stage.  During the song he adjusts 
	footlight controls to give him what effects he requires.

	The others help FRANK out by singing from the wings.  COLUMBIA operates
	a spotlight.

	BRAD closes silver curtains.

					FRANK
			On the day I went away.

					GUESTS
			Goodbye

					FRANK
			Was all I had to say

					GUESTS
			Now I

					FRANK
			Want to come again and stay

					GUESTS
			Oh my, my,

					FRANK
			Smile and that will mean I may

	He kicks on cloud projection.  Blue skies appear.

					FRANK
			I've seen blue skies
			Through the tears in my eyes
			And I realise
			I'm going home
			I'm going home

	FRANK falls on his knees.

			Everywhere it's been the same

					GUESTS
			Feeling

					FRANK
			Like I'm outside in the rain

					GUESTS
			Wheeling

					FRANK
			Free to try and find a game

					GUESTS
			Dealing

					FRANK
			Cards for sorrow,
			Cards for pain.

	DR SCOTT switches on wind machine.

			I've seen blue skies
			Through the tears in my eyes
			And I realise
			I'm going home
			I'm going home.
			I'm going home.

164	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at FRANK
	who is in an attitude of supplication.

					MAGENTA
			How sentimental.

	RIFF RAFF moves slowly to the stage.

					RIFF RAFF
			And also presumptuous of you.  You
			see when I said "we" were to return
			to Transylvania, I referred only to
			Magenta and myself.

	FRANK looks appalled.

	The GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of
	the "We".

					RIFF RAFF
			You see, you are to remain here,
			in spirit anyway.

	He produces a ray gun.

					DR SCOTT
			Great Heavens, that's a laser.

					RIFF RAFF
			Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of
			emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

					BRAD
			You mean you're going to kill him?
			What's his crime?

					DR SCOTT
			You saw what became of Eddie.
			Society must be protected.

					RIFF RAFF
			Exactly, Dr Scott.  Now Frank N.
			Furter, your time has come.  Say
			goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.

	FRANK raises himself to his full height.

					FRANK
			Do your worse - inferior one.

	As RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, COLUMBIA dashes between them.

	She is killed instantly.

	RIFF RAFF fires again at FRANK.

	FRANK takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain.  The entire proscenium 
	crashes under the weight.  And FRANK is crushed to death among the
	velvet and glittered facia.

	ROCKY breaks down completely.  Although he despised FRANK, he was all he
	had in the world.

	He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms.

	RIFF RAFF can stand no more.

	He fires a blast of laser beam at ROCKY who starts climbing the stairway
	towards the fox skyline.

	RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

	With the body of FRANK in his arms, ROCKY beats on his chest and lets
	out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle.

	RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam.

	ROCKY climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture.

	RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

	They crash to their deaths.

					BRAD
			Good God.

					RIFF RAFF
			Yes.

					JANET
			You've killed them.

	MAGENTA has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful.

					MAGENTA
			I thought you liked them.  They liked you.

					RIFF RAFF
			They didn't like me.  They never liked me.

					DR SCOTT
				(he tries a calming hand)
			You did right.

					RIFF RAFF
			A decision had to be made.

					DR SCOTT
				(the big sell-out)
			You're OK by me.

					RIFF RAFF
			Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.

					DR SCOTT
			Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.

					RIFF RAFF
			You must leave now Dr Scott while it's
			still possible.  We are about to beam
			the entire house back to the planet of
			transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.
			Go now.

	The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door.

	We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special
	sign to each other.

								CUT TO

165	INT.	CASTLE CORRIDORS	NIGHT

	We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind.

165A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.

					RIFF RAFF
			Our noble mission is almost completed my
			most beautiful sister, soon we will return
			to the moon-drenched shores of our
			"androgenous" planet.

					MAGENTA
			Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night -
			to sing and dance once more to your dark
			refrains.  To take that step to the right...

					RIFF RAFF
			But it's the pelvic thrust
			that really drives you insane.

					MAGENTA
			And our World will do
			the Time Warp again.

165B	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN

	There is a huge explosion.

166	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN

	We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then
	vanish into space.

	During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and
	white.

								DISSOLVE TO

167	EXT.	THE CRATER	DAY

	SONG:		"SUPER-HEROES"

	BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides
	surrounding a crater where the castle once was.

	The scene is arid and deserted.  There are remnants of DR SCOTT's
	wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory.

	BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up.

					BRAD
			I've done a lot
			God knows I've tried
			To find the truth I've even lied
			But all I know is down inside.

	DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees.

					BRAD & DR SCOTT
			I'm bleeding.

					JANET
				(revives)
			And super heroes
			Come to feast
			To taste the flesh
			Not yet deceased
			And al I know
			Is still the beast

					TRIO
			Is feeding.

	The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater.

	All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun.

	The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster
	and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness.

								DISSOLVE TO

168	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	The CAMERA has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe
	of the earth on the NARRATOR's desk.

	The NARRATOR puts his hand on the globe, stopping it.

	He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher
	in a pulpit.

					NARRATOR
			And crawling on the planet's face
			Some insects called the human race
			Lost in time, and lost in space
			And meaning.

	He turns and goes to the door of the study.

	He switches off the light.

					VOICES OFF
			Meaning.

	He leaves the study, shutting the door.

	It's almost dark in the study.  Only a sinister glow inside the globe
	of the earth remains.

169	CREDIT SEQUENCE

	SONG:		"SCIENCE FICTION, DOUBLE-FEATURE"

	The cast credits roll up.

					VOICE OVER
			Science Fiction - double-feature
			Frank has built and lost his creature
			Darkness has conquered Brad and Janet
			The servants gone to a distant planet
			Oh - at the late night double-feature
			Picture Show - I want to go - Ohh -
			To the late night double-feature picture show.

				MICHAEL WHITE PRODUCTIONS LTD
				-----------------------------
				THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
				-----------------------------

					Script Amendments			September 12, 1974
					-----------------

The following alterations involve discrepancies between the original 
screenplay and current script revisions and design decisions.

1/2	The film will now commence in Black and White on "ACADEMY"
	format.  It will extend to wide screen (1.1 - 85) at
	Sequence 41, while still remaining in black and white.  At
	Sequence 54 the film changes to colour.

15	Now read "Denton Episcopalian Church".

23	Brad and Janet will arrive at the gate entrance to Oakley Court.
	This deletes a later reference to gates in 33.  From hereon ignore
	all references to rock formations etc., as the grounds of
	Oakley Court are the only location involved in the approach to the
	house.

25	Three motorbikes drive past Brad and disappear around the house.

26	This window will be in turret in Oakley Court.  Ignore all
	references to adjoining 'massive lighted window'.

30	This shot will be of a Gryphem on the Oakley Court facade.

32	This will be of some similar detail to the above.

38	"Stairway" references now allude to the front entrance hall of
	Oakley Court.

40	Delete references to "mirrors reflecting to infinity".

47	Columbia now is astride a Juke Box.  The band are cut.

54a	Red streamers and Black and White balloons fall.  Not just
	streamers.

69	All future references to the operating table in the Lab now
	should be applied either to the TANK or the vaulting horse
	(part of the gymnasium equipment) - whichever is applicable.

75	Delete references to the Ice-block.  Eddie now crashes
	through a wall of Coca Cola bottles and ice.  He is also equipped
	with a saxaphone rather than a guitar.

87a	Rocky now escapes through the lift shaft.  This may involve
	a shot from the vestibule showing Rocky climbing out of lift
	cage and running out of the house.  It may also involve the
	double bed in the bridal suite collapsing during the escape
	sequence.

91	It is still raining.

92	Janet is now stumbling around the staircase in Oakley Court.

103	This sequence may now also involve Riff-Raff, Magenta,
	Columbia, Frank, Brad and selected Transylvanians.

106	Will now have Frank, Riff-Raff, and Brad entering the Lab
	in the lift cage.

108	It is still raining.

116	Dr Scott will now break through the tiled wall of the laboratory
	on the area of ramp above the control panel.

117	Magenta will now appear through the broken tile area created
	by Dr Scott.

122/140 This sequence will be altered to Dr Scott holding a
	photograph album containing a still photograph equivalent
	of the "flashbacks" referred to in this sequence.

143/4	All entrances to the Lab will be via the broken tiled entrance.

	Delete all references to the floor lowering.

147	The "secret passage" is now the broken tile entrance.

164	Frank tries to scale up the silver drapes which descend on
	him with Tab tracks, rope supports, etc.

MEMO:  SCRIPT ALTERATIONS

FROM:  JIM SHARMAN				9.12.74

TO:    ALL CONCERNED.


Sc. 148  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.N>

As scripted up to;  What further indignities were they
to be subjected to?

Then please add:	And what of the floor show that had been
spoken of?  In an empty house?  In the middle of the night.
What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?  From what had gone before it was clear that
this was to be no picnic.


Sc. 97.  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.  N.

Is replaced by the following:

Emotion is a powerful and irrational master, and, from what
Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television
monitor there seemed little doubt that Janet was indeed it's
slave.


SC. 77 pt.

C.S. FRANK				FRANK
			Oh no my baby - don't be upset -
			it was a mercy killing.  He had
			a certain naive charm - but no muscle.
Rush Hour

 

				RUSH HOUR

			Original Screenplay

				  by

				Ross LaManna
FADE IN:

EXT.  LOS ANGELES - DAY

The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the
summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and
wake me up.

EXT.  LAX - DAY

The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly
with stretch limousines.

INT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY

Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers
and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the
crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of
Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

				REPORTER
			(to TV CAMERA)
		Eager to mend its tarnished image,
		Los Angeles has really put out the
		welcome mat for tomorrow's summit.
		The city promises quite a party as
		leaders from Japan, China, South
		Korea, Australia, the U.S. and
		others begin talks for the largest
		free-trade treaty in history.

The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries
arriving.

Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		The one sour note is North Korea,
		the only Pacific Rim country not
		participating. There are rumors of
		secret meetings with North Korean
		representatives, but U.S. officials
		insist the North must first hold
		democratic elections, and halt its
		nuclear weapons program -- as they
		claimed to have done back in 1995.

We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.

The SCENE returns to LAX.

				REPORTER (VO)
			(continuing)
		Tensions remain high since last
		year's skirmishes between North Korea
		and the U.S. So any chance of the
		communist North joining the Pacific
		Partners seems highly unlikely.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only
one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
     
				Consulate
				 of the
		Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

BACK TO SCENE

The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

NEW ANGLE

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

				SAM
		I can't stand it -- half an hour to
		get to the stupid school every
		morning... with no music...
			(Korean; subtitled)
		[Just our damn Nanny...]

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS

Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

WIDER

Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

				DRIVER
			(Korean)
		[Stay in the car.]



EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

ANGLE WITH JAVAL

as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

							FADE TO:



EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY

Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

							CUT TO:

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

				CARSON
		Son of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

				MIRANDA
		Pete... please... we have to be up
		early tomorrow. Call the police.



				CARSON
		Yeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Shit!

MIRANDA

pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

				MIRANDA
		Not again...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

NEW ANGLE

Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

				WESTEC GUARD
		Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
		the ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

				CARSON
		Asshole was trying to boost my car!

ANGLE ACROSS STREET

Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

				CARSON
		Mike -- call 911!

				NEIGHBOR
		Been trying...
			(has a cordless phone)
		It's busy.
			(to Guards; re Carson)
		He's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

CLOSER

Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

				JOY
		There are six bathrooms in this
		house, Sam.

				SAM
			(fanning the air)
		But only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(Korean)
		[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing)
		[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

				MRS. HAN
		It's the Governess...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Hilda...

CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS

as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

				GOVERNESS
			(thru phone)
		Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We will see you next week...
			(hangs up; smiles to kids)
		It appears I'll be taking you to
		school.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

				JAVAL
		Very good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY

Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

ANGLE ON TV

A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
		gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
		July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
		rolled into one! All over town
		there'll be parades, concerts,
		rallies, festivals... So get out
		there everyone, but plan your drive-
		time accordingly! This is Bobbi
		Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

				MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
			(on TV)
		The President is on his way...

				PRESIDENT
			(on TV)
		...It's an honor hosting my fellow
		leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
		city of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

				MORNING ANCHOR
			(on TV)
		We'll see the menu for Mayor
		Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
		after this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

BACK TO SCENE

As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

				MIRANDA
		I was watching that.

				CARSON
		If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
		I'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

				CARSON
			(continuing; while smiling)
		I said, if we were having sex once in
		a while, you wouldn't need to ride
		that fucking bike every morning.



				MIRANDA
			(hasn't heard a thing)
		Be right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY

Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

				MIRANDA
			(looks him over)
		Have you gotten any sleep lately?

				CARSON
			(ignores the question)
		Shop's gonna tow the car in --
		goddamn ignition's trashed.

				MIRANDA
		Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

				CARSON
		You ask me, those suckers are a lost
		cause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

				MIRANDA
		It's not for you.

				CARSON
		You mean it's not for you.

				MIRANDA
		I don't chase car thieves in my
		underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
		boredom if we ever sold this house
		and moved.



				CARSON
		I'd die of shock, from finding
		anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
		Even for what it's worth now.

				MIRANDA
		Lots of people bought at the top of
		the market...

				CARSON
		That sure cheers me right up.

				MIRANDA
		I don't know why we even talk about
		it. The city's not the problem. So
		we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
		that saying: "Wherever you go, there
		you are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		I hope you're current on your
		tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

				CARSON
		One cut... two assholes in the
		hospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Well, another day of baby-sitting my
		favorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

				MIRANDA
		Ask for a transfer.

				CARSON
		They're not gonna transfer me. You
		know damn well why I was bumped down
		to guard duty...
			(as he's leaving)
		My outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY

A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
SWEARING:

				ANGRY VOICE (OS)
		Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
		shit...

THEIR POV

In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

JOY

turns to Mrs. Han:

				JOY
		Can we give Lisa a ride?

INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY

It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

				LISA
		Hey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



				LISA
			(continuing)
		Excellent -- I can't hear him!

				SAM
			(raps on window)
		The glass is an inch thick.
			(points to doors, roof)
		Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
		proof.

				LISA
		Perfect car for L.A.
			(looks back at her Dad)
		Starts, too.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.



				ROBBINS
		Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
		escaped the office!

				DAVE
		I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
		a chance to hose out my cage.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

				ROBBINS
		Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

				SABATINI
		"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
		call him.
			(yawns; flops in a chair)
		Friggin' graveyard shift...

				ROBBINS
		Love to know what dope made it the
		Bureau's job to give full-time
		protection to foreign consulates.
			(offers coffee to Dave)
		Cup a mud?

				DAVE
		Not if you made it. Why don't you
		get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
		the alleged chick.

				SABATINI
		Blow me.

				DAVE
		Where's Carson?

				SABATINI
		On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
		off his Mustang last night.
			(beat; solemnly)
		They cut the ragtop.

				DAVE
		Motherfuckers...

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.



				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Latest and greatest. Wireless
		network link-ups.

				SABATINI
		Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

				ROBBINS
		Me, too.

				DAVE
		Ingrates.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY

The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



INSERT

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

WIDER

The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



				JAVAL
		You see that I'm serious in my
		intention, yes?
			(she nods)
		If you cooperate, you and your
		children will be home for dinner
		tonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

				COLONEL LEE
			(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
		[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Someone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



				SABATINI
		You got no jurisdiction outside
		this property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

				SABATINI
			(continuing)
		Shit!
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Yank his fuckin' leash!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		My men are going!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing; to Sabatini)
		It's a white telephone van, driving
		west on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

				ROBBINS
		Keys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

				SABATINI
		You're ridin' shotgun.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

				ROBBINS
		Cherry?

				DAVE
		Under the seat.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

				ROBBINS
		Siren?

				DAVE
		I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
		hurry..!



EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

				SABATINI
		Someone snatched Han's family! White
		phone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

				CARSON
		Give me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

				CO-WORKER
		Someone's been to Nordstroms, big
		time.

				WALTHER
		Clothes make the man.

				CO-WORKER
		But does the man make enough for the
		clothes?

				WALTHER
			(smiles)
		The man makes payments on his Visa.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.



				SECRETARY
		Mr. Walther... priority line!

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
		Walther... What's the nature of your
		emer --
			(grimaces)
		Aw, Jesus... not today...
			(beat)
		I'll inform channels and get a copter
		in the air. For God's sake, keep it
		quiet. Do what you can, but don't
		endanger civilians or the family!

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		You bet -- nice and easy.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Get the Secretary of State on the
		horn.
			(listens)
		I know he left already. I'm familiar
		with the concept of time zones. Find
		his ass.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on
		its way.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.



INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Think it's them?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll
		move up; he won't suspect a civilian
		car. Stay back, then get on his ass
		when I signal. We'll box him in.

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		If the Mod Squad gets in your way,
		don't be shy about getting 'em out.

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Copy that one.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

				SABATINI
		Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

HIS POV

As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



JAVAL

grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

				JAVAL
		I need to concentrate!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

NEW ANGLE

The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY

Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's gonna wrap it around something!

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



NEW ANGLE

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

				COLONEL LEE
		You should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

				CARSON
		I'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

				ROBBINS
		Forget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY

A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing
that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.



				CARSON
		Let's get back to the Consulate.

Off their perplexed looks, we

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

				JAVAL
		Does anyone need to use the rest
		room? This will be your last
		opportunity for a few hours.
			(no takers)
		Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,
		please sit here.
			(indicates the Lazy Boys;
			then turns to Lisa)
		And you... what is your name?

				LISA
			(after a beat)
		Lisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

				JAVAL
		No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

				JAVAL
			(continuing; sotto)
		You afford me some additional
		bargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		There. No taping your mouths, no
		restraints. Please remain still
		while I explain. The meters on the
		left indicate sound pressure --
		Decibels. There are microphones on
		your chair backs. If you raise your
		voices above certain level, putting
		your meter in the red zone for more
		than one sustained second, the
		circuit will be closed.
			(beat)
		The right meters indicate motion.
		There are pressure sensors inside the
		armrests and seats. The sensors don't
		like to get wet, so I hope you were
		honest about not needing to use the
		loo. If you make any excess
		movements, or try to leave your
		chair, the circuit will be closed.

				MRS. HAN
		I don't understand...

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

				MRS. HAN
			(continuing; softly)
		What happens if the circuit closes?

				JAVAL
		Kaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Easy... deep breath...
			(to the kids)
		Do each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(on TV)
		...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
		whole city had an such an opportunity --

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

				WALTHER
		Carson?
			(Carson nods)
		Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

				CARSON
		His Security Chief.
			(beat)
		There was a civilian with them --
		fifteen-year-old girl from across
		the street. We're trying to reach
		the parents.

				WALTHER
		Goddamn it...
			(sotto)
		Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
		Premier's niece! We're hearing
		rumors they're gonna make a major
		issue out of what happened here...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

				CARSON
		I'm not so sure what happened here.
		Something smells. Asshole was acting
		like he wanted us to spot him...



				WALTHER
		What the hell are you talking about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		Mr. Walther?

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.

				WALTHER
		Ambassador Han... my deepest --

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		-- I have no wish for condolences.
		Just answers.

				WALTHER
		As soon as we have any to give...

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		Yoon..?!

				CARSON
			(to FBI agents)
		Start a trace!

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Carson; incensed)
		You are tapping our phones?!

				CARSON
			(while crossing to
			Ambassador Han)
		Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
		Streep.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.



				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We are not hurt. But this man is
		very serious --

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

				JAVAL
			(into phone)
		I want you to remember the feeling
		you had when you thought your family
		was dead, and use it to inform the
		choices you're about to make.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

				CARSON
		Say you want to talk to the kids...

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		I need to know my children are all
		right.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Be in front of a television in two
		minutes. Tune it to channel four.
		You'll get the picture.

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There is a television in my office.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're screwed on the trace -- he's
		on a cell phone.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

				DAVE
		Play the tape back. I might be able
		to pull the electronic serial number
		out of the subcarrier.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Ask Dave if he knows how to find the
		phone's serial number.

				ROBBINS
			(smiles; into radio)
		Hey, great idea...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

ANGLE ON TV

It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

CLOSER

There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
			(beat)
		Look at the TV -- this was just
		taken.

BACK TO SCENE

A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.



				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		There must surely be several people
		in the room; you may put me on the
		speakerbox if you wish.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(continuing; thru
			speakerbox)
		I am not a terrorist. Your
		countries' political posturing means
		nothing to me. So do not waste time
		trying to negotiate.
			(beat)
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
		Angeles can furnish ten million
		dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
		required denominations are in the
		instructions, as is the method of
		packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
		PM, and drive north on Highland
		Avenue. I will call with where to
		leave the money, which you will do
		at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
		call again at 4:00 with the family's
		location and the method for removing
		them from their... predicament.
		Could you please refer to page one?
			(they look at the photo)
		Any deviation from these instructions
		and my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Walther)
		P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

				WALTHER
		Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
		Negotiator is on the way --

				CARSON
		-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
		thing we need! This asshole sound
		like he was interested in bargaining?

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:


				WALTHER
		We have people who are experts in
		these situations. We really feel it
		would be best if you let them
		coordinate everything...

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

				WALTHER
			(continuing; to Carson)
		Let's get on it...

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

				CARSON
		...You're gonna just pay up, count
		on his good nature to return the
		family?!

				WALTHER
		It's the President's intention to
		keep this quiet, move forward with
		the Summit, and work with the North
		Koreans. Jesus, you've already
		embarrassed the shit out of us over
		the phone surveillance --

				CARSON
		-- They know their phones are tapped!
		They tap our fucking phones!

				WALTHER
		That's not the point! The point is
		not acknowledging it!
			(beat)
		We got an international incident
		brewing, with a country we were
		practically at war with last year!
		Our best Negotiator is gonna run
		point. If you got a problem, you can
		take the goddamn rest of the day off.

				CARSON
		This Consulate is my responsibility.

				WALTHER
		Not any more.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.



				WALTHER
			(continuing)
		That's the Negotiator. You do the
		briefing.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

				CARSON
		...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
		There are events gearing up all
		around town, and a dozen world
		leaders arriving. Add the Friday
		rush hour and usual L.A. bad
		behavior and it'll be a nightmare
		out there by 3 PM. It all works to
		the advantage of the kidnapper,
		hinders our pursuit efforts...
			(frowns)
		You don't agree?

WIDER


The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.


It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.

				MIRANDA
		I'm wondering whether to believe him
		when he says he's strictly motivated
		by money.

				CARSON
			(grabs faxes back)
		You see one word of Peoples'-
		Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
		whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
		this-week bullshit in this entire
		letter?

				MIRANDA
		I still want to check the MO against
		known politicals, terrorists --



				CARSON
		-- Already doing it. We're
		coordinating with the Secret
		Service, the NSA and the CIA.

				MIRANDA
		Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
		them a cover story for the media
		about the crash on La Cienega.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

				WALTHER
		Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
		is your wife?!

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

				CARSON
			(while looking at Miranda)
		If she'd changed her name when we
		got married, I wouldn't have to.

				MIRANDA
			(to Carson)
		I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
		finally work together...

				WALTHER
		Jesus, forget I asked.
			(beat)
		The cash will be here in an hour.
			(to Miranda)
		Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
		thoughts?

				MIRANDA
		Everything indicates he's working
		alone. And his concerns do seem to
		be solely about the money... so I
		agree that he's only using the
		Summit and the tension with North
		Korea to create extreme motivation
		to pay the ransom.

				COLONEL LEE
		I will bring the money to him.

				CARSON
		My ass.

				COLONEL LEE
		The hostages are citizens of the
		People's Republic of Korea --

				CARSON
		-- Hey, do I go to the torture
		chambers in your prisons, tell you
		how to do your job?

				WALTHER
		All right, you're outta here! Is
		this the same insubordinate crap you
		pulled at Beverly Thrift?

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

				CARSON
		I'll coordinate the drop.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Perhaps that is better. Inspector
		Carson knows the terrain --

				COLONEL LEE
		-- Then he can come with me.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

				WALTHER
			(firm; to Carson)
		It's settled.

				CARSON
		It sucks.

				MIRANDA
		But it means we can get on with it.

The Americans leave the room.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

				MIRANDA
			(sotto)
		Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
		If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
		Beverly Thrift never would've
		happened.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

				JAVAL
		That's more like it...

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

				OPERATIVE
			(into uplink device)
		...They've got the Premier agreeing
		to the hard-line position --

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

				OPERATIVE
			(continuing; sotto)
		More to follow...

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

				DAVE
		I wanted to be home by now, take the
		kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

				SABATINI
		We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
		L.A. was supposed to be a brown
		blotch in the rear-view mirror.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

				MIRANDA
		He'll expect a homing device --

				CARSON
		-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
		check the cash with an RF detector...
			(re larger transmitter)
		Meaning he'll find this one.
			(re smaller transmitter)
		This only has a quarter-mile range,
		but on a frequency too low to detect.
			(turns off receiver)
		And I doubt the asshole will have an
		X-ray machine or a metal detector.

				MIRANDA
		Why must you always refer generically
		to criminals as "assholes?"

				CARSON
		Gosh, you're right. It could
		undermine their self-esteem and spoil
		their chances for rehabilitation.

	
				MIRANDA
		You been reading my magazines in the
		bathroom again?

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru recorder)
		"And my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

				MIRANDA
		He's really exhibiting pressured
		speech... big effort here to sound
		calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
		he were in control, he wouldn't feel
		such a need to sound that way.

				CARSON
		Just tell me if we can use it.

				MIRANDA
		If we needle him he could get sloppy
		and give us an opening, but I'm not
		going to risk it. This is the worst
		kind of perpetrator: anything makes
		him deviate from his carefully-
		scripted plan, he could become
		extremely volatile.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Do we have back-up if the bleeper
		fails?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Nothing but physical surveillance.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

				MIRANDA
		It's real important we don't lose
		him. He didn't go through all the
		trouble of designing that bomb not
		to use it.

Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.



				CARSON
		Well, it ain't gonna happen.
			(beat; sotto)
		Not again...

EXT.  WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF
DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit
nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.
The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell is the big crisis?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		We just received a missive from the
		North Korean attachÈ. They say the
		kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
		and humiliate them during the Summit.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Bullshit. They're just ticked because
		we don't want the Chinese dragging
		their asses into the treaty talks.

The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		We have a covert operative in place.
		He reports the hard-liners and
		moderates in the High Command are
		arguing about how to respond, should
		the Premier's niece and her children
		should be killed.

				PRESIDENT
			(scowls; thru video link)
		Respond?! Christ. What about the
		damn Premier?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		He's weak. He has to look tough to
		save face, keep control of hard-
		liners... otherwise he risks a coup.

				CIA CHIEF
		Which is a real possibility. Most of
		those old-fart Generals don't want to
				-more-

				CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)
		be part of the Summit any more than
		we want them to. They're mad as hell
		he even talked to the Chinese.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't want to deal with this right
		now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell
		the North we'll pay the ransom for
		'em... Placate 'em! And make damn
		sure we get that family back in one
		piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?

				FBI CHIEF
		The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack
		team in place.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		There's a Diplomatic Liaison from
		State, too.

				CIA CHIEF
			(to FBI Chief)
		What about your man stationed at the
		Consulate...
			(refers to notes)
		Carson? He was demoted from the FBI
		Hostage Program, couple years back.
		And this did happen on his watch...

				FBI CHIEF
			(irritated)
		There's no way he could've prevented
		this abduction! Besides, I've got one
		of my top Negotiators in charge --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- Whatever. I want a total news
		blackout and I want this over with,
		quickly! Without giving those Commie
		little bastards any excuse to shit
		all over my Summit!

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the
driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is
already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is
completely in the car.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town
is all done up with posters and banners.

Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an
unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag
Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the
two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		Yes, please go ahead...

				JAVAL (VO)
			(long beat; thru phone)
		Ah... this must be one of those

		You're to leave the money in the

		Shit... no way we can set up a stake-
		out in...

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(checks watch)
		Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers
		at the Bowl. Have them clear the

		Remember, Pete... we're dealing with

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Must've bought a house same time we

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland
near Hollywood Blvd.

Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising
around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.

A BIKER CLUB

of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn
from the Boulevard onto Highland.

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood
Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a
sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.

Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money
from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the
pavement. Carson looks around.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		There's about a hundred ways he can
		scurry off like a cockroach from
		here... So spread out.

Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs
a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,
smacks his arm and points ahead:

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above
the bags of money.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream
		truck!

EXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY

Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector
wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them
makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY

The van pulls away.

Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.
He looks up...

Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.

				DAVE
		Son of a bitch!
			(into radio)
		He found the bleepers -- both of
		them!

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like
		he'll be hard to see in that truck.
		Which way's he heading?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Toward the freeway.

Carson hangs a U-turn.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,
Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		What happened?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're made! Gotta grab him!

				MIRANDA
			(beat; into radio)
		All right... Carefully...

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.

				CARSON
		Watch it! We need him alive!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.

				COLONEL LEE
		Turn around!

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

				CARSON
		FBI. Call our office, they'll take
		care of you.

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

				BIKER
		I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
		dentist!

COLONEL LEE

gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

WIDER

When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

				CARSON
		Just don't kill yourself, you piece
		of shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Helicopter or two would be nice!

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Love to be in the loop on this...

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Not just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

				CARSON
			(continuing; grumbling)
		I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
		horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

JAVAL

speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's on foot, at the base of the
		elevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

CLOSER

From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

BEHIND CARSON

the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

NEW ANGLE

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

				CARSON
		Fingerprint it.
			(to Walther)
		He's not gonna tell us where to find
		the hostages...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(looks at watch)
		Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
		figure it out for ourselves.

				WALTHER
		Figure it out?! With what?!

				CARSON
			(ignores him; into radio)
		Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
			(to Robbins)
		Get back to his van. There were no
		plates, but check the VIN, look it
		over, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Go!

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		...Scrounge us some bodies: National
		Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
		PD's, meter maids --

				WALTHER
		-- They're gonna search the whole
		city in a goddamn hour..?!

				CARSON
		Look, I don't need you to tell me
		how fucked we are!

				WALTHER
		Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
		case something explodes!

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

				MIRANDA
		Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
		is a luxury we can't afford!
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
			(looks at Carson)
		What's done is done. There'll be
		plenty of time to point fingers
		later.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

				SABATINI
		I need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		This is impossible! How can you even
		begin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

				MIRANDA
		Well, the normal procedure is to
		negotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

				CARSON
		Let's take stock. We've got a picture
		of where he hid the family, and
		recordings of his calls --

				MIRANDA
		-- That's right! We can send them to
		our experts for analysis...

				CARSON
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Same with his fingerprints. But that
		means we need high-quality image and
		data transmission. We can piss away
		ten minutes coptering this shit to
		our offices in Westwood, or we can
		use your surveillance equipment.

				COLONEL LEE
		There is no surveillance equipment.
		This is a diplomatic facility --

				CARSON
		-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Take them upstairs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

				CARSON
		South Korean Consulate's just down
		the street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

				CARSON
			(continuing; re hand)
		Shitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
		Got a digital scanner?

				COLONEL LEE
		Analog.

				CARSON
			(looks equipment over)
		You might want to drop a few bucks at
		Radio Shack and get with the decade.
			(into radio)
		Dave -- get in here. Bring your
		computer, a city map, and the tapes
		of the ransom calls.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		On my way...

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



				MIRANDA
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
		him to the Ambassador, see if it's
		anyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
		of prints coming over. Narrow the
		search criteria: Male, thirties,
		Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
		maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and
		bombers first. We need an answer in
		fifteen minutes.

EXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

FBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g.

INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY

A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high-

		That yellow air out there finally
		rot your brain?! It's impossible!

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Dazzle me.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		We got one of the best sound guys
		right here in town...
			(into phone)
		Newman in Audio Analysis...

				DAVE (OS)
		Newman's gone.

WIDER

Dave comes into the room.



				DAVE
		He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
		bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

				DAVE
			(continuing; looks around)
		Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
		to see the fight tonight.

				CARSON
		Get those tapes transferred to a
		sound guy. We need ambient and
		background analysis, the whole
		enchilada.

				DAVE
		Enchilada -- you saying that because
		I'm Mexican?

				CARSON
		No... 'cause you're fat.

				MIRANDA
			(picks up Javal's fax)
		Photo enhancement... Isn't there
		some amazing tech with the LAPD --

				DAVE
		-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
		PD a month ago.

				CARSON
		Jesus H. Christ...

				SABATINI
		I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
		earn their keep.

				CARSON
		Do it.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.

				MIRANDA
		Given his behavior, this orange
		residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
		Amphetamines.

				CARSON
		Any significance?



				MIRANDA
		It's consistent with the lone wolf
		scenario: A handful of these is pure
		bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
		psychosis and paranoia kick in.
			(beat)
		We could check pharmacy records, on
		the remote chance he got them
		legally... if we had a couple of
		weeks, that is.

				CARSON
			(to Sabatini)
		Get the Bureau on it.

				MIRANDA
		Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

				CARSON
		Look, goddammit, you start skipping
		no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
		quit and go to the beach right now.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
		last certain visual we had was just
		before his van went into the alley
		on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
		Consulate at 9:30.

				MIRANDA
		That gives him about fifty minutes
		to get to his location, move and
		secure the hostages, and activate
		his time bomb.

				CARSON
		He probably waited a while to pad
		the time -- he wanted us know the
		family was still alive...
			(sotto; re Koreans)
		...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
		throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
		but he didn't want to call too soon,
		either. I say they're within 15 to
		20 minutes, via surface streets, of
		where we last saw them.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.



				MIRANDA
		The most densely-populated part of
		the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
		to about 200,000 dwellings.

A beat while this sinks in.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		He was traveling west --

				CARSON
		-- Bet he doubled back.

				MIRANDA
		C'mon, that's total conjecture --

				SABATINI
			(re Carson)
		-- I'd trust his instincts when
		dealing with maniacs. He is deeply
		disturbed.

				MIRANDA
		You're telling me?

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
		accusing us of botching the ransom
		drop on purpose.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They're still harping on that
		"American plot" nonsense.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Meaning?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They say the death of the Premier's
		niece and her family would justify
		immediate retaliation.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
		What kind of retaliation?

Everyone in the room looks at one another.



				CIA CHIEF
		They're threatening to pull a Saddam
		Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
		at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
			(beat)
		They're talking about firing a
		missile into Los Angeles --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- A goddamn WHAT??

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
		cruise -- their version of our
		Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
		find the city, but it's not too
		accurate beyond that.

				VICE PRESIDENT
		Still, for their purposes it's
		perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
		out a city block or two...

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		To the eyes of the world it's a
		measured response -- like what Reagan
		did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
		at an American city would be a huge
		psychological victory for them.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't believe I'm hearing this!
			(beat)
		So if we know it's coming, we can
		knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		These weapons fly subsonically, below
		radar... we don't have the defenses
		in place... If we'd had the time to
		deploy a string of Patriot anti-
		missile batteries across the coast --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- You're saying we got all this
		lousy hardware and can't stop one
		goddamn missile??

Everyone's silence answers his question.



				PRESIDENT
			(continuing; thru video
			link)
		I want an immediate search for all
		ships within range.

				FBI CHIEF
		We better inform the other leaders,
		stall on the Summit --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		There's no reason to panic yet --
		they can't launch until after the
		family's confirmed dead!

				CIA CHIEF
		Afraid that's not the case...

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The North Korean Premier holds what
		we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
		able to destroy a missile in flight,
		right up to the moment before it
		achieves its target.

				CIA CHIEF
		Our Op says they've timed their
		retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

				FBI CHIEF
		And if the family turns up okay,
		they'll just make it self-destruct.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Shit! I really don't need this today!

				VICE PRESIDENT
		We're forgetting one thing here: the
		family. Intelligence is sure the
		North will abort their attack if Mrs.
		Han and her kids are safely returned?

				CIA CHIEF
		Absolutely. Their whole game depends
		on claiming a legitimate provocation.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Still, we should let them know there'd
		be a response... if it comes to it.



				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'd like to turn 'em into a
		radioactive parking lot.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		That's the problem: we can't. We're
		the last superpower. Our hands are
		tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
		stacks of treaties... most we could
		do is give 'em a "measured response"
		back again, or everyone starts
		crying that we're the bullies.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
		wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
		stunt like this.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Believe me, the North drops one in
		my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in
		theirs. Get some bombers in the air.
		And don't tell me any more bad news!

Everyone who can be spared, even moth-eaten SUPPORT PERSONNEL,
hustle through the maze of hallways and get into waiting cars.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

From up here, it looks like the city is one big block party.
Accordingly, traffic is heavy and unpleasant.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity.

				BOBBI
		This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye

The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot.



				BOBBI
			(continuing; furious)
		Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that
		entire segment!
			(as if to a child)
		Keep... the sun... to my left!!

The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.

				BOBBI
			(continuing)
		What's new on the kidnapping rumor?

				CAMERAMAN
		Nada. Total news blackout.

				BOBBI
		Go back over the hill.

				NEWS PILOT
		We got the valley traffic report in
		fifteen --

				BOBBI
		-- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed!
		Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!

She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her
purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She
takes a huge swig and grimaces.

				BOBBI
			(continuing; to Cameraman)
		What are you lookin' at? I was the
		morning anchor in Houston! And I'm

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy
carefully turns to her mother.

		What if something goes wrong?

				MRS. HAN
			(firmly)
		It won't.



INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair.

				CARSON
		I'm going to the kidnapping site.

				MIRANDA
		I want to talk to the witnesses.

Colonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him.

				CARSON
		Great, we'll hire a bus.

They leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand.

				DAVE

		...I know it's privileged

				SABATINI
		Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of

				DAVE
		That's what I'm trying to get.
		They're saying I need a subpoena.
			(into phone)
		Don't put me on hold... Don't...

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.

We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some
Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.



INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.

Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote-
control boxes. He picks up his radio.

				ROBBINS
			(into radio)
		A lot of the components are made by

		security company.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Jump a copter to the Consulate. See
		if the manufacturer sells to the
		public. Find out what shops use their
		stuff; put people on the phones with
		a description of the perp.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

NEW ANGLE

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.

				YOUNG COP
		Inspector! Look at this...
			(reads from shell)
		"Dragon's Breath..?"



				CARSON
		Twelve-gauge shell filled with
		magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's
		worse than napalm -- Geneva
		Convention outlawed it for warfare.

				MIRANDA
		Then how did he get it?

				CARSON
		Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.
			(looks around)
		Where's the Consulate's car?

				YOUNG COP
			(beat)
		Uh... apparently it was stolen...

				COLONEL LEE
		Stolen!? What is it with you
		people --

				YOUNG COP
			(angry)
		-- What's this "you people" shit?

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Shut up!

				MIRANDA
			(aside; to Young Cop)
		He means all of us "you people."

				CARSON
			(to Young Cop)
		Find it! How many bulletproof
		Mercedes could be cruising around
		Crenshaw?

				YOUNG COP
		You'd be surprised...

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Ambassador Han, Walther and Sabatini are looking at a series
of high-definition faxes spread out on a table.

Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.

				CARSON
		Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was
		working alone, and he was a vicious
		son of a bitch. Old news.

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Ambassador Han)
		And our car was stolen.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I felt safer when I was the
		Ambassador to Libya.

				SABATINI
		Image enhancements came back.

POV OF PICTURES

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

				CARSON
		We going steady?



				SABATINI
		The sun position tells us the
		windows are facing northeast.
			(beat)
		Here's the best -- look at the glass
		on the prints hanging in the
		background. There's a reflection of
		a reflection, out on the street: the
		corner of a billboard.

				CARSON
		Looks like the wheel of a car.

				MIRANDA
		We talked about these billboards,
		when we were car shopping! Four-
		door... they make a wagon, too.
			(beat)
		Something Japanese... God, what was
		it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You
		thought it had no character.

				CARSON
		I thought that about all of them.
		C'mon, think, dammit!!

				MIRANDA
		You think!! You were there, too!

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

				CARSON
		Call the outdoor advertising
		companies. Get the location of all
		the billboards for Japanese cars
		within our search parameters.

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

				DAVE
			(into phone)
		...Peerless Auto Security. We need
		to know whether you've sold a large

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY

General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major
Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the
others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call
with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.

							CUT TO:

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device.

				OPERATIVE
			(urgently; into device)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped! It was switched by
		order of --

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"
button on the uplink device before dying.

On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then
another GUNSHOT destroys it.

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative
over with his foot.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is
trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.

				MRS. HAN
		He asked you if you had to go...

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

				JOY
		Oh, my God...

The meters are hovering just below the red...



SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,
still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the
tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
		using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.



				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
			(continuing)
		Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
		they attacked a Genoese fort, and
		catapulted infected corpses over the
		walls. The Genoese who survived
		carried the disease back to Europe...
		and it killed half the population.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Get to the goddamn point, Major.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

				CIA CHIEF
		Seems the missile is armed with a
		warhead carrying the Pneumonic
		Plague.

The President goes nuts.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
		to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
		What happened to this "limited
		retaliation" shit?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		The North Koreans insist the missile
		carries a conventional payload. They
		say we're trying to trick them into
		aborting the attack.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Especially since the uplink from our
		Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.

				CIA CHIEF
		We think one of the Hard-liners
		switched the warhead without the
		Premier's knowledge. But he's not
		about to take our word for it, and
		he's too weak to risk the
		humiliation of backing down.

				PRESIDENT
			(incredulous; thru video
			link)
		They use a biological weapon on
		American soil, they have to know
		we'll respond!



				SECRETARY OF STATE
		Maybe they don't think we got the
		guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
		they think they can whip us, like
		what happened in 'Nam. Look who
		we're dealing with: a teetering,
		outlaw regime, and inside it, some
		wild-ass renegades working their
		screwy agenda!

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		We've deployed Marines from Pendleton
		and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.
		Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,
		but it's 40 minutes before they're on
		the ground.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		All right. Assuming the worst...
		What'll happen?

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The warhead vents the plague
		bacteria above the target area,
		infecting about 50,000 people. First
		symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes
		become swollen; temperature rises to
		105. Victims turn deep purple from
		lung hemorrhaging, usually die the
		same day.
			(beat)
		There are treatments -- streptomycin
		and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
		overwhelmed by the numbers and its
		extreme contagiousness.

				CIA CHIEF
		We could have 500,000 infected in a
		week, who knows how many after that.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have
		the Summit leaders been warned?



				FBI CHIEF
		Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
		'til we give the all-clear.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		And you're sure it's safe if we can
		get 'em to destroy the missile in
		flight?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The bacteria can't survive the heat
		of an explosion.

				CIA CHIEF
		I suggest none of this go any
		further -- not even to the agents
		working to find the family. Word
		leaks out to a city of 12 million
		people there's rocket full of the
		Plague coming at 'em, you'll create
		a panic of biblical proportions.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is painfully on edge. Ambassador Han paces. The FBI
agents are on a phone or a radio, working leads.

Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.

				CARSON
		Say what?

				COLONEL LEE
		Perhaps someone will decide it is
		foolish to incur the wrath of North
		Korea.

				CARSON
			(crosses to Colonel Lee)
		Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole
		thing. And we're knocking our heads,
		trying to find your people, just for
		show.

				WALTHER
		Carson...

				CARSON
		Let's grab a few beers, kick back
		'til five o'clock rolls by. Then
		maybe we can have a war over it. I
		think that's a great idea, seeing as
		how you fuckers have needed your
		clocks cleaned for fifty years now!



				COLONEL LEE
			(gets up)
		Why wait until five?

Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from
going at each other.

				MIRANDA
		Pete!
			(sotto)
		Christ, you're self-indulgent!
		There's nothing but anger and
		cynicism left inside you, so they're
		all you can express any more. No
		wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks
		you're such a nutcase!

				CARSON
		Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep
		around the office... "Dr. Knoll-It-
		All."

				MIRANDA

		You've been dying to tell me that...

She walks away. Carson immediately regrets saying it.

		Shit.

One of the Korean Espionage Agents answers a RINGING phone on

				ESPIONAGE AGENT
		Inspector Carson, extension 666...

				CARSON
		That's appropriate...

		In 30 seconds you're gonna give me

		Ambient background sound is normal

		How high up are they?

		No way to extrapolate that from the

		at 33.5 seconds.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson hangs up the phone.

		Okay -- high-rises in our search

				MIRANDA
		Downtown, Century City, Westwood

				CARSON
		Sabatini! What about that billboard?

				SABATINI
		Nothing yet! Everyone's left their

		LAPD will have a record of all

				MIRANDA
		And have them narrow their foot-
		searches to areas around high-rises.



				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Where's that fuckin' address?!

				DAVE
		I'm still holdin'!

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM
connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the
keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair
longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		He's on our hit parade. Interpol
		passed us his records when he
		entered the country.
			(reads)
		French by birth... looks like a total
		scumbag.

				SABATINI
		Isn't that redundant?

				DAVE
			(reads from computer)
		Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;
		served some short stretches, petty
		shit... arrested for kidnapping, no
		conviction. Did four years in France
		for blowing bank vaults. Moved to
		U.S. last year. Clean since then.

				CARSON
		Get his Driver's License number;
		Social; bank accounts; charge cards;
		club memberships... find out what
		movies he rented.  Get whoever's
		closest to the Auto Shop to get in
		there, interview everybody.

				MIRANDA
		This sure was a ballsy move for a
		car-alarm installer.

				CARSON
		Hey, he watched the news... Everyone
		knows the U.S. will do anything to
		avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.

They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard.

				MIRANDA
		Ambassador --



				CARSON
		-- Quit apologizing for me!

				MIRANDA
		Quit giving me reasons to!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Carson)
		On occasion, my wife has been known
		to kick my ankle under the table.

Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.

				CARSON
		Sounds like her aim's a little low.

Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a
piece of paper.

				DAVE
		Address, according to the Auto Shop.

				CARSON
			(looks at paper)
		Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!
		Sabatini -- you're with us.

		She's got the field experience.

Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.

				MIRANDA
		There still could be accomplices.
		If there are, they'll hear us in

Carson looks again at the address...

				CARSON
		There's a TV station a couple blocks

The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks

They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.

EXT.  K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter
lands right next to it.

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on
the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,
videotaping everything.

				CARSON
		Oh, great, the media...

		It's the goddamn traffic girl!

				MIRANDA
		Traffic person.

				BOBBI
		Where are you going?

				CARSON
		We can't get into that right now...

				BOBBI
		Hey, you expect to use my station's

Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and
crushes the tape.

				MIRANDA
			(to Bobbi)
		Sorry...



				BOBBI
			(looks Miranda over)
		What the fuck are you, the Barbie
		Corporate Ass-Lick model?

Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket
and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi
by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.

				MIRANDA
		Guess what, Sister... you're about
		to spend the next five years in a
		penitentiary for interfering with a
		federal investigation.

The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.

				STATION MANAGER
		Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their
		news blackout!

				BOBBI
			(to herself)
		Figures... you dickless wonder.

Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his
wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.

The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.

				STATION MANAGER
		I get an exclusive later, right?

				CARSON
		This works out, I'll play the

The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.

Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped

until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

				CARSON
		We're hoofing it.

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

				SABATINI
			(pissed)
		'She's got the field experience'...
		To park the fuckin' car!

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

				CARSON
			(pulls out his i.d.)
		Whoa... FBI..!

They lower their weapons.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		How the hell you get here so fast?



				SWAT TEAM #1
		They're shootin' a cop movie down
		the street. We're workin' as extras.

				CARSON
		Terrific. Who else is here?

				SWAT TEAM #1
		Three officers on the roof, next
		building over, and two in the tenth-
		floor hallway.

				CARSON
		Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
			(to Concierge)
		Give me your master key.

EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.

				SWAT TEAM #1
			(thru radio)
		Feds going up -- Anglo male and
		female; Asian male.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

				WOMAN
		What the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

				CARSON
			(to Miranda)
		Wait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
		while I look around.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

				MIRANDA
		I like what you've done with the
		place...



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

				COLONEL LEE
		Wait!

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

				SABATINI
		Where's Carson?

				COLONEL LEE
		Inside.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

				CARSON
		NO! --

Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

				CARSON
		I said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

				MIRANDA
		Stop it!

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Get out of my sight.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful
Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.

				BOBBI
			(into phone)
		Marchfelder.

				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(thru phone)
		You dated the Mayor, right?

				BOBBI
			(sighs; into phone)
		You need a traffic ticket fixed?



				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(excited; thru phone)
		Try to confirm something for us.
		There's an incredible buzz on the
		Internet -- someone picked up a

		Intelligence frequency. We think
		it's authentic!

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,
as the festivities really start rockin'.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		What's the status?

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Wilshire and West PD Divisions had
		seven vehicles running with sirens at
		9:32. They're getting the routes from
		the officers now.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Hurry it the hell up.

He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		I should've known she'd come up.

				MIRANDA
		Pete --

				CARSON
		-- "Should've." Shit, there's a
		familiar word.
			(long beat)
		That day... I was there soon enough.
		We should've rushed 'em, before they
		could finish setting up...



				MIRANDA
		The Bureau never would've let you.
		They want it by the book: talk them
		out.

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
		Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.

				MIRANDA
		You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your
		decision. You can't keep living as
		such a raw nerve, never sleeping --

				CARSON
		-- Those kids were ten years old!
			(sotto)
		Same age as the Han boy...

He turns away. She takes his hand.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we

							CUT TO:



INT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,
construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.

A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:
     
		This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated
		For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

				CARSON
		C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
		records? What about cross-referencing
		possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

				MIRANDA
		Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
			(reaches for phone)
		Where are the numbers for the
		outdoor ad companies?

				ROBBINS
		Parker Center's making those calls.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:

				BOBBI
		Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!

				CAMERAMAN
		Maybe it's true... probably is true.
		That's why they got a news blackout!

				BOBBI
		I'll rip your miserable eyeballs
		out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!

He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...A warning was radioed to U.S.
		Intelligence that a biological weapon,
		allegedly containing the deadly
		Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los
		Angeles. While unconfirmed, the
		President and other leaders are all
		late in arriving...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.

				DAVE
		Finally got the call list from
		Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
		they're from the legit user who
		didn't know his number was cloned.

				CARSON
		Go to the bottom of the list, work
		back through the last 12 hours.

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

				DAVE
		Here's the call to the Consulate --
		965-5000.
			(while scrolling)
		The rest are dupes... all from the
		other guy...

				CARSON
		Wait... go back... the one at seven
		this morning...

Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.

WIDER

Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.

(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE

from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.

(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."



BACK TO SCENE

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

				CARSON
		Get down!

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		MIRANDA!

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

				MIRANDA
		Go..!

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and
severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a
drive in the country.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and
Ambassador Han gets in.

				CARSON
		Get the fuck out of here!

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson
sighs and tears out of the driveway.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then
hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,
zooming past the snarl of cars.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs
into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson looks around at the chaos around them.

				CARSON
		Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out
		here!

Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:



				FM NEWSCASTER (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...These words, which have terrified
		the city:

				RECORDING OF BOBBI (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...A biological weapon, allegedly

Stunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his
face in his hands.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Miranda..!

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I heard. I'm in the copter.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I want you to get out of here...

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is
beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Shut up and keep your eyes on the
		road. That's my goddamn car.
			(beat; into radio)
		Dave? You staying on top of the
		research?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while
hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He
grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		I can't... My kids...

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio; calmly)
		Listen: the best way to help them is
		to stay at your computer. If any
		information comes in, holler. Okay?

He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:



				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Okay...

EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Several large military helicopters approach -- troop
contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.

The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES
and ARMY INFANTRY.

Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to
follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the
helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.

We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,
Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of
pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the
heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --
in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he
HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY

Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps
off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

				BOBBI
		Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull
		back... show the other copters around
		us... this is fuckin' great...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.



				CARSON
		...The Colonel hired Javal, made it
		look like he was working alone. Then
		he made sure Javal got killed, so
		we'd never find your family -- and
		they'd have an excuse to drop their
		bomb. But what's in it for 'em?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There are men in my government whose
		power depends on North Korea staying
		as it is: Socialist, repressive,
		isolated from the world. They'll
		resort to anything, even war, to
		keep it that way. They have the
		Hitler Syndrome: if their country
		cannot exist the way they want it,
		they would rather see it destroyed.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto
the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.

				VREELAND (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We've got the situation in hand.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into
the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.



INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper
body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable
S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.

Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel
Lee, but there's no time...

				VREELAND
			(to Pilot)
		Shit! Pull back!

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a
rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the
Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two
tons of red-hot shrapnel.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.

		Jesus fuckin' God!!!

		Uh, I think we're gonna set down
		now. Back to you, Brent.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-
mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.

Hot metal and debris PINGS and POPS as it rains over the
neighborhood, sending cars and pedestrians rushing for cover.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - DAY

Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.

				VREELAND
			(into radio)
		Out of the air, or retreat 7,000

The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.
Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming
them in an attempt to leave the city.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks
back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.

				JOY
		I always hated that guy...

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the
biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee
squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson
looks at Ambassador Han:

				CARSON
		One of yours?
			(Han nods)
		What the hell do you need heat-
		seeking rockets for in L.A.?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There could be another riot...

				CARSON
			(shakes his head)
		And they call me Mr. Overkill.
			(into radio)
		Dave, what do you know about...

He looks at Han.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Strela-2...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda has hitched a ride in a black-and-white.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Stay back. LAPD's putting up a
		roadblock.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP
BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.

They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then
stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their
huge front shovels to create a roadblock.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY

Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...

WIDER

The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.

Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a
KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...

Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY
stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the
copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:

				BOBBI
		Save it for someone who gives a
		shit!



EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.
So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.

MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and
hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking
lots.

PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and
windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,
angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.

The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.
Carson catches up to it.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to
		arm, so stay tight on his ass.

Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han
braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.



				CARSON
		That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses
		you'd like to tell me about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I don't think so -- they said it was
		solid as a rock.

				CARSON
			(looks at his crumpled car)
		No shit...

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(dazed)
		I can't believe I'm still alive...

				CARSON
		This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

				CARSON
		Get me out of here...

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Anybody see him?

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Still heading north on the 110.

The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador
Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

		Dave... You're sure those rockets
		are heat-seeking?

				DAVE (VO)

Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking
for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		This is Carson. I need a copter.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY

Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard,
Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy.

				CARSON (VO)

		Something small and nimble.
		Anybody... come in low, from the

		Are you out of your mind?

INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the
minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her
Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs
the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:



				BOBBI
		Get this fuckin' thing in the air!
			(to Cameraman)
		Out! Not enough room for four.

				CAMERAMAN
			(as they TAKE OFF)
		What am I supposed to do when the
		plague comes, hold my breath?

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

They rapidly cut through the traffic.

		I'll make him open the sunroof.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		No way. I couldn't stand making so

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.

				CARSON
		You?! I wanted a police copter!

				PILOT
		Just tell me what to do. I flew two
		tours in 'Nam.



				BOBBI
		And he doesn't go unless I go!

				CARSON
		Wrong-o...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!

WIDER

They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.
Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

BOBBI

surfaces, sputtering and screaming:

				BOBBI
		I'm a respected electronic
		journalist, you fuckin' prick!!

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of
Mylanta out after her.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

In the distance, there is smog on the horizon.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes
cutting across lanes.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Got 'im -- looks like he's headed
		for the 101.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.



				CARSON
			(to Pilot)
		Pull hard to the left, on my
		signal...

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

				CARSON
		Now!

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda sees what Carson is doing.

				MIRANDA
		You fucking lunatic!!

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The News Pilot looks over at Carson.

				PILOT
		Hope you got more flares than he's
		got rockets.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...



EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

VARIOUS ANGLES

As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.



				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

				MIRANDA
		You're completely deranged! Playing
		chicken with rockets!

				CARSON
		Well, what the hell were you doing
		out there?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		What are both of you doing?

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

				CARSON
		Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.

				MIRANDA
		Even if we can pry him out with...
			(looks at her watch)
		Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
		be very cooperative.

				CARSON
		I'll just use my outstanding people
		skills.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Ambassador
			Han)
		That car's like a rock, right?

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.



INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY

Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

CLOSER

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.



				MIRANDA
		Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
		Well, these are fuck you pumps!
			(pushes harder)
		Where's the family?

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on
his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.

				DAVE
		Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned
		into Dirty Harriet!

He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.

				DAVE
			(continuing; into phone)
		You're sure there were no accounts in
		the other names I gave you?

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Let him up.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

				COLONEL LEE
		Victory!

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

WIDER

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.



EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

Ahead, in the distance, the coastline comes into view.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family stares at the TV. Mrs. Han purses her lips...

Carson reaches for his two-way radio.

				CARSON

Dave is looking at the TV, paying no attention to his
computer.

Shaking his head, Dave glances at his computer...

Just in time to glimpse the words "First & Last + Deposit" on

fumbles to scroll back to the check.

We PULL BACK... they're way up in a high-rise building... The
CAMERA continues to PULL BACK, farther and farther...

story towers standing side-by-side in a series of hexagons.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

The dense Assistant Manager, MILTON, stands in the outer
office, staring at the inner office's closed door.

				MILTON

During this, outside:

				WESTEC GUARDS (OS)

		Tenants -- leave your apartments at

Carson sticks the radio in his pocket and looks at Miranda.

		"Fuck-you" pumps??

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The hostages can hear the WHOOPING fire alarms and the (OS)
ANNOUNCEMENT. Joy looks at Mrs. Han, hopeful.

				JOY
		They must know we're here...

				ALL
		Help!

No answer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on
the complex from all directions.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

				VOICE THRU PA
		Han family. Show us your location...

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

				JOY
		Mother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

				MRS. HAN
		Do it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.

				MILTON
		It's a brown binder... Says "Rental
		Manifest." You can't miss it...

They literally tear the office apart.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Apartment number would be real
		helpful, gang...

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

				MIRANDA
		There!

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The coast looms closer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

				CARSON
		Okay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

				LISA
		Hurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

				CARSON
		DON'T!

He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		We have to go out the window.

				MRS. HAN
		Can't you disarm the bomb?



				CARSON
		Too risky. Let's concentrate on
		getting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Sound detectors?

				MRS. HAN
		Sam covered them with chewing gum.

				SAM
		High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

				CARSON
		Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
		convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
		seat, he sets the alarm off. These
		are rigged backwards -- get up, you
		set 'em off.

				SAM
		You a bomb expert?

				CARSON
		Nope. But I've had some car alarms
		in my day.
			(to himself)
		For all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
		Slide your arm forward... Watch the
		meter... Keep the pressure on the
		armrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
		the weight of your arm... Okay...
		pick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



				CARSON
			(continuing; to Sam)
		Low-tech solution...
			(to Mrs. Han)
		Lean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio in his pocket)
		How's it going in there?

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Nag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making
an incredible racket.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

WIDER

The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

				CARSON
		You'll be over in five seconds...

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.

ANGLE ON BOMB

One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

CARSON

sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.
Han into it...

				CARSON
		Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook
		and ride down on the line.

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

ANGLE ON BOMB

Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

THE HARNESS

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

				CARSON
			(shouts)
		Release the cable from your side!
		Get out of here!

				MIRANDA
			(shouts back)
		Come over the railing! Grab onto the

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.

All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

CARSON

is engulfed in the FIREBALL... We can't tell if he's alive.

INT./EXT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.

Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

		Told 'em I'd sleep on it...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

				MIRANDA
		Working with you today was

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

				MIRANDA
		I hate this fucking town...

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...

A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
     
				Consulate
				 of the
		Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY

From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

BACK TO SCENE

The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

NEW ANGLE

The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

				SAM
		I can't stand it -- half an hour to
		get to the stupid school every
		morning... with no music...
			(Korean; subtitled)
		[Just our damn Nanny...]

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS

Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

WIDER

Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

				DRIVER
			(Korean)
		[Stay in the car.]



EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY

Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

ANGLE WITH JAVAL

as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

							FADE TO:



EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY

Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

							CUT TO:

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

				CARSON
		Son of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

				MIRANDA
		Pete... please... we have to be up
		early tomorrow. Call the police.



				CARSON
		Yeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Shit!

MIRANDA

pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

				MIRANDA
		Not again...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

NEW ANGLE

Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

				WESTEC GUARD
		Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
		the ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

				CARSON
		Asshole was trying to boost my car!

ANGLE ACROSS STREET

Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

				CARSON
		Mike -- call 911!

				NEIGHBOR
		Been trying...
			(has a cordless phone)
		It's busy.
			(to Guards; re Carson)
		He's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

CLOSER

Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

				JOY
		There are six bathrooms in this
		house, Sam.

				SAM
			(fanning the air)
		But only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(Korean)
		[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing)
		[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

				MRS. HAN
		It's the Governess...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Hilda...

CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS

as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

				GOVERNESS
			(thru phone)
		Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY

				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We will see you next week...
			(hangs up; smiles to kids)
		It appears I'll be taking you to
		school.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

				JAVAL
		Very good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY

Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

ANGLE ON TV

A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
		gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
		July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
		rolled into one! All over town
		there'll be parades, concerts,
		rallies, festivals... So get out
		there everyone, but plan your drive-
		time accordingly! This is Bobbi
		Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

				MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
			(on TV)
		The President is on his way...

				PRESIDENT
			(on TV)
		...It's an honor hosting my fellow
		leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
		city of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

				MORNING ANCHOR
			(on TV)
		We'll see the menu for Mayor
		Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
		after this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

BACK TO SCENE

As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

				MIRANDA
		I was watching that.

				CARSON
		If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
		I'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

				CARSON
			(continuing; while smiling)
		I said, if we were having sex once in
		a while, you wouldn't need to ride
		that fucking bike every morning.



				MIRANDA
			(hasn't heard a thing)
		Be right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY

Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

				MIRANDA
			(looks him over)
		Have you gotten any sleep lately?

				CARSON
			(ignores the question)
		Shop's gonna tow the car in --
		goddamn ignition's trashed.

				MIRANDA
		Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

				CARSON
		You ask me, those suckers are a lost
		cause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

				MIRANDA
		It's not for you.

				CARSON
		You mean it's not for you.

				MIRANDA
		I don't chase car thieves in my
		underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
		boredom if we ever sold this house
		and moved.



				CARSON
		I'd die of shock, from finding
		anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
		Even for what it's worth now.

				MIRANDA
		Lots of people bought at the top of
		the market...

				CARSON
		That sure cheers me right up.

				MIRANDA
		I don't know why we even talk about
		it. The city's not the problem. So
		we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
		that saying: "Wherever you go, there
		you are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		I hope you're current on your
		tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

				CARSON
		One cut... two assholes in the
		hospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Well, another day of baby-sitting my
		favorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

				MIRANDA
		Ask for a transfer.

				CARSON
		They're not gonna transfer me. You
		know damn well why I was bumped down
		to guard duty...
			(as he's leaving)
		My outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY

A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
SWEARING:

				ANGRY VOICE (OS)
		Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
		shit...

THEIR POV

In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

JOY

turns to Mrs. Han:

				JOY
		Can we give Lisa a ride?

INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY

It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

				LISA
		Hey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



				LISA
			(continuing)
		Excellent -- I can't hear him!

				SAM
			(raps on window)
		The glass is an inch thick.
			(points to doors, roof)
		Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
		proof.

				LISA
		Perfect car for L.A.
			(looks back at her Dad)
		Starts, too.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES

where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler & Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.



				ROBBINS
		Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
		escaped the office!

				DAVE
		I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
		a chance to hose out my cage.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

				ROBBINS
		Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

				SABATINI
		"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
		call him.
			(yawns; flops in a chair)
		Friggin' graveyard shift...

				ROBBINS
		Love to know what dope made it the
		Bureau's job to give full-time
		protection to foreign consulates.
			(offers coffee to Dave)
		Cup a mud?

				DAVE
		Not if you made it. Why don't you
		get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
		the alleged chick.

				SABATINI
		Blow me.

				DAVE
		Where's Carson?

				SABATINI
		On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
		off his Mustang last night.
			(beat; solemnly)
		They cut the ragtop.

				DAVE
		Motherfuckers...

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.



				DAVE
			(continuing)
		Latest and greatest. Wireless
		network link-ups.

				SABATINI
		Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

				ROBBINS
		Me, too.

				DAVE
		Ingrates.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY

The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME

Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



INSERT

Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

WIDER

The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



				JAVAL
		You see that I'm serious in my
		intention, yes?
			(she nods)
		If you cooperate, you and your
		children will be home for dinner
		tonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

				COLONEL LEE
			(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
		[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Someone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



				SABATINI
		You got no jurisdiction outside
		this property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

				SABATINI
			(continuing)
		Shit!
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Yank his fuckin' leash!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		My men are going!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(continuing; to Sabatini)
		It's a white telephone van, driving
		west on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

				ROBBINS
		Keys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

				SABATINI
		You're ridin' shotgun.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

				ROBBINS
		Cherry?

				DAVE
		Under the seat.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

				ROBBINS
		Siren?

				DAVE
		I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
		hurry..!



EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

				SABATINI
		Someone snatched Han's family! White
		phone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

				CARSON
		Give me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

				CO-WORKER
		Someone's been to Nordstroms, big
		time.

				WALTHER
		Clothes make the man.

				CO-WORKER
		But does the man make enough for the
		clothes?

				WALTHER
			(smiles)
		The man makes payments on his Visa.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.



				SECRETARY
		Mr. Walther... priority line!

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
		Walther... What's the nature of your
		emer --
			(grimaces)
		Aw, Jesus... not today...
			(beat)
		I'll inform channels and get a copter
		in the air. For God's sake, keep it
		quiet. Do what you can, but don't
		endanger civilians or the family!

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		You bet -- nice and easy.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY

Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Get the Secretary of State on the
		horn.
			(listens)
		I know he left already. I'm familiar
		with the concept of time zones. Find
		his ass.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson turns the frequency on his two-way.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on
		its way.

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.



INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Think it's them?

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll
		move up; he won't suspect a civilian
		car. Stay back, then get on his ass
		when I signal. We'll box him in.

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		If the Mod Squad gets in your way,
		don't be shy about getting 'em out.

				SABATINI (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Copy that one.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S CAR - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Glaring, Colonel Lee looks over at the FBI cars as they pass.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

				SABATINI
		Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

HIS POV

As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



JAVAL

grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

				JAVAL
		I need to concentrate!

EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

NEW ANGLE

The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY

Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS

The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's gonna wrap it around something!

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



NEW ANGLE

Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

				COLONEL LEE
		You should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

				CARSON
		I'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

				ROBBINS
		Forget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY

A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY

Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing
that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.



				CARSON
		Let's get back to the Consulate.

Off their perplexed looks, we

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

				JAVAL
		Does anyone need to use the rest
		room? This will be your last
		opportunity for a few hours.
			(no takers)
		Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy,
		please sit here.
			(indicates the Lazy Boys;
			then turns to Lisa)
		And you... what is your name?

				LISA
			(after a beat)
		Lisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

				JAVAL
		No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

				JAVAL
			(continuing; sotto)
		You afford me some additional
		bargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		There. No taping your mouths, no
		restraints. Please remain still
		while I explain. The meters on the
		left indicate sound pressure --
		Decibels. There are microphones on
		your chair backs. If you raise your
		voices above certain level, putting
		your meter in the red zone for more
		than one sustained second, the
		circuit will be closed.
			(beat)
		The right meters indicate motion.
		There are pressure sensors inside the
		armrests and seats. The sensors don't
		like to get wet, so I hope you were
		honest about not needing to use the
		loo. If you make any excess
		movements, or try to leave your
		chair, the circuit will be closed.

				MRS. HAN
		I don't understand...

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

				MRS. HAN
			(continuing; softly)
		What happens if the circuit closes?

				JAVAL
		Kaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Easy... deep breath...
			(to the kids)
		Do each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

				JAVAL
			(continuing)
		Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(on TV)
		...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
		whole city had an such an opportunity --

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

				WALTHER
		Carson?
			(Carson nods)
		Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

				CARSON
		His Security Chief.
			(beat)
		There was a civilian with them --
		fifteen-year-old girl from across
		the street. We're trying to reach
		the parents.

				WALTHER
		Goddamn it...
			(sotto)
		Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
		Premier's niece! We're hearing
		rumors they're gonna make a major
		issue out of what happened here...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

				CARSON
		I'm not so sure what happened here.
		Something smells. Asshole was acting
		like he wanted us to spot him...



				WALTHER
		What the hell are you talking about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		Mr. Walther?

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.

				WALTHER
		Ambassador Han... my deepest --

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		-- I have no wish for condolences.
		Just answers.

				WALTHER
		As soon as we have any to give...

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		Yoon..?!

				CARSON
			(to FBI agents)
		Start a trace!

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

				WALTHER
			(into phone)
		Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Carson; incensed)
		You are tapping our phones?!

				CARSON
			(while crossing to
			Ambassador Han)
		Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
		Streep.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.



				MRS. HAN
			(into phone)
		We are not hurt. But this man is
		very serious --

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

				JAVAL
			(into phone)
		I want you to remember the feeling
		you had when you thought your family
		was dead, and use it to inform the
		choices you're about to make.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

				CARSON
		Say you want to talk to the kids...

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(into phone)
		I need to know my children are all
		right.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Be in front of a television in two
		minutes. Tune it to channel four.
		You'll get the picture.

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There is a television in my office.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're screwed on the trace -- he's
		on a cell phone.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

				DAVE
		Play the tape back. I might be able
		to pull the electronic serial number
		out of the subcarrier.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Ask Dave if he knows how to find the
		phone's serial number.

				ROBBINS
			(smiles; into radio)
		Hey, great idea...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

ANGLE ON TV

It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

CLOSER

There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE

It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

				CARSON (OS)
		Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
			(beat)
		Look at the TV -- this was just
		taken.

BACK TO SCENE

A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.



				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		There must surely be several people
		in the room; you may put me on the
		speakerbox if you wish.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

				JAVAL (VO)
			(continuing; thru
			speakerbox)
		I am not a terrorist. Your
		countries' political posturing means
		nothing to me. So do not waste time
		trying to negotiate.
			(beat)
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
		Angeles can furnish ten million
		dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
		required denominations are in the
		instructions, as is the method of
		packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
		PM, and drive north on Highland
		Avenue. I will call with where to
		leave the money, which you will do
		at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
		call again at 4:00 with the family's
		location and the method for removing
		them from their... predicament.
		Could you please refer to page one?
			(they look at the photo)
		Any deviation from these instructions
		and my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Walther)
		P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

				WALTHER
		Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
		Negotiator is on the way --

				CARSON
		-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
		thing we need! This asshole sound
		like he was interested in bargaining?

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:


				WALTHER
		We have people who are experts in
		these situations. We really feel it
		would be best if you let them
		coordinate everything...

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

				WALTHER
			(continuing; to Carson)
		Let's get on it...

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

				CARSON
		...You're gonna just pay up, count
		on his good nature to return the
		family?!

				WALTHER
		It's the President's intention to
		keep this quiet, move forward with
		the Summit, and work with the North
		Koreans. Jesus, you've already
		embarrassed the shit out of us over
		the phone surveillance --

				CARSON
		-- They know their phones are tapped!
		They tap our fucking phones!

				WALTHER
		That's not the point! The point is
		not acknowledging it!
			(beat)
		We got an international incident
		brewing, with a country we were
		practically at war with last year!
		Our best Negotiator is gonna run
		point. If you got a problem, you can
		take the goddamn rest of the day off.

				CARSON
		This Consulate is my responsibility.

				WALTHER
		Not any more.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.



				WALTHER
			(continuing)
		That's the Negotiator. You do the
		briefing.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

				CARSON
		...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
		There are events gearing up all
		around town, and a dozen world
		leaders arriving. Add the Friday
		rush hour and usual L.A. bad
		behavior and it'll be a nightmare
		out there by 3 PM. It all works to
		the advantage of the kidnapper,
		hinders our pursuit efforts...
			(frowns)
		You don't agree?

WIDER


The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.


It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.

				MIRANDA
		I'm wondering whether to believe him
		when he says he's strictly motivated
		by money.

				CARSON
			(grabs faxes back)
		You see one word of Peoples'-
		Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
		whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
		this-week bullshit in this entire
		letter?

				MIRANDA
		I still want to check the MO against
		known politicals, terrorists --



				CARSON
		-- Already doing it. We're
		coordinating with the Secret
		Service, the NSA and the CIA.

				MIRANDA
		Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
		them a cover story for the media
		about the crash on La Cienega.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

				WALTHER
		Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
		is your wife?!

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

				CARSON
			(while looking at Miranda)
		If she'd changed her name when we
		got married, I wouldn't have to.

				MIRANDA
			(to Carson)
		I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
		finally work together...

				WALTHER
		Jesus, forget I asked.
			(beat)
		The cash will be here in an hour.
			(to Miranda)
		Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
		thoughts?

				MIRANDA
		Everything indicates he's working
		alone. And his concerns do seem to
		be solely about the money... so I
		agree that he's only using the
		Summit and the tension with North
		Korea to create extreme motivation
		to pay the ransom.

				COLONEL LEE
		I will bring the money to him.

				CARSON
		My ass.

				COLONEL LEE
		The hostages are citizens of the
		People's Republic of Korea --

				CARSON
		-- Hey, do I go to the torture
		chambers in your prisons, tell you
		how to do your job?

				WALTHER
		All right, you're outta here! Is
		this the same insubordinate crap you
		pulled at Beverly Thrift?

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

				CARSON
		I'll coordinate the drop.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Perhaps that is better. Inspector
		Carson knows the terrain --

				COLONEL LEE
		-- Then he can come with me.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

				WALTHER
			(firm; to Carson)
		It's settled.

				CARSON
		It sucks.

				MIRANDA
		But it means we can get on with it.

The Americans leave the room.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY

Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

				MIRANDA
			(sotto)
		Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
		If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
		Beverly Thrift never would've
		happened.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

				JAVAL
		That's more like it...

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY

In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

				OPERATIVE
			(into uplink device)
		...They've got the Premier agreeing
		to the hard-line position --

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

				OPERATIVE
			(continuing; sotto)
		More to follow...

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

				DAVE
		I wanted to be home by now, take the
		kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

				SABATINI
		We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
		L.A. was supposed to be a brown
		blotch in the rear-view mirror.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

				MIRANDA
		He'll expect a homing device --

				CARSON
		-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
		check the cash with an RF detector...
			(re larger transmitter)
		Meaning he'll find this one.
			(re smaller transmitter)
		This only has a quarter-mile range,
		but on a frequency too low to detect.
			(turns off receiver)
		And I doubt the asshole will have an
		X-ray machine or a metal detector.

				MIRANDA
		Why must you always refer generically
		to criminals as "assholes?"

				CARSON
		Gosh, you're right. It could
		undermine their self-esteem and spoil
		their chances for rehabilitation.

	
				MIRANDA
		You been reading my magazines in the
		bathroom again?

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru recorder)
		"And my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

				MIRANDA
		He's really exhibiting pressured
		speech... big effort here to sound
		calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
		he were in control, he wouldn't feel
		such a need to sound that way.

				CARSON
		Just tell me if we can use it.

				MIRANDA
		If we needle him he could get sloppy
		and give us an opening, but I'm not
		going to risk it. This is the worst
		kind of perpetrator: anything makes
		him deviate from his carefully-
		scripted plan, he could become
		extremely volatile.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Do we have back-up if the bleeper
		fails?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru headphones)
		Nothing but physical surveillance.

INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

				MIRANDA
		It's real important we don't lose
		him. He didn't go through all the
		trouble of designing that bomb not
		to use it.

Carson looks at her as the thought of it hits him.



				CARSON
		Well, it ain't gonna happen.
			(beat; sotto)
		Not again...

EXT.  WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The National Security Council: VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARIES OF
DEFENSE, STATE, CHIEFS of the FBI, CIA and NSA -- sit
nervously around a table, facing a video conferencing setup.
The President, in Air Force One, APPEARS on it.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell is the big crisis?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		We just received a missive from the
		North Korean attachÈ. They say the
		kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
		and humiliate them during the Summit.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Bullshit. They're just ticked because
		we don't want the Chinese dragging
		their asses into the treaty talks.

The SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER refers to his notes.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		We have a covert operative in place.
		He reports the hard-liners and
		moderates in the High Command are
		arguing about how to respond, should
		the Premier's niece and her children
		should be killed.

				PRESIDENT
			(scowls; thru video link)
		Respond?! Christ. What about the
		damn Premier?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		He's weak. He has to look tough to
		save face, keep control of hard-
		liners... otherwise he risks a coup.

				CIA CHIEF
		Which is a real possibility. Most of
		those old-fart Generals don't want to
				-more-

				CIA CHIEF (Cont'd)
		be part of the Summit any more than
		we want them to. They're mad as hell
		he even talked to the Chinese.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't want to deal with this right
		now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell
		the North we'll pay the ransom for
		'em... Placate 'em! And make damn
		sure we get that family back in one
		piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?

				FBI CHIEF
		The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack
		team in place.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		There's a Diplomatic Liaison from
		State, too.

				CIA CHIEF
			(to FBI Chief)
		What about your man stationed at the
		Consulate...
			(refers to notes)
		Carson? He was demoted from the FBI
		Hostage Program, couple years back.
		And this did happen on his watch...

				FBI CHIEF
			(irritated)
		There's no way he could've prevented
		this abduction! Besides, I've got one
		of my top Negotiators in charge --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- Whatever. I want a total news
		blackout and I want this over with,
		quickly! Without giving those Commie
		little bastards any excuse to shit
		all over my Summit!

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the
driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is
already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is
completely in the car.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town
is all done up with posters and banners.

Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an
unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda, Ambassador Han, and Lisa's father (the cussing Jag
Owner) wait by the phone. Miranda smiles reassuringly at the
two nervous fathers. The phone RINGS; she picks it up.

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		Yes, please go ahead...

				JAVAL (VO)
			(long beat; thru phone)
		Ah... this must be one of those
		professionals --

				MIRANDA
			(into phone)
		-- I'm only here to see that
		everyone gets what they want --

				JAVAL (VO)
			(thru phone)
		-- I've got my shotgun in little
		Lisa's mouth, and I will pull the
		trigger in five seconds unless you
		put the Ambassador on the phone.

Miranda hands the phone to Ambassador Han.

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

From the two-way radio in Carson's pocket:

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		The drop is at the DeMille barn,
		across from the Hollywood Bowl.
		You're to leave the money in the
		center of the parking lot.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Shit... no way we can set up a stake-
		out in...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(checks watch)
		Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers
		at the Bowl. Have them clear the
		area of civilians.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Remember, Pete... we're dealing with
		a customer with a lot of rage.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Must've bought a house same time we
		did.

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland
near Hollywood Blvd.

Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising
around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.

A BIKER CLUB

of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn
from the Boulevard onto Highland.

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood
Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a
sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."

INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.

Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.

INT.  MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee grabs the two large plastic bags full of money
from the back seat, opens his door, and drops them onto the
pavement. Carson looks around.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		There's about a hundred ways he can
		scurry off like a cockroach from
		here... So spread out.

Colonel Lee checks their BEEPING homing receiver. Carson hangs
a left onto Highland, going back the way he came.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Dave holds their homing receiver. Sabatini, behind the wheel,
smacks his arm and points ahead:

EXT.  DEMILLE BARN - DAY

Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above
the bags of money.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream
		truck!

EXT.  ODIN STREET - DAY

Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.

INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY

Javal, sweating and shaking, quickly runs a metal-detector
wand over each of the individual bags of money. One of them
makes the speaker in the wand handle WHINE.

INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - INCLUDE POV OF DEMILLE BARN - DAY

The van pulls away.

Dave glances at the homing receiver. The signal isn't moving.
He looks up...

Two of the small bags of money are sitting on the pavement.

				DAVE
		Son of a bitch!
			(into radio)
		He found the bleepers -- both of
		them!

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like
		he'll be hard to see in that truck.
		Which way's he heading?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Toward the freeway.

Carson hangs a U-turn.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,
Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		What happened?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We're made! Gotta grab him!

				MIRANDA
			(beat; into radio)
		All right... Carefully...

INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.

				CARSON
		Watch it! We need him alive!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.

				COLONEL LEE
		Turn around!

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

				CARSON
		FBI. Call our office, they'll take
		care of you.

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

				BIKER
		I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
		dentist!

COLONEL LEE

gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

WIDER

When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

				CARSON
		Just don't kill yourself, you piece
		of shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Helicopter or two would be nice!

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Love to be in the loop on this...

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Not just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

				CARSON
			(continuing; grumbling)
		I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
		horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

JAVAL

speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		He's on foot, at the base of the
		elevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

CLOSER

From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

BEHIND CARSON

the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

NEW ANGLE

Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

				CARSON
		Fingerprint it.
			(to Walther)
		He's not gonna tell us where to find
		the hostages...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(looks at watch)
		Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
		figure it out for ourselves.

				WALTHER
		Figure it out?! With what?!

				CARSON
			(ignores him; into radio)
		Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
			(to Robbins)
		Get back to his van. There were no
		plates, but check the VIN, look it
		over, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Go!

							CUT TO:

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		...Scrounge us some bodies: National
		Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
		PD's, meter maids --

				WALTHER
		-- They're gonna search the whole
		city in a goddamn hour..?!

				CARSON
		Look, I don't need you to tell me
		how fucked we are!

				WALTHER
		Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
		case something explodes!

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

				MIRANDA
		Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
		is a luxury we can't afford!
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
			(looks at Carson)
		What's done is done. There'll be
		plenty of time to point fingers
		later.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

				SABATINI
		I need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		This is impossible! How can you even
		begin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

				MIRANDA
		Well, the normal procedure is to
		negotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

				CARSON
		Let's take stock. We've got a picture
		of where he hid the family, and
		recordings of his calls --

				MIRANDA
		-- That's right! We can send them to
		our experts for analysis...

				CARSON
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Same with his fingerprints. But that
		means we need high-quality image and
		data transmission. We can piss away
		ten minutes coptering this shit to
		our offices in Westwood, or we can
		use your surveillance equipment.

				COLONEL LEE
		There is no surveillance equipment.
		This is a diplomatic facility --

				CARSON
		-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Take them upstairs.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

				CARSON
		South Korean Consulate's just down
		the street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

				CARSON
			(continuing; re hand)
		Shitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
		Got a digital scanner?

				COLONEL LEE
		Analog.

				CARSON
			(looks equipment over)
		You might want to drop a few bucks at
		Radio Shack and get with the decade.
			(into radio)
		Dave -- get in here. Bring your
		computer, a city map, and the tapes
		of the ransom calls.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		On my way...

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



				MIRANDA
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
		him to the Ambassador, see if it's
		anyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
		of prints coming over. Narrow the
		search criteria: Male, thirties,
		Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
		maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and
		bombers first. We need an answer in
		fifteen minutes.

EXT.  HOOVER BUILDING, WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

FBI headquarters, with the Washington Monument in the b.g.

INT.  HOOVER BUILDING - FINGERPRINT LAB - DAY

A TECHNICIAN, wearing thick glasses, sits in front of a high-
resolution computer monitor.

		That yellow air out there finally
		rot your brain?! It's impossible!

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru phone)
		Dazzle me.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

				CARSON
			(to Walther)
		We got one of the best sound guys
		right here in town...
			(into phone)
		Newman in Audio Analysis...

				DAVE (OS)
		Newman's gone.

WIDER

Dave comes into the room.



				DAVE
		He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
		bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

				DAVE
			(continuing; looks around)
		Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
		to see the fight tonight.

				CARSON
		Get those tapes transferred to a
		sound guy. We need ambient and
		background analysis, the whole
		enchilada.

				DAVE
		Enchilada -- you saying that because
		I'm Mexican?

				CARSON
		No... 'cause you're fat.

				MIRANDA
			(picks up Javal's fax)
		Photo enhancement... Isn't there
		some amazing tech with the LAPD --

				DAVE
		-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
		PD a month ago.

				CARSON
		Jesus H. Christ...

				SABATINI
		I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
		earn their keep.

				CARSON
		Do it.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.

				MIRANDA
		Given his behavior, this orange
		residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
		Amphetamines.

				CARSON
		Any significance?



				MIRANDA
		It's consistent with the lone wolf
		scenario: A handful of these is pure
		bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
		psychosis and paranoia kick in.
			(beat)
		We could check pharmacy records, on
		the remote chance he got them
		legally... if we had a couple of
		weeks, that is.

				CARSON
			(to Sabatini)
		Get the Bureau on it.

				MIRANDA
		Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

				CARSON
		Look, goddammit, you start skipping
		no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
		quit and go to the beach right now.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
		last certain visual we had was just
		before his van went into the alley
		on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
		Consulate at 9:30.

				MIRANDA
		That gives him about fifty minutes
		to get to his location, move and
		secure the hostages, and activate
		his time bomb.

				CARSON
		He probably waited a while to pad
		the time -- he wanted us know the
		family was still alive...
			(sotto; re Koreans)
		...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
		throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
		but he didn't want to call too soon,
		either. I say they're within 15 to
		20 minutes, via surface streets, of
		where we last saw them.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.



				MIRANDA
		The most densely-populated part of
		the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
		to about 200,000 dwellings.

A beat while this sinks in.

				MIRANDA
			(continuing)
		He was traveling west --

				CARSON
		-- Bet he doubled back.

				MIRANDA
		C'mon, that's total conjecture --

				SABATINI
			(re Carson)
		-- I'd trust his instincts when
		dealing with maniacs. He is deeply
		disturbed.

				MIRANDA
		You're telling me?

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
		accusing us of botching the ransom
		drop on purpose.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They're still harping on that
		"American plot" nonsense.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Meaning?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		They say the death of the Premier's
		niece and her family would justify
		immediate retaliation.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
		What kind of retaliation?

Everyone in the room looks at one another.



				CIA CHIEF
		They're threatening to pull a Saddam
		Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
		at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
			(beat)
		They're talking about firing a
		missile into Los Angeles --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- A goddamn WHAT??

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
		cruise -- their version of our
		Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
		find the city, but it's not too
		accurate beyond that.

				VICE PRESIDENT
		Still, for their purposes it's
		perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
		out a city block or two...

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		To the eyes of the world it's a
		measured response -- like what Reagan
		did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
		at an American city would be a huge
		psychological victory for them.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I don't believe I'm hearing this!
			(beat)
		So if we know it's coming, we can
		knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		These weapons fly subsonically, below
		radar... we don't have the defenses
		in place... If we'd had the time to
		deploy a string of Patriot anti-
		missile batteries across the coast --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		-- You're saying we got all this
		lousy hardware and can't stop one
		goddamn missile??

Everyone's silence answers his question.



				PRESIDENT
			(continuing; thru video
			link)
		I want an immediate search for all
		ships within range.

				FBI CHIEF
		We better inform the other leaders,
		stall on the Summit --

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		There's no reason to panic yet --
		they can't launch until after the
		family's confirmed dead!

				CIA CHIEF
		Afraid that's not the case...

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The North Korean Premier holds what
		we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
		able to destroy a missile in flight,
		right up to the moment before it
		achieves its target.

				CIA CHIEF
		Our Op says they've timed their
		retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

				FBI CHIEF
		And if the family turns up okay,
		they'll just make it self-destruct.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Shit! I really don't need this today!

				VICE PRESIDENT
		We're forgetting one thing here: the
		family. Intelligence is sure the
		North will abort their attack if Mrs.
		Han and her kids are safely returned?

				CIA CHIEF
		Absolutely. Their whole game depends
		on claiming a legitimate provocation.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Still, we should let them know there'd
		be a response... if it comes to it.



				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'd like to turn 'em into a
		radioactive parking lot.

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		That's the problem: we can't. We're
		the last superpower. Our hands are
		tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
		stacks of treaties... most we could
		do is give 'em a "measured response"
		back again, or everyone starts
		crying that we're the bullies.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
		wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
		stunt like this.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Believe me, the North drops one in
		my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in
		theirs. Get some bombers in the air.
		And don't tell me any more bad news!

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins stands by Javal's van, on the shoulder of the freeway.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Cute.
			(to Miranda)
		He signed the name of the Allied
		Commander during the Korean War.
		Maybe he was a political.

				MIRANDA
		No. The phony ice cream truck, the
		booby-trapped chairs... he could've
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
		done it without half that stuff. But
		this was going to be the score of a
		lifetime... he was showing off.

				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Who's got those kinds of skills:
		Electronics, vehicle customizing,
		computers, explosives?

				DAVE
		Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your
		average high-school student if
		they're so inclined. My guess is our
		perp used off-the-shelf equipment
		for everything except the C-4, and
		that's only slightly harder to get
		than crack or heroin, if you know
		who to ask.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi looks into the TV camera, dripping with sincerity.

				BOBBI
		This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye

The red light on the camera goes off. Bobbi turns to the Pilot.



				BOBBI
			(continuing; furious)
		Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that
		entire segment!
			(as if to a child)
		Keep... the sun... to my left!!

The Cameraman and the Pilot sigh at each other.

				BOBBI
			(continuing)
		What's new on the kidnapping rumor?

				CAMERAMAN
		Nada. Total news blackout.

				BOBBI
		Go back over the hill.

				NEWS PILOT
		We got the valley traffic report in
		fifteen --

				BOBBI
		-- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed!
		Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!

She takes an industrial-sized bottle of Mylanta out of her
purse. It's fitted with a water-bottle DRINKING SPOUT. She
takes a huge swig and grimaces.

				BOBBI
			(continuing; to Cameraman)
		What are you lookin' at? I was the
		morning anchor in Houston! And I'm

The Han family sits in their booby-trapped chairs. Joy
carefully turns to her mother.

		What if something goes wrong?

				MRS. HAN
			(firmly)
		It won't.



INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Carson grabs his FBI blazer off the back of a chair.

				CARSON
		I'm going to the kidnapping site.

				MIRANDA
		I want to talk to the witnesses.

Colonel Lee also heads for the door. Carson looks at him.

				CARSON
		Great, we'll hire a bus.

They leave. Dave, meanwhile, paces, phone in hand.

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.

We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some
Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.



INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - DAY

Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.

Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote-
control boxes. He picks up his radio.

				ROBBINS
			(into radio)
		A lot of the components are made by

		security company.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Jump a copter to the Consulate. See
		if the manufacturer sells to the
		public. Find out what shops use their
		stuff; put people on the phones with
		a description of the perp.

EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

NEW ANGLE

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.

				YOUNG COP
		Inspector! Look at this...
			(reads from shell)
		"Dragon's Breath..?"



				CARSON
		Twelve-gauge shell filled with
		magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's
		worse than napalm -- Geneva
		Convention outlawed it for warfare.

				MIRANDA
		Then how did he get it?

				CARSON
		Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.
			(looks around)
		Where's the Consulate's car?

				YOUNG COP
			(beat)
		Uh... apparently it was stolen...

				COLONEL LEE
		Stolen!? What is it with you
		people --

				YOUNG COP
			(angry)
		-- What's this "you people" shit?

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Shut up!

				MIRANDA
			(aside; to Young Cop)
		He means all of us "you people."

				CARSON
			(to Young Cop)
		Find it! How many bulletproof
		Mercedes could be cruising around
		Crenshaw?

				YOUNG COP
		You'd be surprised...

				CARSON
		I hate this fuckin' town.

INT./EXT.  FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Ambassador Han, Walther and Sabatini are looking at a series
of high-definition faxes spread out on a table.

Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.

				CARSON
		Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was
		working alone, and he was a vicious
		son of a bitch. Old news.

				COLONEL LEE
			(to Ambassador Han)
		And our car was stolen.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I felt safer when I was the
		Ambassador to Libya.

				SABATINI
		Image enhancements came back.

POV OF PICTURES

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

				CARSON
		We going steady?



				SABATINI
		The sun position tells us the
		windows are facing northeast.
			(beat)
		Here's the best -- look at the glass
		on the prints hanging in the
		background. There's a reflection of
		a reflection, out on the street: the
		corner of a billboard.

				CARSON
		Looks like the wheel of a car.

				MIRANDA
		We talked about these billboards,
		when we were car shopping! Four-
		door... they make a wagon, too.
			(beat)
		Something Japanese... God, what was
		it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You
		thought it had no character.

				CARSON
		I thought that about all of them.
		C'mon, think, dammit!!

				MIRANDA
		You think!! You were there, too!

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

				CARSON
		Call the outdoor advertising
		companies. Get the location of all
		the billboards for Japanese cars
		within our search parameters.

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

				DAVE
			(into phone)
		...Peerless Auto Security. We need
		to know whether you've sold a large

INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - GENERAL KAI'S OFFICE - DAY

General Kai stands in hushed conversation with the Army Major
Operative and another trusted AIDE. The PHONE buzzes; the
others leave the room before General Kai picks it up.



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - OPERATIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

Behind closed doors, the Operative LISTENS to the phone call
with an EAVESDROPPING RECEIVER. What he hears stuns him.

							CUT TO:

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY

The Operative is in his hiding spot with his uplink device.

				OPERATIVE
			(urgently; into device)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped! It was switched by
		order of --

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"
button on the uplink device before dying.

On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then
another GUNSHOT destroys it.

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative
over with his foot.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is
trying not to squirm. Mrs. Han looks at him, angry.

				MRS. HAN
		He asked you if you had to go...

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...

EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

				JOY
		Oh, my God...

The meters are hovering just below the red...



SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,
still on Air Force One, APPEARS on the VIDEO LINK. Cut the
tension in the room with a knife? You'd need a chainsaw.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
		using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.



				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
			(continuing)
		Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
		they attacked a Genoese fort, and
		catapulted infected corpses over the
		walls. The Genoese who survived
		carried the disease back to Europe...
		and it killed half the population.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		Get to the goddamn point, Major.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

				CIA CHIEF
		Seems the missile is armed with a
		warhead carrying the Pneumonic
		Plague.

The President goes nuts.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
		to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
		What happened to this "limited
		retaliation" shit?

				SECRETARY OF STATE
		The North Koreans insist the missile
		carries a conventional payload. They
		say we're trying to trick them into
		aborting the attack.

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		Especially since the uplink from our
		Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.

				CIA CHIEF
		We think one of the Hard-liners
		switched the warhead without the
		Premier's knowledge. But he's not
		about to take our word for it, and
		he's too weak to risk the
		humiliation of backing down.

				PRESIDENT
			(incredulous; thru video
			link)
		They use a biological weapon on
		American soil, they have to know
		we'll respond!



				SECRETARY OF STATE
		Maybe they don't think we got the
		guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
		they think they can whip us, like
		what happened in 'Nam. Look who
		we're dealing with: a teetering,
		outlaw regime, and inside it, some
		wild-ass renegades working their
		screwy agenda!

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
		We've deployed Marines from Pendleton
		and Twenty-Nine Palms, Army from Ft.
		Irwin, put 'em in protective suits,
		but it's 40 minutes before they're on
		the ground.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		All right. Assuming the worst...
		What'll happen?

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The warhead vents the plague
		bacteria above the target area,
		infecting about 50,000 people. First
		symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes
		become swollen; temperature rises to
		105. Victims turn deep purple from
		lung hemorrhaging, usually die the
		same day.
			(beat)
		There are treatments -- streptomycin
		and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
		overwhelmed by the numbers and its
		extreme contagiousness.

				CIA CHIEF
		We could have 500,000 infected in a
		week, who knows how many after that.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have
		the Summit leaders been warned?



				FBI CHIEF
		Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
		'til we give the all-clear.

				PRESIDENT
			(thru video link)
		And you're sure it's safe if we can
		get 'em to destroy the missile in
		flight?

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		The bacteria can't survive the heat
		of an explosion.

				CIA CHIEF
		I suggest none of this go any
		further -- not even to the agents
		working to find the family. Word
		leaks out to a city of 12 million
		people there's rocket full of the
		Plague coming at 'em, you'll create
		a panic of biblical proportions.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Everyone is painfully on edge. Ambassador Han paces. The FBI

Colonel Lee mutters something to Ambassador Han in Korean.

		Perhaps someone will decide it is
		foolish to incur the wrath of North
		Korea.

				CARSON

		Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole

				CARSON
		Let's grab a few beers, kick back

		Why wait until five?

Ambassador Han and Walther keep Carson and Colonel Lee from
going at each other.

				MIRANDA
		Pete!

		Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep

		corridor, Museum Row, Mid-
		Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip
		there's a few...

				CARSON
		Sabatini! What about that billboard?

				SABATINI
		Nothing yet! Everyone's left their
		goddamn offices already!

				CARSON
			(to Robbins)
		LAPD will have a record of all
		emergency vehicles running Code 3 at
		9:32 AM. Get their starting point
		and their destination.

				MIRANDA
		And have them narrow their foot-
		searches to areas around high-rises.



				CARSON
			(to Dave)
		Where's that fuckin' address?!

				DAVE
		I'm still holdin'!

Meanwhile, we hear the high-pitched whine as Dave's MODEM
connects with another computer. Dave's fingers fly across the
keyboard, and in a moment, a PICTURE of Javal appears: hair
longer, bearded... but the eyes are unmistakable.

				DAVE
			(continuing)
		He's on our hit parade. Interpol
		passed us his records when he
		entered the country.
			(reads)
		French by birth... looks like a total
		scumbag.

				SABATINI
		Isn't that redundant?

				DAVE
			(reads from computer)
		Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe;
		served some short stretches, petty
		shit... arrested for kidnapping, no
		conviction. Did four years in France
		for blowing bank vaults. Moved to
		U.S. last year. Clean since then.

				CARSON
		Get his Driver's License number;
		Social; bank accounts; charge cards;
		club memberships... find out what
		movies he rented.  Get whoever's
		closest to the Auto Shop to get in
		there, interview everybody.

				MIRANDA
		This sure was a ballsy move for a
		car-alarm installer.

				CARSON
		Hey, he watched the news... Everyone
		knows the U.S. will do anything to
		avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.

They turn, noticing that Ambassador Han has overheard.

				MIRANDA
		Ambassador --



				CARSON
		-- Quit apologizing for me!

				MIRANDA
		Quit giving me reasons to!

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(to Carson)
		On occasion, my wife has been known
		to kick my ankle under the table.

Miranda gives Carson a "your turn to be gracious" look.

				CARSON
		Sounds like her aim's a little low.

Not exactly what Miranda was hoping for. Dave hands Carson a
piece of paper.

				DAVE
		Address, according to the Auto Shop.

				CARSON
			(looks at paper)
		Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise!
		Sabatini -- you're with us.
			(off Robbins' disappointed
			look)
		She's got the field experience.

Carson and Miranda grab their jackets, then she stops.

				MIRANDA
		There still could be accomplices.
		If there are, they'll hear us in
		the helicopter.

Carson looks again at the address...

				CARSON
		There's a TV station a couple blocks
		away. We'll land on their pad.
			(to Robbins)
		K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a
		SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to
		hang back unless we need 'em.

EXT.  OSAKA, JAPAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

SUPER: Osaka. Western Japan.

INT.  OSAKA APARTMENT - DAY

In the tiny bedroom of a wheelchair-bound JAPANESE TEENAGER,
computers and HAM RADIO equipment are stacked everywhere.

He turns on a tape recorder. We hear a faint, crackling VOICE:



				OPERATIVE'S VOICE (VO)
			(on recorder)
		...Missile heading to L.A. has a
		Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is
		Kipchak equipped!

The Teenager rolls to a computer running CompuServe. He clicks
the CHAT icon, types: "Anyone up on their spy terminology?"

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - LOS ANGELES - DAY

With the gardeners gone, and their sound sensors disabled,
Mrs. Han, Joy and Sam are SHOUTING for help.

They listen for a response; it is completely quiet.

EXT.  K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter
lands right next to it.

Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on
the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,
videotaping everything.

				CARSON
		Oh, great, the media...
			(realizing)
		It's the goddamn traffic girl!

				MIRANDA
		Traffic person.

				BOBBI
		Where are you going?

				CARSON
		We can't get into that right now...

				BOBBI
		Hey, you expect to use my station's
		facilities and not even tell us --

Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and
crushes the tape.

				MIRANDA
			(to Bobbi)
		Sorry...



				BOBBI
			(looks Miranda over)
		What the fuck are you, the Barbie
		Corporate Ass-Lick model?

Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket
and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi
by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.

				MIRANDA
		Guess what, Sister... you're about
		to spend the next five years in a
		penitentiary for interfering with a
		federal investigation.

The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.

				STATION MANAGER
		Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their
		news blackout!

				BOBBI
			(to herself)
		Figures... you dickless wonder.

Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his
wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.

The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.

				STATION MANAGER
		I get an exclusive later, right?

				CARSON
		This works out, I'll play the
		fuckin' banjo for you.

EXT.  SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

The cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food,
wine and beer... and crank up the Beach Boys TUNES.

Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high
rises -- Century City, Westwood, downtown, etc.

EXT.  U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa.

Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight
line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts.

They begin to TAKE OFF...



EXT.  FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY

The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.

Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped
vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners --
until he finds the reason for the jam-up:

Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.

He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.

				CARSON
		We're hoofing it.

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

				SABATINI
			(pissed)
		'She's got the field experience'...
		To park the fuckin' car!

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

				CARSON
			(pulls out his i.d.)
		Whoa... FBI..!

They lower their weapons.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		How the hell you get here so fast?



				SWAT TEAM #1
		They're shootin' a cop movie down
		the street. We're workin' as extras.

				CARSON
		Terrific. Who else is here?

				SWAT TEAM #1
		Three officers on the roof, next
		building over, and two in the tenth-
		floor hallway.

				CARSON
		Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
			(to Concierge)
		Give me your master key.

EXT.  ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.

				SWAT TEAM #1
			(thru radio)
		Feds going up -- Anglo male and
		female; Asian male.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

				WOMAN
		What the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

				CARSON
			(to Miranda)
		Wait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
		while I look around.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

				MIRANDA
		I like what you've done with the
		place...



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

				COLONEL LEE
		Wait!

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

				SABATINI
		Where's Carson?

				COLONEL LEE
		Inside.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

				CARSON
		NO! --

Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY

SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

				CARSON
		I said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

				MIRANDA
		Stop it!

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

				CARSON
			(to Colonel Lee)
		Get out of my sight.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

It's in between reports. The Cameraman listens to the Grateful
Dead on a BOOM BOX. Bobbi answers her ringing CELL PHONE.

				BOBBI
			(into phone)
		Marchfelder.

				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(thru phone)
		You dated the Mayor, right?

				BOBBI
			(sighs; into phone)
		You need a traffic ticket fixed?



				STATION MANAGER (VO)
			(excited; thru phone)
		Try to confirm something for us.
		There's an incredible buzz on the
		Internet -- someone picked up a
		classified message on a U.S.
		Intelligence frequency. We think
		it's authentic!

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,
as the festivities really start rockin'.

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		What's the status?

				ROBBINS (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Wilshire and West PD Divisions had
		seven vehicles running with sirens at
		9:32. They're getting the routes from
		the officers now.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Hurry it the hell up.

He glances over at Miranda. After a beat:

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		I should've known she'd come up.

				MIRANDA
		Pete --

				CARSON
		-- "Should've." Shit, there's a
		familiar word.
			(long beat)
		That day... I was there soon enough.
		We should've rushed 'em, before they
		could finish setting up...



				MIRANDA
		The Bureau never would've let you.
		They want it by the book: talk them
		out.

Carson looks out the window, not hearing a word she says...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT./EXT.  BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

				CARSON
		Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.

				MIRANDA
		You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your
		decision. You can't keep living as
		such a raw nerve, never sleeping --

				CARSON
		-- Those kids were ten years old!
			(sotto)
		Same age as the Han boy...

He turns away. She takes his hand.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family continues to call for HELP. As they do, we

							CUT TO:



INT.  HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APARTMENT - DAY

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,
construction equipment, sheets of drywall, etc.

A warning sign taped to the wall near the elevator reads:
     
		This Floor Has Been Temporarily Vacated
		For Minor Earthquake Retrofitting.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

				CARSON
		C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
		records? What about cross-referencing
		possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

				MIRANDA
		Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
			(reaches for phone)
		Where are the numbers for the
		outdoor ad companies?

				ROBBINS
		Parker Center's making those calls.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Bobbi and the News Cameraman are arguing bitterly:

				BOBBI
		Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!

				CAMERAMAN
		Maybe it's true... probably is true.
		That's why they got a news blackout!

				BOBBI
		I'll rip your miserable eyeballs
		out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!

He sighs and turns the CAMERA on.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE ANGLE ON TV - DAY

The Han family listens to Bobbi, amazed, horrified...



				BOBBI
			(on TV)
		...A warning was radioed to U.S.
		Intelligence that a biological weapon,
		allegedly containing the deadly
		Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los
		Angeles. While unconfirmed, the
		President and other leaders are all
		late in arriving...

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.

				DAVE
		Finally got the call list from
		Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
		they're from the legit user who
		didn't know his number was cloned.

				CARSON
		Go to the bottom of the list, work
		back through the last 12 hours.

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

				DAVE
		Here's the call to the Consulate --
		965-5000.
			(while scrolling)
		The rest are dupes... all from the
		other guy...

				CARSON
		Wait... go back... the one at seven
		this morning...

Dave highlights a number: 213-965-5666.

WIDER

Carson glances over at the telephone on Colonel Lee's desk.

(FLASHBACK) - CLOSE ON PHONE

from when Carson took a call there, pushing the mute button.

(FLASHBACK) - EXTREME CLOSE UP

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."



BACK TO SCENE

Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

				CARSON
		Get down!

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		MIRANDA!

Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

				MIRANDA
		Go..!

EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and
severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a
drive in the country.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and
Ambassador Han gets in.

				CARSON
		Get the fuck out of here!

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson
sighs and tears out of the driveway.

EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then
hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,
zooming past the snarl of cars.

EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs
into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson looks around at the chaos around them.

				CARSON
		Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out
		here!

Then he HEARS, on a nearby car's FM RADIO:



				FM NEWSCASTER (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...These words, which have terrified
		the city:

				RECORDING OF BOBBI (VO)
			(thru car radio)
		...A biological weapon, allegedly
		containing the deadly Pneumonic

Stunned, Carson looks over at Ambassador Han, who buries his
face in his hands.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Miranda..!

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I heard. I'm in the copter.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		I want you to get out of here...

INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Miranda is flying just behind Carson's Volvo. The TRAFFIC is
beyond nightmarish. She smiles at his concern for her.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Shut up and keep your eyes on the
		road. That's my goddamn car.
			(beat; into radio)
		Dave? You staying on top of the
		research?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Sweating, Dave is watching the ACTION outside on a TV while
hurriedly bandaging Robbins' shoulder with some torn cloth. He
grabs for the two-way and we realize he's panicking.

				DAVE
			(into radio)
		I can't... My kids...

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio; calmly)
		Listen: the best way to help them is
		to stay at your computer. If any
		information comes in, holler. Okay?

He squeezes his eyes shut... After a long beat:



				DAVE
			(into radio)
		Okay...

EXT.  SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Several large military helicopters approach -- troop
contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.

The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES
and ARMY INFANTRY.

Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to
follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the
helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.

We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,
Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of
pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the
heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --
in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he
HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) DAY

Bobbi is salivating with excitement (and antacid.) She snaps
off her mic and yells at her Cameraman:

				BOBBI
		Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull
		back... show the other copters around
		us... this is fuckin' great...

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Ambassador Han looks glumly at the chaos in the streets.



				CARSON
		...The Colonel hired Javal, made it
		look like he was working alone. Then
		he made sure Javal got killed, so
		we'd never find your family -- and
		they'd have an excuse to drop their
		bomb. But what's in it for 'em?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There are men in my government whose
		power depends on North Korea staying
		as it is: Socialist, repressive,
		isolated from the world. They'll
		resort to anything, even war, to
		keep it that way. They have the
		Hitler Syndrome: if their country
		cannot exist the way they want it,
		they would rather see it destroyed.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto
the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.

Marine MAJOR VREELAND and his PILOT sit in the lead
helicopter, an Apache Gunship.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson leans on the HORN and tries to push through traffic.

				VREELAND (VO)
			(thru radio)
		FBI, this is Major Vreeland.
		Discontinue your pursuit, we're

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Negative -- his car's armored! And we
		need the bastard alive!!

				VREELAND (VO)
			(thru radio)
		We've got the situation in hand.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee sees the Apache helicopter approach. He leans into
the back seat, knocking the top off a long, plastic crate.



INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The SUNROOF on the Mercedes slides open. Colonel Lee's upper
body pokes through the sunroof. He's holding a manportable
S.A.M. -- a 3-foot-long, fiberglass rocket launcher.

Vreeland tries to bring his machine guns to bear on Colonel
Lee, but there's no time...

				VREELAND
			(to Pilot)
		Shit! Pull back!

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a
rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the
Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two
tons of red-hot shrapnel.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - DAY

Carson and Ambassador Han watch with horror.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

A hundred yards away, they're BUFFETED by the explosion.

				BOBBI
			(to TV camera)
		Jesus fuckin' God!!!
			(beat; smiles)
		Uh, I think we're gonna set down
		now. Back to you, Brent.

EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-
mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.

Hot metal and debris PINGS and POPS as it rains over the
neighborhood, sending cars and pedestrians rushing for cover.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - DAY

Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.

				VREELAND
			(into radio)
		Out of the air, or retreat 7,000
		meters from target vehicle!

The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.
Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming
them in an attempt to leave the city.

The Han family watches the TV, amazed, as Colonel Lee ducks
back down into the Mercedes and closes the sunroof.

				JOY
		I always hated that guy...

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the
biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee
squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Pieces of burning DEBRIS are still landing nearby. Carson
looks at Ambassador Han:

				CARSON
		One of yours?
			(Han nods)
		What the hell do you need heat-
		seeking rockets for in L.A.?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		There could be another riot...

				CARSON
			(shakes his head)
		And they call me Mr. Overkill.
			(into radio)
		Dave, what do you know about...

He looks at Han.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Strela-2...

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave, calmer but still sweating, taps at his computer. A
schematic of Colonel Lee's rocket launcher appears on it.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda has hitched a ride in a black-and-white.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Stay back. LAPD's putting up a
		roadblock.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP
BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.

They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then
stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their
huge front shovels to create a roadblock.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - CLOSE - DAY

Bobbi sits impatiently, microphone in hand...

WIDER

The copter has landed behind an AM-PM Minimart/gas station.

Bobbi, her Pilot and her Cameraman turn when they hear a
KNOCKING on the windshield of their copter...

Oblivious to the panic on the streets, a raggedy HOMELESS GUY
stands with a spray bottle, wanting to wash the windows on the
copter. Bobbi gulps some Mylanta and waves him away:

				BOBBI
		Save it for someone who gives a
		shit!



EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.
So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.

MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and
hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking
lots.

PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and
windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.

INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers,
angling the Mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.

The other drivers really give him wide berth now...

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.

INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Traffic moves aside for Colonel Lee's notorious Mercedes.
Carson catches up to it.

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to
		arm, so stay tight on his ass.

Carson SLAMS his Volvo into the Mercedes. Ambassador Han
braces himself on the dashboard. Carson looks over at him.



				CARSON
		That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses
		you'd like to tell me about?

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		I don't think so -- they said it was
		solid as a rock.

				CARSON
			(looks at his crumpled car)
		No shit...

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo
CRASHES headfirst into the back of the truck.

The Volvo's AIRBAGS deploy, stopping Carson and Ambassador Han
from plowing into the dashboard. After a beat:

				AMBASSADOR HAN
			(dazed)
		I can't believe I'm still alive...

				CARSON
		This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

				CARSON
		Get me out of here...

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

				CARSON
			(continuing; into radio)
		Anybody see him?

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Still heading north on the 110.

The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador
Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

				CARSON

		Dave... You're sure those rockets
		are heat-seeking?

				DAVE (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Classic IR, reflective optical

Carson climbs into the back of the ambulance.

INT.  AMBULANCE - DAY

Carson rummages through the supplies, finds what he's looking
for, and (BELOW FRAME) starts stuffing them into a canvas bag.

EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY

Carson climbs onto the roof of the ambulance.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		This is Carson. I need a copter.

EXT.  HELICOPTERS - (VARIOUS ANGLES) - DAY

Everyone in the grounded helicopters -- LAPD, National Guard,
Marines, media -- react to Carson's request as if he's crazy.

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Something small and nimble.
		Anybody... come in low, from the
		south... I'm on an ambulance by the
		9th Street exit.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio)
		Are you out of your mind?

INT.  NEWS COPTER - DAY

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the
minimart, listening to this exchange on a POLICE SCANNER. Her
Cameraman is eating a microwave burrito. Bobbi jumps in, grabs
the ENG camera, and yells at her Pilot:



				BOBBI
		Get this fuckin' thing in the air!
			(to Cameraman)
		Out! Not enough room for four.

				CAMERAMAN
			(as they TAKE OFF)
		What am I supposed to do when the
		plague comes, hold my breath?

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

They rapidly cut through the traffic.

		Switch to a secure channel.

		What on earth are you thinking?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		I'll make him open the sunroof.

				MIRANDA
			(into radio)
		Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or
		anything on me, have you?

				CARSON (VO)
			(thru radio)
		No way. I couldn't stand making so
		many people happy.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson closes the door, then sees Bobbi.

				CARSON
		You?! I wanted a police copter!

				PILOT
		Just tell me what to do. I flew two
		tours in 'Nam.



				BOBBI
		And he doesn't go unless I go!

				CARSON
		Wrong-o...

							CUT TO:

EXT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!

WIDER

They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.
Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

BOBBI

surfaces, sputtering and screaming:

				BOBBI
		I'm a respected electronic
		journalist, you fuckin' prick!!

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of
Mylanta out after her.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

In the distance, there is smog on the horizon.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They follow the 110 north. Ahead, Carson sees the Mercedes
cutting across lanes.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Got 'im -- looks like he's headed
		for the 101.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.



				CARSON
			(to Pilot)
		Pull hard to the left, on my
		signal...

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

				CARSON
		Now!

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

INT.  POLICE CRUISER - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Miranda sees what Carson is doing.

				MIRANDA
		You fucking lunatic!!

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The News Pilot looks over at Carson.

				PILOT
		Hope you got more flares than he's
		got rockets.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...



EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

VARIOUS ANGLES

As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.



				MIRANDA
		Sorry...

INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

				MIRANDA
		You're completely deranged! Playing
		chicken with rockets!

				CARSON
		Well, what the hell were you doing
		out there?

				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
		What are both of you doing?

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

				CARSON
		Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.

				MIRANDA
		Even if we can pry him out with...
			(looks at her watch)
		Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
		be very cooperative.

				CARSON
		I'll just use my outstanding people
		skills.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Ambassador
			Han)
		That car's like a rock, right?

EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY

Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.



INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY

Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY

Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY

WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

CLOSER

Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.



				MIRANDA
		Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
		Well, these are fuck you pumps!
			(pushes harder)
		Where's the family?

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Dave sits in front of his computer, phone receiver resting on
his shoulder, riveted by the ACTION on the TV.

				DAVE
		Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned

He turns as his MODEM squawks and another download comes in.

				DAVE
			(continuing; into phone)
		You're sure there were no accounts in
		the other names I gave you?

EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

				AMBASSADOR HAN
		Let him up.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

				COLONEL LEE
		Victory!

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

WIDER

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.



EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

No answer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

Police cars, military vehicles, fire trucks, etc. converge on
the complex from all directions.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

				VOICE THRU PA
		Han family. Show us your location...

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

				JOY
		Mother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

				MRS. HAN
		Do it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

INT.  PARK LA BREA OFFICE - DAY

Several COPS and MARINES burst into the office. Milton, the
Assistant Manager, cowers as they SHOOT the lock off the door
to the inner office and rush in.

				MILTON
		It's a brown binder... Says "Rental
		Manifest." You can't miss it...

They literally tear the office apart.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FIRE is consuming the curtains. Thick, toxic SMOKE begins
to fill the tiny apartment, and everyone starts coughing.

INT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

They circle, overwhelmed by the sheer number of apartments.

				CARSON
			(into radio)
		Apartment number would be real

Miranda points to a wisp of SMOKE above one of the towers.

		There!

They come around, and spot the FIRE in the apartment's window.
It is nine stories up, four stories below the top floor.

EXT.  SKY ABOVE OCEAN - FOLLOW CRUISE MISSILE - DAY

The coast looms closer.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY

The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

				CARSON
		Okay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

				LISA
		Hurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

				CARSON
		DON'T!

He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		We have to go out the window.

				MRS. HAN
		Can't you disarm the bomb?



				CARSON
		Too risky. Let's concentrate on
		getting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		Sound detectors?

				MRS. HAN
		Sam covered them with chewing gum.

				SAM
		High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

				CARSON
		Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
		convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
		seat, he sets the alarm off. These
		are rigged backwards -- get up, you
		set 'em off.

				SAM
		You a bomb expert?

				CARSON
		Nope. But I've had some car alarms
		in my day.
			(to himself)
		For all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

				CARSON
			(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
		Slide your arm forward... Watch the
		meter... Keep the pressure on the
		armrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

				CARSON
			(continuing)
		It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
		the weight of your arm... Okay...
		pick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



				CARSON
			(continuing; to Sam)
		Low-tech solution...
			(to Mrs. Han)
		Lean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

				MIRANDA (VO)
			(thru radio in his pocket)
		How's it going in there?

				CARSON
			(to himself)
		Nag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making
an incredible racket.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

WIDER

The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.

				CARSON
		You'll be over in five seconds...

She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.

ANGLE ON BOMB

One minute... fifty-nine seconds...

CARSON

sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs.
Han into it...

				CARSON
		Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.

ANGLE ON BOMB

Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...

THE HARNESS

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Fifteen seconds to go...

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

				CARSON

		Release the cable from your side!
		Get out of here!

		Come over the railing! Grab onto the

				MIRANDA
		Tear the hook loose!



				PILOT
		It'll pop the winch buckle!

				MIRANDA
		Try it anyway!

INT./EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER -
DAY

Five seconds to go...

The Apache helicopter backs away from the high-rise...

The cable pulls taut...

Carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist...

The Apache STRAINS against the resistance of the cable...

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...

The helicopter turns and flies away...

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.

All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

CARSON

is engulfed in the FIREBALL... We can't tell if he's alive.

INT./EXT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.

BELOW

Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.

Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.

Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.

Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

WIDER

Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air;
helicopters crisscross the scene.

Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile...



INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - (INCLUDE TV) -
DAY

The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at
Park LaBrea on CNN Live...

...As Ambassador Han embraces his family.

Furious, General Kai gets up and leaves the conference room.

The others look at the Premier. After a beat, he crosses to a
PANEL OF ELECTRONICS and SLAPS a large red button on it...

EXT.  SKY ABOVE SANTA MONICA - DAY

The cruise missile EXPLODES, completely obliterating it.

EXT.  U.S. FIGHTER BOMBERS - SKY OVER SEA OF JAPAN - DAY

The lead jet cuts away, turning around. The others follow.

EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY

The Han family crosses to Carson, blackened and bloody,
sitting on the curb next to Miranda. Ambassador Han shakes
his hand. Mrs. Han and Miranda cry. Joy and Sam grin at him.
After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms. It is a
profound catharsis for him...

EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - DAY

General Kai is getting into his car. He look up as an ARMY
OFFICER approaches... and SHOOTS him! The Officer pushes his
body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off.

							FADE THRU TO:

DARKNESS

and the sound of RUNNING WATER.

EXT.  PASTORAL SCENE - DAY

A beautiful ranch house and horse barn, sitting on a meadow
beside a brook, overlooking an unspoiled pine forest.

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV.

Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces.

				CARSON
			(into phone)
		...I'll call you next week.

Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room.
The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)...

EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO - NIGHT

Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is WATERING her sickly roses.
Carson comes outside.

				MIRANDA
		Who was that on the phone?

				CARSON
		The Bureau.
			(beat)
		They want me back on the hostage
		team.

				MIRANDA
		What did you say?

				CARSON
		Told 'em I'd sleep on it...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

				MIRANDA
		Working with you today was
		certainly... interesting, Inspector.

				CARSON
		It's my outstanding people skills.

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

				MIRANDA
		I hate this fucking town...

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...

							FADE OUT.
Rush Hour 2

 


















					RUSH HOUR 2

					BY

					Jeff Nathanson

































	EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

	A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
	watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
	a half million people a day.

	EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

	THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

	HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
	VENDOR across the street.

	She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:

	THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

	TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
	a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
	street vendor.

				HU LI
			(Chinese, subtitled)
		Someone better call the police.

	EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
	a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
	dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
	look to two girls in a convertible.

				CARTER
			(int Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

	The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
	is driving and singing to his radio.

				LEE
			(singing)
		...wish they all could be California...
		wish they all could be California
		girls...

	Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
	out of the SUNROOF.

				CARTER
		I warned you about playing that shit
		when I'm in the car.

				LEE
		That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
		Chinese man's CD.

				CARTER
		Did you see the way those girls drove
		off?  I did you a favor.

				LEE
		Those girls drove off because of you.

				CARTER
		All I did was invite them for a drink.

				LEE
		You invited them to get naked and
		sacrifice a small goat.

				CARTER
			(checking Chinese-English
			 dictionary)
		I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

	Lee picks up his CD case.

				LEE
		You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
		Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

				CARTER
		Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
		been here three days and we haven't done
		shit.  We haven't been to a club,
		haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on
		vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

				LEE
		Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

				CARTER
		Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some
		women.  Now stop playing dumb and show
		me the shu!

	Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over
	LEE'S CELL PHONE.

	INTERCUT

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, there was a bombing at the American
		Embassy.  Two American translators were
		killed.

				LEE
		Any leads?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(beat)
		We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
		want to take the case, I'll understand.

				LEE
		It's my responsibility.

	Lee hangs up the cell phone.

				CARTER
		What was that?  Did you just pick up a
		case?  Did we just take another damn
		case on my vacation?

	Lee smiles at Carter.

				LEE
		Of course not.  My Superindendent
		invited us to a club tonight.  Big
		party.

				CARTER
		Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will
		kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard
		you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

				LEE
		Carter, would I lie to you?
						
			EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
	way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
	hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
	when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

				CARTER
		That's what I'm talking about.  A real
		Hong Kong night club.  You want an
		Altoid?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		You better take one.  Your breath has
		been a little funky all day.  Let me
		look at you.

	Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just relax and don't worry about a
		thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You
		got condoms?

				LEE
		No.  

				CARTER
		Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
		it in half.

	Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
	GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
	to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
	a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
	Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

				LEE
		I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		They don't like tourists in here, so try
		to blend in.

				CARTER
		Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than
		everyone here.  Where you going?

				LEE
		Bathroom.

	Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

				CARTER
		How you boys doing tonight?

	The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	OLD MAN continues to sing.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That is the worst singing I've ever
		heard.  That sounds like something you'd
		hear in prison after lights out.

	The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
	door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
	MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

				CARTER (V.O.)
		Get closer to my body now.  And just
		love me, till you don't know how...

	Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
	realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
	YOU GET ENOUGH."

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
	watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
	Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
	few of the smitten women who are watching him.

				LEE
			(whispering from side of stage)
		Carter, get off that stage!

				CARTER
		Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
		star, Lee.  A god to these people!

	Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
	the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

				LEE
		This is a gangster bar, we're here
		undercover.

				CARTER
		I knew you were lying.

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		Damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
		I'm just starting to have fun.
			(beat)
		Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
		badge and do your thing.

				LEE
		No, we're here for information, to find
		out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
		must tread softly and keep our ears
		open.

				CARTER
		Tread softly?  Who taught you how to
		roost a bar?

				LEE
		Carter, you don't understand.  These men
		are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
		most deadly gang in China.

				CARTER
		Man, are you crazy?  You think that
		scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
		gangs.  We were having gang wars before
		anybody even thought about it.  We get
		royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
		your badge and gun and I'll show you how
		it's done.

				LEE
		No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
		Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

				CARTER
		You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
		last night.

	Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
	Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
		lui.

	Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
	Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(whispering)
		What'd I say?

				LEE
		You just said you're their worst
		nightmare - and to line their mothers up
		for a milking.

				CARTER
		Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
		out.

	Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
	as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let's try this again.  Who here knows
		Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Now I know you're lying.  

	The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
	spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(as they run out)
		I come back and catch y'all singing
		Michael Jackson and you're all going to
		jail.

	EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
	and several gangsters round a corner.

				CARTER
		Stop!  LAPD!

	Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
	GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
	under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
	Their only way out is UP.

	Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
	them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
	VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

				CARTER
		Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

	Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
	CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
	LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
	pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

	BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
	to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

	WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
	CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Forget this...

	He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
	come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
	after the GANGSTER LEADER.

	ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

	Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
	the hill.

	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

	Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
	WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
	OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

	HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

	As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
	OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

				CARTER
			(out of breath)
		Freeze!  Nobody move!

	Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
	Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

	She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
	ROOF!

	He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
	the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

	LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

	They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
	Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
	She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

	CARTER AND LEE

	holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
	to bend.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

				LEE
		Try to land on your feet.

	Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

				CARTER
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit.

	The POLE BREAKS
			
	SUPER THE TITLE:

	RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

	INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

	Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in
	silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

				CARTER
		You lied to me. 

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		You're sorry.  I got somebody's old
		chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
		tell me you're sorry.  Just take me
		home.

				LEE
		No time.  There was an explosion at the
		American Embassy today -- two American
		translators were killed.

	Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

				CARTER
		So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
		up the Embassy?

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

	Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
	year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

	MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

				CARTER
		I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
		this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -
		let one of them be your partner.

				LEE
		This won't take long. 

	Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

				MASTER FU
		Dragon kick!

	Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Lotus block!

	The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu
	notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Twisting Tiger!

	No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
			(staring straight at Lee)
		Twisting Tiger!

	Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
	that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in
	the glow...

	...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Didn't I teach you to always arch your
		back?

				LEE
			(bowing, humbled)
		Yes, Master.

	While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
	YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

				CARTER
		I was watching you kids.  My name is
		Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
		black belt.  At least that's what I tell
		the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
		where I work out.

	Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
	reaction.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me give you kids some tips.  The key
		to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why
		don't you stand up.

	THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw
	punches.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show
		you how to block.  Come on, stand up,
		give me your best shot -- try to kick
		right to my head.

	The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
	HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
	to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of
	the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That's pretty good.  Which one of you
		kids did that?

	INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Master Fu walking.

				LEE
		I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a
		man who used to train with you.  He's
		become a killer - the worst kind of
		animal.

				MASTER FU
		Animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
		The man you seek is lower than a
		serpent.  
			(faces Lee)
		...he kills for money.

	In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
	disappear O.S.

	Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
	thought.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		He was the best I ever trained, you
		know.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan?

				MASTER FU
		No.  Your father.
			(Lee reacts)
		Your father and Ricky Tan were my
		favorite students... and for such awful
		things to happen as they did --

	Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
	uncomfortable.

				LEE
		How do I find Ricky Tan?

	AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by
	in the other direction, disappear O.S.

	Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

				MASTER FU
		A seeding spends its entire life
		reaching towards Heaven.

				LEE
		I know, Master, but...

				MASTER FU
		The answers you seek can be found in
		Heaven on Earth.

				LEE
		Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't
		understand.
			(working it)
		A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A
		mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

				MASTER FU
		It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven
		on Earth."  You will find your answers
		there.

	Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
	pathway.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

	Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
	Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Cheap bastard...

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
	students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
	locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
	hands, and sitting on the last one.

				CARTER
		And that's how you use the LAPD choke
		hold.  Now start practicing and don't
		make me come back here!

				LEE
		Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

				LEE
		Just follow my lead and act like a
		tourist.

				CARTER
		I am a tourist.

	INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand
	in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 

				HOSTESS
		Good afternoon, gentlemen.

	Lee bows, followed by Carter.

				LEE
			(in Chinese)
		Hello.

				CARTER
		How you doin'?

				LEE
		My friend is on vacation, from America. 
		I want to show him a good time.

				HOSTESS
		Oh, you American?

				CARTER
		That's right.

				HOSTESS
		You bring American money?

				CARTER
			(holding up a Platinum AmEx)
		Never leave home without it.
			(to Lee)
		Lee, this one's on me.  You save your
		money.

	The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN
	SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL
	WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

				HOSTESS
		You get massage from Chinese girl
		before?

				CARTER
		No.  It's my first time.

				HOSTESS
		You pick any girl for you and your
		friend.

	Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

				CARTER
		Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that
		one.

				HOSTESS
		Oh yes, she's very nice.

				CARTER
		She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm
		gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take
		that one, too.  How you doin', baby? 
		And...that one in pink.  She can do my
		feet.

	Lee elbows Carter.

				LEE
		What are you doing?

				CARTER
		She said I could pick any girl I want.

				LEE
		Well, hurry up.

				CARTER
		Hey!  You don't break in front of a
		black man in a buffet line.

				HOSTESS
			(to Lee)
		Your friend have big appetite.
			(handing ROBES to Lee and
			 Carter)
		Please put these on and wait upstairs in
		the quiet room.

	INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women
	massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's
	showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
	background. 

	Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
	PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
	TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

				CARTER
		Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come
		through, Lee.

	LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
	SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of
	sophistication and brutality.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				LEE
		Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

				CARTER
		That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. 
		I'll go over with you right now, shake
		him down.

				LEE
		This is a very dangerous man.

				CARTER
		I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna
		ruin my massage because of some midget
		in a house coat.

				LEE
		I'm calling for back up!

	Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

	Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
	with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a
	decision, gets up and walks towards him.

				CARTER
		Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
		for you.  Get up.

	Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

				RICKY TAN
		I'm busy at the moment.

				CARTER
		I said get on your feet!

				RICKY TAN
		I know you, Detective Carter, right? 
		You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying
		your visit?

				CARTER
		I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
		and don't let the robe fool you.  This
		is the only color they had left.  Now
		get up!

	Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
	from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
	against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
	around the room waiting to move.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I told you to get on your feet!

	Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
	breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

				RICKY TAN
		Lee, I've missed you, brother.
			(getting up, giving Lee a hug)
		I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
		sorry, you must be under great pressure.

				LEE
		You must come with me for questioning.

				CARTER
		Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken
		and hot oil waiting for me.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think so...

	A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
	towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
	Lee and Carter.  A beat...

				CARTER
		I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

				RICKY TAN
		It's no problem.  But I must excuse
		myself, inspector.

				CARTER
		That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

	Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

				RICKY TAN
		Congratulations.  And good day.

	As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
	But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

	Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
	covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

				CARTER
			(ref: his privates)
		Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

	Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
	Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
	throwing him out the front door.

	Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
	their shoulders.

	EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

	Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies
	open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway. 
	Both men are completely naked.

	EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

	A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
	people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
	behind.

				CARTER
		Goddamn you got a small ass.

				LEE
		Don't look at my ass!

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

	PANDEMONIUM

	The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET
	SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
	bullpen.

	SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
	50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Chin, you have been ordered by the
		Ministry of Public Security to assist
		the FBI and Secret Service with our
		investigation, to provide us with
		whatever we need.  If you have
		information, it belongs to us.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		This is still Hong Kong.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Two Americans have been killed on United
		States Government property -- this is
		our investigation.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
		people...

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		No.  He will report to me.  Do we
		understand each other?

	SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. 
	Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
	can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
		Who the hell is that?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(humiliated)
		That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The
		detective in charge of our
		investigation.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to
		talk to the great Inspector Lee.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting
	on a suit and fixing his tie. 
	Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
	Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

				LEE
		Where are you going?

				CARTER
		Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn
		passport back.  I'm going home.

				LEE
		Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

				CARTER
		Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,
		so I backed you up.  I was about to take
		out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

				LEE
		Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

				CARTER
		My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes
		to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
		I'm not the one who goes to massage
		parlors to bust crime lords!

				LEE
		It's my job!

				CARTER
		You're pathetic, man.  When's the last
		time you had some fun?  When's the last
		time you took a night off, had a date?

				LEE
		I have plenty of dates.

				CARTER
		Really?  When's the last time you had
		some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when
		was it?  Year of the rat?

				LEE
		You would never understand my life. 
		You're not Chinese.

				CARTER
		And you ain't black!

	The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly
	walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half
	dressed.

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin
	stands in the back.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
		the United States Secret Service.

				LEE
		The Secret Service?  Why?

				STERLING
		What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
		this room.  The men who were killed
		yesterday were not American translators. 
		They were undercover U.S. customs agents
		trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. 
		We don't know what they're transporting
		out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
		got the agents killed.

				LEE
		How can we help?

				STERLING
		Stay the hell out of our way.

				LEE
		I can get to Ricky Tan.

				STERLING
		We know all about Tan.  That's why we're
		leaving him out there as bait.  We think
		this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
		and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks
	he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

				CARTER
		Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. 
		I'm on a car phone!

	INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong
		Kong right now?

				CARTER
		Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm
		in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and
		Vine, two minutes from the station.  How
		about I pick you up right now and take
		you to dinner?

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		It's nine-thirty in the morning.

				CARTER
		Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. 
		Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Do you know what happened yesterday,
		Carter?  I was officially nominated for
		the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. 
		There was a dinner last night, two
		hundred LAPD officers were there.

				CARTER
		Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez
		there?  He owes me money.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		I've waited my whole life for this job,
		but I don't have a shot in hell of
		getting it.  Do you know why?

				CARTER
		Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You
		tell them there's no crime in being
		lonely.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is
		because the entire department is about
		to find out the stolen credit cards we
		impounded were used to buy two first
		class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what
		the hell is Heaven on Earth?

				CARTER
		Sir, I'm working on a big case over here
		-- and by the time I get back they're
		gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you
		there?  Hello?  Shit!

	As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is
	standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY
	PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
	outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
	tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
	LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

				CARTER
		How you doing?  Can you direct me to the
		Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  

	The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
	filled with birds.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my
		birds dead and deep fried.  You ever
		been to Popeyes?

	The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. 
		I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
		just put the blade down and let the bird
		go.

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own
	office - but never gets there.

	AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. 
	Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
	head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his
	destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

	STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around
	Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the
	crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back
	by the heat.

				LEE
		Carter!  CARTER!

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

	Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
	BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
	store.

				CARTER
		How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven
		on Earth.

	The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

	ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
		zi.

				MAN
		You wish to spank my sister with a ping
		pong paddle?

				CARTER
		No man, I was just asking...

				MAN
		Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

	As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

	Pause.

	Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
	if it's worth staying...

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

	Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin
	approaches.

				LEE
		All he wanted was some mu-shu.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Are you okay, Lee?

	Beat.

				LEE
		I'm sorry, I have to go.

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

	Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
	for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks
	to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
	waiting Daimler.

	The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the
	street with a determined look on his face.

				CARTER
		I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

	Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

	INT. TAXI - EVENING

	The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

				CARTER
			(loud)
		Follow that limo.

	The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You understand what I'm saying?  Follow
		that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This
		is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
			(beat)
		We are still parked -- we're not moving! 
		This is the opposite of chasing -- drive
		the car or I will kill you!

	The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes
	in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

				CAB DRIVER
		Now you speak my language.
			
	INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

	Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. 
	Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in
	tribute to Carter.

	His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

	INTERCUT -- 

	INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, we just got a call from the harbor
		patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little
		party on his boat tonight.  Victoria
		harbor.  If you don't want to...

				LEE
		Did you tell Sterling?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Let him find out on his own.  I want the
		Hong Kong police handling this.

				LEE
		Thank you.

	Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC
	up, a man on a mission.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

	A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan
	walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
	crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

	Carter steps out of the cab.

				CARTER
		Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You
		understand?

				CAB DRIVER
		Yes.  I understand.

	Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
	leaving him alone on the docks.

	Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
	parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
	names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
	politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

	CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN
	HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

				DOORMAN #1
		Invitation, please.

				CARTER
		I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

				DOORMAN #1
		The band has been playing over an hour.

				CARTER
		I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. 
		Ricky here yet, I need to get his
		requests.

	As Carter walks past the doorman -- 

				DOORMAN #1
		Wait.

				CARTER
		Last party all he wanted was Sting --
		not one person danced.  Tonight I'm
		doing Superfreak, I don't care what he
		says.  Where is he?

				DOORMAN #1
		Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the
		help.

	Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

				CARTER
		Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the
		star.  That's my band up there -- I
		control the mood, the groove, the
		atmosphere.

	Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Can you do that?
			(man shakes head "no")
		That's why you're down here and I'm up
		there.  Now this is my party -- don't
		forget it!

	Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

	The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. 
	Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
	the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
	but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
	side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
	clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
	LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

	EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

	As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
	from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
	- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
	REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
	impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
	money. 
	He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
	Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
	as sociopath.

	Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
	hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
	for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

	Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
	stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
	champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

				CARTER
		How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince
		Mubutu from Nigeria.

				ISABELLA
		Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That
		seat is taken.

				CARTER
			(in mangled Spanish)
		San Juan!  You must know my good friend
		Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
		Elizondo.

				ISABELLA
			(in English)
		I don't think so.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
		in the best circles.  But hey, I
		understand.  Make yourself at home,
		Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever
		you want.  My ship is your ship.

				ISABELLA
		This is your ship?

				CARTER
		That's right.  I'm the owner, the
		Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

				ISABELLA
		El Capitan?

				CARTER
		I don't want to play games with you,
		Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself
		with you -- in one of those bathrooms
		over there in about five minutes.

				ISABELLA
		Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a
		beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

				CARTER
		Called?  What's my ship called?
			(he has no idea)
		Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
		Johnson.

				ISABELLA
		The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name
		on the back was "Red Dragon."

				CARTER
		Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

				ISABELLA
		I'm sure, because this is my friend's
		yacht.  And it's his party.

				CARTER
		Your friend's ship?
			(looking around)
		Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the
		wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason
		my keys didn't work.

				STEVEN REIGN
			(taking seat next to Isabella)
		Who's your friend?

				ISABELLA
		Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? 
		You're big time.  You own all them big
		hotels.  What are you doing in Hong
		Kong?

				STEVEN REIGN
			(ushering away Isabella)
		I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
		in the sights.

				ISABELLA
		Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

	Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. 
	Carter's watching.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a
	BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the
	throat, pushing him against the wall.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

				BODYGUARD #1
		Who's asking?

				LEE
		The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a
		detective today and he's not getting
		away with it.  Now where is he?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or
		we'll kick your lying ass!

	Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing
	right behind him.

				LEE
		Carter?

				CARTER
		Who died?

				LEE
		You.

				CARTER
		Detective Yu?  Never met him.

				LEE
		Not Yu.  You!

				CARTER
		Who?

				LEE
		Do you understand the words that are
		coming out of my mouth?

				CARTER
		Nobody understands the words that are
		coming out of your mouth.

				BODYGUARD #1
		Get your hands in the air.

	Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front
	of them with GUNS in hand.

				BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is expecting you.
			
			INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED
	and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen
	satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door
	and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

				RICKY TAN
		Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
		You can do it, big guy.

	ON TV

	We see Shaq miss his free throw.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. 
		I just lost five grand.

	Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Why don't we go on the deck, get some
		air...and some privacy.
			(to Hu Li)
		Leave us alone.

	Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Could you have your partner wait for us
		outside?

				CARTER
		I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I
		got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

				LEE
			(to Carter)
		I'll meet you on the main deck in ten
		minutes.

	Carter pulls Lee aside.

				CARTER
		What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

				LEE
		I'm okay, you go.

				CARTER
		Why the hell should you believe him?  He
		had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty
		shit.

				LEE
		Remember I told you my father was a
		policeman?
			(beat)
		Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		What the hell is going on here?

	No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns
	and walks the other way.

	EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

	Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

				RICKY TAN
		Despite what people suspect...what you
		suspect --

				LEE
		Don't.

	Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

				RICKY TAN
		... if your father were alive, I would
		be turning to him now.
			(beat)
		I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
		but I believe some of my people did.  My
		enemies are trying to frame me.
			(beat)
		There is a war going on within the
		Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My
		name has been written into the book of
		death.

				LEE
		The police can protect you.

				RICKY TAN
		Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal
		with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get
		me out of Hong Kong.

				LEE
		Tell me why they killed the customs
		agents.

				RICKY TAN
		There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
		Harbor...

	Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

	Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
	screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
	falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

	Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
	attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
	off the bodyguards.

	INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck
	above.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
	suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

	It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
	Hu Li with his leg.

				CARTER
		All right, get your hands up.

	Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
	one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
	Bodyguard #2.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Hu Li face off.

				CARTER
		You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give
		you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

	Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

	INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches
	his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

				LEE
		Hu Li!

	Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT
	starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the
	moving boat.

	Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the
	stern.
			
	EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
	watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

	Carter turns his head, sees --

	-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
	escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
	during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears
	back into the shadows.

	EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

	The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. 
	Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

	Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was
		our only bait, and now he's gone.  You
		finally got your revenge - at the
		expense of a U.S. Government
		investigation.

				CARTER
		What "revenge" is he talking about?

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
		you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
		a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
		off this case.  I don't ever want to see
		you again, you got that?

				CARTER
		Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
		you --

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going
		back to L.A.

				CARTER
		Fine with me.

	Sterling walks away disgusted.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
		fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

	Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin
	motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
	approach.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
			(to police officers)
		Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

				LEE
		I'll take him.

				CARTER
		Hell no.

	The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to
		you.

	Carter stalks off.

				LEE
		Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood
		for your bullshit.

	Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're
	about to come to blows.

				CARTER
		What are you gonna do about it,
		grasshopper?

				LEE
		I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

				CARTER
		Give me your best shot, you flat assed
		mama's boy.

				LEE
		Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my
		ass!

				CARTER
		I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

				LEE
		No.  She's a school teacher.

				CARTER
		You're not very good at this, are you?

				LEE
		Good at what?   

				CARTER
		Forget it.

	A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

				LEE
		Five years ago, my father was Chief
		Inspector working a big international
		smuggling case.

				CARTER
		Ask me if I give a shit.

	Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan killed my father.

	Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		He found out his partner, Tan, had been
		working for the Triads all along.
			(beat)
		Before my father could prove it, he was
		killed in the line of duty.

				CARTER
		How the hell did Tan get away with it?

				LEE
		All the evidence against him
		disappeared, the smuggling case was
		unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to
		the Triads openly.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,
		Lee, you know my father died on the job. 
		You could have told me...
			(realizing)
		This is about more than all that, isn't
		it?  This is about your Daddy's last
		case, right?

	Lee's caught, fibs badly.

				LEE
		No, no, that would be crazy --

				CARTER
		You thought the "Customs Agents get
		blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
		Tan" and you put it all together and
		came up with a five year old case. 
		That's why you didn't tell me what we
		were doing...

				LEE
		I thought you'd think it was crazy.

				CARTER
		IT IS CRAZY!

				LEE
		I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

	Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
	car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and
	yells.

				CARTER
		So are you getting on the plane or not?!

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		Come on, we still got time to order the
		Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher
		meal, they bring it first.

				LEE
		I cannot go to LA...

	Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
	cop beneath the attitude.

				CARTER
		It sounds impossible --

				LEE
		You said --

				CARTER
		-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
		square up my father's death, I'd go to
		hell to do it.

	Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You want to figure out why they killed
		your Daddy, get on the plane.

				LEE
		Why LA?

				CARTER
			(still not turning)
		I guess you're going to have to trust me
		on this one.
			
			INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

	Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
	passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of
	doubt.

				LEE
		I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a
		boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

				CARTER
		Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
		Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
		the Rich White Man.

				LEE
		Follow the Rich White Man?

				CARTER
		Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
		White Man" all run together like it's
		one word.

				LEE
		Follow the RichWhiteMan...

				CARTER
		Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,
		has a rich white man taking his cut. 
		Every single one.  Now in our case, we
		know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

				LEE
		Who?

				CARTER
		Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky
		Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
		before Ricky got smoked.

				LEE
		How do you know he's our man?

				CARTER
		Because when the shooting started he was
		way too cool.  See most white people,
		when there's shooting, they either hide
		in a toilet or start screaming high
		pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

				LEE
		You sound like that all the time.

				CARTER
		Black people keep their cool when the
		shit goes down.

				LEE
		Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never
		panic.

				CARTER
		Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
		coming?  You people were screaming your
		asses off.

				LEE
		Just tell me where I can find this
		Steven Reign.

				CARTER
		The same place you find all
		RichWhiteMen.
			(a tray arrives)
		Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love
		this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

	CUT TO REVEAL --

	Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

	Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

	INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

	Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
	hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

	Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the
	penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven
	Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the
	door.

	Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
		Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
		his suite at his hotel, I told you this
		would work out.  They still just
		talking?

				LEE
		He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

				CARTER
		He'll be back soon.

				LEE
		How do you know?

				CARTER
		Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,
		I'll take over.

	Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
	sleep on the bed.

				LEE
		Carter, there's something I have to tell
		you.  You were right about what you said
		in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never
		take a day off.  It's all I have right
		now.

				CARTER
		Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

				LEE
		The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
		in six months.

				CARTER
		You pull a muscle or something?

				LEE
		My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
		month before our wedding.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

				LEE
		It's a long story.

				CARTER
		Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
		cop thing -- never knowing if you were
		dead or alive.  I've seen it a million
		times.

				LEE
		No.  It was my singing.

				CARTER
		Excuse me?

				LEE
		She hated my voice.  Said it drove her
		crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in
		bed - in the shower - I thought she
		liked it.  She finally told me it was
		driving her crazy.

	Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

				CARTER
		Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
		our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

	LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's she doing?

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

	She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
	CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee?  You okay?

	Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
	unbutton her blouse.

				LEE
		She's just standing around -- not doing
		much.

				CARTER
		Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later
		something's gonna happen.

				LEE
		I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

	Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat
	as he watches her undress.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Slow down, baby.

				CARTER
		What did you say?

				LEE
		Nothing.  I said nothing.

	Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Is it hot in here?

				CARTER
		Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

				LEE
		I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
		bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

				CARTER
		What's going on?  

	Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

				LEE
		She's getting undressed.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars.

				LEE
		No.  It's not right.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
		you.

	Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
	Carter watches to the window.

				LEE
		What's she doing?

				CARTER
		Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

				LEE
		I don't want to hear this.

				CARTER
		Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra
		and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring
		Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
		there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
		looks like Snoopy.

				LEE
		Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

				CARTER
		She just took her hair down.  Now she's
		going for the bra -- the clasp is in
		front -- she's using both hands.
			(to Lee)
		You better get that ice.

	Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

				LEE
		That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing
		this!

	Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
	living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in
	bra and panties.

				CARTER
		This is our job.  We took an oath as
		police officers.  If we don't do this,
		who will?  Firemen?

	Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees
	Isabella hang up the phone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Wait a sec - what the hell is that
		between her legs?

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		She's reaching into her panties --
		something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,
		God...please don't let it be a dick.

				LEE
		What is it?

				CARTER
		No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
		microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

	CLOSE ON ISABELLA

	As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She
	puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
	and puts on a robe.

				LEE
		I don't understand?

				CARTER
		She's walking back towards the door.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
	hotel room talking with someone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		She opened the door.  Someone is
		delivering a package.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
		package to your office.  It's a bomb!

	Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
	she walks into the bedroom --

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
	entrance of the hotel.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running
	down the hallway.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it
	up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING
	THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

				LEE/CARTER
		NO!

	Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
	panties.

				CARTER
		Damn girl, you fine.

	Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the
	BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
	toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
	floor.

	Nothing happens.

	Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
	CART, about to walk right past the package --

				LEE
		GET DOWN!!

	Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

				CARTER
		Pick it up!

				LEE
		It's your turn!

				CARTER
		I don't need a turn!

	Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
	heading for the elevator.

				LEE
		Throw it!

	Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
	STANDING INSIDE.

				HOTEL GUESTS
		Do you want us to hold the elevator?

				CARTER
		Get the hell away from here!

	Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
	with it --

				LEE
		Stairs!

	Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
	sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

				CARTER
		Get out of the building!

	Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
	choice but to throw it back to Carter.

				LEE
		Roof!

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
	hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
	He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
	are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

				LEE
		Wait!  There's people down there!

				CARTER
		There's people up here!

				LEE
		Get it out of here!

				CARTER
		Take it!

	Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
	and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
	to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
	OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
	off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

				ISABELLA
		Get on your feet.

	Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
	begins to open the package.

				CARTER
		I wouldn't do that!!!

				LEE
		It's a bomb.

	Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
	DOLLAR BILLS.

				ISABELLA
		You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before
		I throw you both in jail for
		obstruction.

				CARTER
		Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you
		right now.

				ISABELLA
		I'm an undercover agent for the United
		States Secret Service.

				CARTER
		How do we know you're not lying?  Let me
		see your badge.

	Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
	her bra.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me see it again?

				LEE
		We can help you.  I'm a detective in
		Hong Kong.

				ISABELLA
		I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

				LEE
		Then you know I'm not walking away from
		this case.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's right.

				ISABELLA
		We need to get out of sight.  Come down
		to my suite.

	INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

				ISABELLA
			(she locks the door)
		Look, I've been working this case for
		months now...

				CARTER
		So what's your story?

				ISABELLA
		They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

	Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
	package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
	food from the mini fridge.

				LEE
		Is this a payoff?

				ISABELLA
		No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard
		of the Superbill?

				CARTER
		It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

				ISABELLA
		It's much more than a counterfeit.  14
		out of 15 world banks can't tell the
		difference.  The paper is Crane linen
		blend -- and the bills are printed on
		U.S. Intaglio presses.

				CARTER
		How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
		to use the presses?

				ISABELLA
		In 1959, the United States was very
		friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We
		wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
		birthday, the government gave him a gift
		-- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The
		only one to ever leave the country. 
		Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
		press on the black market.

				LEE
		Five years ago?!  
			(beat)
		That's right before he left the force.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks.

				ISABELLA
		It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
		this past year.  Then Tan got hold of
		one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
		plates -- and started making superbills.

				LEE
			(understanding)
		And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

				ISABELLA
		Yes.  They've printed and shipped one
		hundred million dollars, and there's
		only one way to spot a fake.

	Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
	RED.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		They use an optical transfer ink from
		India that burns red -- the real ink
		burns black.

				CARTER
		What the hell are they going to do with
		a hundred million dollars in funny
		money?

				ISABELLA
		The real question is, where are the
		plates?  If we can find the plates, we
		can stop the whole operation.

	Isabella thinks for a beat.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Maybe that's where you can help us. 
		Carter, this is your city, right?

	Carter nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

	Lee nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
		plates.
			(hands Lee a card with a phone
			 number)
		Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this
		moment on, you're working for the United
		States Secret Service.

	Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit
	quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on
	Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
	number.

				STERLING (O.S.)
		Sterling.

				ISABELLA
		Lee and Carter are officially out of the
		Secret Service's way...

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
	the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
	Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

				CARTER
		Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my
		calling, Lee. 
		Give me six months and I'll be in
		Washington protecting a white guy.

				LEE
		We both know you would never take a
		bullet for someone else.

				CARTER
		They don't know that.  What are they
		gonna do, try and shoot the President
		during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella
		can pull some strings.  You saw the way
		she was staring at me.

				LEE
		She never even looked at you.

				CARTER
		You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
		me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
		third world ugly.

				LEE
		I am not third world ugly.  Women like
		me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

				CARTER
		Snoopy is about six inches taller than
		you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
		chance.

	Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee
	reluctantly gets in, too.
			
			EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.  

	INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables
	are occupied.

	INT. KITCHEN

	Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
	BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
	worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
	woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half
	Asian kids run around the kitchen.

				CARTER
		Kenny!  How you doin'?

	Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		How's the action tonight?  The house
		making out okay?

	Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

	INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
	big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very
	smokey and very crowded.

				CARTER
			(to Kenny)
		This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
		voice, they all scream and run and shit. 
		Watch.  It's real funny.

	Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

				KENNY
		Come with me.

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

				KENNY
		Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
		Kong, James.

				CARTER
		What??  Where'd you hear that?

				KENNY
		I got my sources.

				CARTER
		And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how
		that works out.
			(beat)
		I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
		place down.

				KENNY
		James, you see my kids back there?  You
		know how much I'm paying for private
		school?  How can you come in here with
		this attitude, you being little Chang's
		godfather?

				CARTER
		Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
		his daddy in jail if you don't
		cooperate.

				KENNY
		Jail!?  James, you better back off. 
		Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

				CARTER
		I'd like to see you try.

	Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
	arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
	countering Kenny's move.

				KENNY
			(to Lee)
		We're on, then.

	Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
	Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

				LEE
			(impressed)
		That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
		did you learn that?

	They switch to Chinese.

				KENNY
		Master Ching taught me.

				LEE
		The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

				KENNY
		No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

	Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing hanging out with Baby
		Duck?

				LEE
		Baby Duck?

				KENNY
		That's what we all used to call him when
		he was a kid -- cause he was always
		quacking.  Never shut up.

				CARTER
		I heard that.

	Lee and Kenny laugh.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, I need some info and I don't have
		time to play around.

				KENNY
		Is this about the funny money?

				CARTER
		How'd you know?

				KENNY
		You've been asking loud questions in all
		the wrong places all morning.  How come
		you always save me for last, James? 
		When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't
		happen I don't know about.

				CARTER
		So tell me what you know.

				KENNY
		I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
		good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
		too, didn't you?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  We already been there.  This is
		big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service
		calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even
		tell the difference.

	Kenny considers this for a moment.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What?

				KENNY
		One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
		dollars at the table here last week.  I
		was about to send my boys down to tune
		his ass up, when the guy comes in and
		pays off the whole thing.  Including the
		vig -- brand new sequential hundred
		dollar bills.  I knew something was
		wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular
		job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
		in cash. 
		But I tested the bills, infrared.  The
		whole thing.  And they checked out. 
		100%.

				LEE
		Do you still have the bills?

				KENNY
		I still have my lunch money from third
		grade.

				CARTER
		Lemme see 'em.

	Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. 
	He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter
	checks it out.

				KENNY
		See.  It's perfect.

	Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		Whoa, what are you doing?

	Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
			(pissed off)
		I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He
		works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

				CARTER
		All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off
		the hook.  For now.

	Carter and Lee move for the door.

				KENNY
		You sure you guys don't want to stay and
		have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu
		shu this side of Compton.

	Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
			
			EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

	Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.

	EXT. REIGN SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee enter.

				CARTER
			(to a worker)
		We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is
		he here?

	Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter
	and Lee exchange looks and run after him.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and
	down some stairs.  Carter and Lee in pursuit.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
	stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

	HU LI

	Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing
	near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER
	in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is
	parked beside it.

	Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of
	the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
	putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink
	without getting mowed down.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
		be remembered for ridding the Triads of
		your petulance.

	Hu Li savors the moment.

				CARTER
		I hope you just said I have no business
		being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

	Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
	freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several
	feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

				ISABELLA
		Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
		want to talk to them first.

	Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee
	falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
	of her gun.

	BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
	the jaw with her fist.

				CARTER
		...oh, that's a filling right there. 
		That's gonna cost you.

	Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

				HU LI
		Put them in the truck.

	The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

				CARTER
		I should kill you right now, but I'm
		gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
		and maybe you can be reformed.

	The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck
		myself.

	As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
	look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
	COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

	The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
	pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

	EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

	The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

	INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

	LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

	They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
	Carter is flexing his battered body.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				CARTER
		What's the first thing I told you --
		never trust nobody.  How could you fall
		for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

				LEE
		She saved our lives.

				CARTER
		For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's
		playing both sides.

	Lee looks disappointed.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a
		thing for her.

				LEE
		Shhh, my head hurts.

				CARTER
		I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"
		me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky
		Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang
		Long are not in South Central.  I didn't
		have to help you.

				LEE
		Why did you help me?

				CARTER
		It doesn't matter.

	Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

				LEE
		I'm not used to having a partner.

				CARTER
		We are not partners.  Between your
		daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just
		took, as far as I can tell all partners
		get you is dead.

				LEE
		Well we're not friends.

				CARTER
		You got that right.  And we ain't
		brothers.  Maybe we should just end this
		right here.

				LEE
		Fine with me.

				CARTER
		I won't talk to you, you don't talk to
		me.  We'll die in peace.

				LEE
		See you in the next world.

	A BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER
		I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I
		won't see you in the next world.

				LEE
		Fine. 

				CARTER
		I believe in heaven.  You people believe
		in heaven?

				LEE
		Yes.  We have heaven.

				CARTER
		Is it the same heaven, or is it a
		Chinese heaven?

				LEE
		What's a Chinese heaven?

				CARTER
		I thought it might be like those five
		foot and under basketball leagues.  They
		don't let everybody in.

				LEE
		I think we should stop talking.

				CARTER
		Fine by me.

	ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You thinking about that girl that dumped
		you?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		If she was the right girl, you'd be
		thinking about her.

				LEE
		Mind your own business.

				CARTER
		How was the sex?

				LEE
		There was no sex.  She was very
		traditional.  We were waiting until we
		were married.

				CARTER
		You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No
		mu-shu?

				LEE
		No mu-shu.

				CARTER
		What about a little king pao chicken?

				LEE
		No kung pao chicken.  Never.

				CARTER
		Steamed dumplings?

				LEE
		Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But
		only when she was drunk.

				CARTER
		That's rough, man.  If I don't get
		steamed dumplings once a week, I go
		crazy.

				LEE
		Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think
		I have a good voice?

				CARTER
		Are you serious?

				LEE
		Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

	Lee turns away from Carter.

				CARTER
		As long as you're asking...I think you
		have a pretty good voice.

				LEE
		I knew it.  What does she know.  You
		want me to sing something?

				CARTER
		That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long
		usually kill their victims?

				LEE
		They'll probably torture us first, shock
		our privates, then put two bullets in
		our eyes and one in the back of the
		head.

				CARTER
		Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

	Lee clears his voice.

				LEE
		Did you happen to see the most beautiful
		girl in the world...and if you did, was
		she crying, crying...hey!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

	The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that
	is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

				HU LI
		Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,
		the dragon's been fed.

	She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best
	to appear completely uninterested.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

	INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

	Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,
	takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
	spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They
	start prying the crate open.

				CARTER
		Very nice.

				LEE
		It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak
		spot.  You ignore everything around you,
		and put all your energy into one perfect
		strike.

				CARTER
		I'll remember that next time I'm
		fighting a box.

	Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about
	$1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hello, Benjamin.

				LEE
		Who's Benjamin?

				CARTER
		Benjamin Franklin, he discovered
		electricity.

				LEE
		A Chinese man discovered electricity.

				CARTER
		No Chinese man discovered electricity.

				LEE
		Yes he did.  He also invented the
		bicycle.

				CARTER
		Now that I believe.

	Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You never know.  Besides, I always
		wanted to die rich.

	The truck lurches.

				LEE
		We're slowing down.  This must be it.

				CARTER
		End of the line.

				LEE
		You've been a good friend, James Carter.

				CARTER
		Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting
		corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass
		from here to Compton.

				LEE
		You could never kick my ass.  You mama's
		boy.

				CARTER
		Don't you talk about my mama.
			(winks at Lee)
		That's more like it.

	EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

	The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's
	approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the
	TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

	Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the
	truck bed is EMPTY.

	Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

	ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

	Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
	bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

	Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
	to the ground.  In the next instant:

	ON LEE

	still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
	onto the roof of the truck.

	ON CARTER

	who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
	use a shield as gunfire erupts.

	Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
	ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
	and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
	the first two guards.

	Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
	CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
	the closest way out:

	A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

	INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the
	underground loading docks.

				LEE
		This way.  I see some lights.

	Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a
	MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that
	lead up to the street.

	EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

	The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.  

	CLOSE ON

	Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
	together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
	VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
	light show in the world.

				LEE
		Vegas...

				CARTER
		Lee.  I just got an idea how someone
		could launder a hundred million dollars
		in cash.

	They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

	A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
	SECONDS.
			
			EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

	FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
	at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
	EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

				LEE
		Red Dragon.

				CARTER
		That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

	Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
	hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the
	rich are making their way inside.

				LEE
		Let's go.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  We can't go in like
		this.  Look at this place, we gotta look
		fly.  We gotta Mac out.

				LEE
		What is Mac out?

				CARTER
		Follow me my Asian brother.

	Carter and Lee start to walk away.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just stay down wind, because I think you
		stepped in some serious rat shit down
		there.

	EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

	INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

				SALESMAN
		May I help you gentlemen?

	Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of
	superbills.

				CARTER
		Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this
		body but pure silk.  And get my partner
		something from the children's
		department.

	Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				SALESMAN
		Would your partner like silk as well?  I
		personally like it when a couple
		matches.

	Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's
		no couple here.  Just two single police
		officers working a very dangerous case.

				LEE
		Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing
		us.

				SALESMAN
		I'm sure all the boys are chasing you
		two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys
		the bell of the ball.

	He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

				CARTER
		This is the last time I go shopping with
		you.

	EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
	tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. 
	Le is awkward in "player" guise.

				CARTER
			(whispering)
		Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You
		own the place.

	Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
	they walk through the doors.

				LEE
		I own the place.

	INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to
	imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT
	BUDDHA --

				CARTER
		That looks exactly like my Uncle
		Darrell.

				LEE
		Buddha is the symbol of luck and good
		fortune.

				CARTER
		Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. 
		The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

	They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA
	COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

	RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The
	MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around
	the perimeter - a sign reads:

				SIGN
		$50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN
	on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

				STEVEN REIGN
		A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
		village in China hired a young Dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  Their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
			(beat)
		Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that
		lost treasure.  It is here, inside the
		greatest casino in the world!  Welcome
		to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a
		winner!

	Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. 
	Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
	waiting.

	A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

	Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on
	the balconies above.

	Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's
	nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down
	the red carpet.

				CARTER
			(to waitress)
		Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...
			(to a cigarette girl)
		Get us a box of your finest cigars.
			(to a change girl)
		Give me ten dollars in nickels.
						
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON

	Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Seven!

	We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

	Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

	GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main
	cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

				CARTER
		Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest
		front in the world.

	As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his
	way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

				LEE
		Carter...here comes the rich white man.

				CARTER
		Wait here.  I'll handle this.

	As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the
	dance floor.

	INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

	The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the
	dance floor lights.

				ISABELLA
		Put your arms around me.

				LEE
		Excuse me?

	Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

				ISABELLA
		Hold me close.  There's cameras
		everywhere.

	An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his
	best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and
	Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her
	face.

				LEE
		What's going on?

				ISABELLA
		I need your help.

				LEE
		Last time you needed my help I ended up
		in the back of a truck.

				ISABELLA
		I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You
		have to trust me.

	Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,
	sensual rhythm.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		You move well.

				LEE
		Just trying to make it look real.

				ISABELLA
		Look over there.  That's the eye in the
		sky room.

	Lee looks over her shoulder. 

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Behind me is the soft count room.  We're
		pretty sure the plates are back there.

				LEE
		Why don't you go get them?

				ISABELLA
		If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

				
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter
	steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

				CARTER
		Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody
		get a picture, we can use it for a mug
		shot.

				STEVEN REIGN
		Detective Carter, you always seem to
		show up where you don't belong.

				CARTER
		Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I
		want the truth.  Is there any way I can
		date your daughter?  Just dinner and a
		movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

				STEVEN REIGN
		Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I
		crawled out from under the first rock. 
		Do you really think you can intimidate
		me here?

				CARTER
		You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most
		counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
		dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure
		genius.

				STEVEN REIGN
		You play games with me, Detective, and
		you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. 
		The odds are always in favor of the
		house.

	Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

	INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

	Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		The Secret Service almost busted Reign
		at his casino in Macao, but the place
		burned down before we could move in.

				LEE
		How do I know I can trust you?

				ISABELLA
		Dip me!

	Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'm asking for real now -- will you help
		the Secret Service?

				LEE
		No.
			(beat)
		But I'll help you.

	Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. 
	He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
	Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

				CARTER
		Lee, what the hell are you doing?

				LEE
		Dancing?

				CARTER
		Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong
		arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the
		line, and you're up here dancing with
		some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

				LEE
		It was Isabella.  She says the plates
		are in the soft count room.

	Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD
	standing in front of a small door.

				CARTER
		Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She
		almost got us killed.  She's setting you
		up again!

				LEE
		No.  I'm going to find out.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  There's guards all over
		the place.  You'll need a distraction.

	Carter looks around the casino.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'll go to the craps table, make a big
		scene.  When security comes over, you
		make your move.  

				LEE
		Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

				CARTER
		I'll give it my best shot.
						
			INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Sir, you're aware that we require a
		fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
		here this weekend?

	Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the
	table.

				CARTER
		I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a
		hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet
		Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,
		people, I came to play.

	The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What the hell is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Those are five hundred dollar chips.

				CARTER
		Did you give me five-hundred dollar
		chips because I'm black?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, I just assumed...

				CARTER
		You assumed a brother coming in here can
		only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
		is that right?  Are you a racist?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, sir.

				CARTER
			(starting to scream)
		Everyone else at the table has thousand
		dollar chips, but the black man gets the
		nickel, is that it?  Did my people
		survive two-hundred years of slavery so
		you could send us back to the cotton
		fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
		Do I look like Chicken George to you?

	The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

				PIT BOSS
		Floor security, we have a problem at
		table nine.

	EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

	The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
	towards Carter's table.

	INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

	TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

				CARTER
		Answer me one question.  How come Ben
		Vereen isn't performing here at the
		hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough
		for you people?

				PIT BOSS
		Lionel Ritchie is performing here
		tonight.

				CARTER
		Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since
		the Commodores.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

	Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way
	into the soft count room.

				CARTER
		I have a dream, where black people and
		white people can gamble together without
		getting different chips!

	A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push
	their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls
	upstairs.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

	Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as
	the Security Guards move in.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you.  Now in the spirit of
		brotherhood, let's play craps!

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
	walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

	He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
	the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
	of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
	trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
	directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
	ceiling.

	WE SEE LEE'S FACE

	as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
	words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

	Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
	of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
	On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
	toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

	Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
	blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
	the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
	Isabella has set him up again.

	He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

				LEE
		Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have
		change for a twenty?

	The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
	down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
	MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
	the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
	right cross.

	Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
	stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
	to Lee's throat.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		Open your mouth.

	She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
	She holds the detonator in her hand.

				HU LI (CONT'D)
			(continuing in Chinese)
		That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. 
		Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
		into your brain.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
	rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner six!

				CARTER
		How much is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Two-hundred thousand!

				CARTER
		Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants
		a hundred dollars?

	Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
	AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Here, your highness, have a hundred
		dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

				GAMBLER
			(South African accent)
		I am not royalty, sir.

				CARTER
		Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My
		great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
		we probably cousins, man.  How much you
		got on the table?

				GAMBLER
		One million.

				CARTER
		Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who
		wants to blow on my hand for luck?

	Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
	YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
		blows on my hand for luck?

				TEXAN
			(embarrassed)
		She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

				CARTER
		Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come
		on, baby, give me some luck.

	The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Nice blowing.  When's your next
		birthday, I'll be the cake.

				TEXAN
		Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

				CARTER
		Don't threaten me.  I got friends in
		this town that will bite off your ears. 
		Just sit tight, because I've got the
		dice and I am on fire!

	Carter throws the dice.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner, seven!

	The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

				CARTER
		Let it ride!
						
			INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
	sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into
	the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
	stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
	casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

	Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
	his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Imagine a business where people hand you
		money.  And you hand them back
		absolutely nothing.

	Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
	Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
	sight of Ricky Tan alive.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Now that's a true American dream. 
		Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
		very greed driven US Customs agent.

	Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You
		know it didn't have to be like this. 
		But it's too bad!  Like father, like
		son.

	Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
	the monitors.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		He's going for the plates.

	Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
	walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
	SUITE.

				RICKY TAN
		Look at this old fool, what does he
		think he's doing?

	Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		It's almost impossible to find a partner
		that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
		you agree, Lee?

	ON ANOTHER SCREEN

	We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
	Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
	Isabella as he goes.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Well, at least you will die with honor. 
		But choy Gien.

	SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
	surrounding him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Four, winner!

				CARTER
		I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
		That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those
		here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me
		out!

	Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
	Carter's table.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
		cashier.

				CARTER
		That would be great.  Don't want any of
		these rich white people to jump me.

	As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
	glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

	Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Chai Hu Li.
			("Little Fox")
		Have fun.

	Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
	plays with the button.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
		this button.

	Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
	blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
	her gun.

	Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
	his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
	knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		It's time to end this, Inspector.

	Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
	from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
	sticking the gun under her chin.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Don't move!  United States Secret
		Service.

	Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
	hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
	the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

	Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
	rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

	THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

	They're about to move in.

				HU LI
		Get the detonator!

	The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
	KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

	One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
	gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
	back.

	Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

	Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CASHIER

	Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

	CRASH!

	An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
	In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

	The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

				CARTER
		Lee!!

	The guards restrain him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lemme ask you something.  Any of you
		ever felt $500,000 before?

	He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
	as the GUARDS hit the floor.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Doesn't feel so good, does it?

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it
	from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES
	OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
	DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
	Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
	detonator on her rounds.

	Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
	BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
	but he does see:

	ACROSS THE CASINO

	Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
	bay with a croupier stick.

				CARTER
		Black man gets on a hot streak and
		you're all trippin'?

	Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same
	simultaneous though:

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(help!)
		Lee!

				LEE
			(help!)
		MMMMMM!!!!

	Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
	But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
	is the HIGH WAY.

	Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
	Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
	He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
	landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
	side.

	Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
	the Sky Room.  He grins.

				CARTER
		Check it out.  Catfight!

	POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the
	floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other
	to get to it first.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
	arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
	plea MUFFLED.

				CARTER
		What the HELL are you doing with tape on
		your face?

	No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
	and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
	and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
	between swings.  Suddenly:

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

	Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
	as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the
	EXITS.

	THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
	on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		This can't be good.

	Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
	high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
	it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

	WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
	the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

	ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
	STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

	The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
	up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
	Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

	Hu Li lifts the detonator.

	Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

	Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

				LEE
			(diving on Carter)
		Bomb!!!

	Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

	KABOOM!

	The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash
	volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. 
	SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

	AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

	Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines. 
	The place is deserted.

				CARTER
		Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
		your mouth?

				LEE
		I did!

				CARTER
		No you didn't!

				LEE
		Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

	A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
			
						LEE (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is alive.

				CARTER
		What?!?!

				LEE
		We have to get to the Penthouse.

	Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
	of the casino.

				CARTER
		Hold on!

	Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
	But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see
	what is holding him up.  

	Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You go after Ricky.  I got this.

				LEE
		Carter...

				CARTER
		Just GO!

	Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE
	TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
	short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

	DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

	Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her
	long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,
	flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'm not gonna hold you back this time
		just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna
		pretend you're a man.

	She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
	undershirt.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		A very beautiful man with a perfect body
		who I'd like to take to the movies.

	She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
	like a master.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I may have been absent the day we went
		over this in karate class.

	Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
	soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for
	another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

	INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

	Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND
	cuts through, parting the doors.

	It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				ISABELLA
		I'm fine.

	She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and
	holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

				LEE
		I didn't know which side you were on.

				ISABELLA
		Now you know.

	DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
	- the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and
	steps into the elevator.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

	The elevator doors close.
			
	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
	HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
	black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
	comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

				RICKY TAN
		American's love to gamble.  Don't they,
		Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
		leaving.

				RICKY TAN
		And my plates?

				STEVEN REIGN
		They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
		have a problem with that.

	Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
	starts to walk toward the door.

				RICKY TAN
		I enjoyed that little story you told
		about the Dragon and the treasure.  My
		mother used to tell it to me all the
		time.  Do you know the moral of that
		story, Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		Greed will imprison us all.

	Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

				RICKY TAN
		I hate that fortune cookie shit.

	Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
	dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.

	Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
	Carter's hands.

				CARTER
		Will you STOP?!?!
			(picks up cocktail umbrella)
		What am I supposed to fight you with?

	No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
	WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
	got nowhere to hide.

	She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
	against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
	kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

	THWACK!

	The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
	she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
	at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

	Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
	HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		When are you people gonna learn?  Don't
		mess with the brothas!

	WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
	reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
	covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Benjamin!

	Carter runs for the elevator.
						
				INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
	body.

				RICKY TAN
		You're just like your father, Lee.  All
		these years hiding behind his badge.  I
		wanted to help him, to share with him,
		but he was too afraid of change.  When
		you think about it, I didn't really kill
		him.  I just put him out of his misery.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.  It's over.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think it's over.  There are
		casinos all over this country.  Let me
		make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
		the same mistake he did.

	Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

				LEE
		If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
		kill you.

				RICKY TAN
		Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

	Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
	taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
	Carter bursts in the room.

				CARTER
		Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
		up, Lee?

	Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
	like this before.

				RICKY TAN
		Would you like me to tell you how your
		father died?

				CARTER
		Lee, you okay?

	Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

				RICKY TAN
		He never begged for his life.  Or tried
		to make a deal.  All that he asked me,
		just seconds before I pulled the
		trigger, was that I promise not to kill
		you.

	Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
	trigger but can't.

				CARTER
		Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
		man.  He's making you do this.

				LEE
		It's worth it to me.

				RICKY TAN
		Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
		gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
		like your father?

				CARTER
		C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
		won, now just put the gun down.

	Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

				RICKY TAN
		That's what I thought.

	Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
	plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

	THE GUN IS LOOSE

	Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

	Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
	SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

	Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
	grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

	But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof. 
	SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
	WINNER!"

	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
	it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		I don't know about you, but I need a
		wine cooler.

	As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
	bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
	This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		We'll go together, Inspector.

				CARTER
		Please tell me she just asked for a ride
		to the airport.

	Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
	and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
	PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

	The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
	of the hotel.

	THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

	Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
	They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
	SIGN.

	It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

	Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
	TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
	The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

				LEE
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit!!

	They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
	and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
	STRETCH LIMO.
						
	INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
	try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
	when they realize they're alive!

				CARTER
		We made it, man.

				LEE
		No problem.

	Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
	OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
	them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
	night on the town.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		Well, there is a God after all.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
	the hotel.

				LIMO DRIVER
		Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

	In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
	CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		We're all going gambling and then to see
		Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are
		feeling lucky!

	INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

	Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
	Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
	Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
	Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

				CARTER
		I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
		You played it cool, though.  Walking
		away, never looking back.

				LEE
		She's going home to New York.  I need
		some ice.

	Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

				CARTER
		That your gate down there?

				LEE
		Yes.

				CARTER
		I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

				LEE
		I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

				CARTER
		You take care of yourself, Lee.

	Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
	like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

				LEE
		Carter, wait.  There's something I want
		you to have.

	Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

				CARTER
		Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I
		can't take this.

				LEE
		It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

	Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

				CARTER
		In that case, I got something for you. 
		I picked it up at the hotel.

	Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

				LEE
		What is this?

				CARTER
		About fifty grand.  I won it at the
		tables.

				LEE
		No, Carter.  I can't take this.

				CARTER
		It's okay, I got lots more.

	Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		They owe us, man.  That's the least they
		can do.

				LEE
		This money is evidence.

				CARTER
		Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
		minutes and live it up.  There must be
		something you want.

	Lee looks back toward Isabella.

				LEE
		I always wanted to go to Madison Square
		Garden.  See the Knicks play.

				CARTER
		New York City?

				LEE
		First class.

				CARTER
		The Plaza Hotel?

				LEE
		A little Mu-shu.

				CARTER
		Some Kung-Pao?

	They look at each other, smile.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I could use a little vacation.

				LEE
		Amen to that, brother.

	As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
	SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
	a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
	their way through the airport.

RUSH HOUR 2

	EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING

	A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like
	watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and
	a half million people a day.

	EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY

	THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 

	HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
	VENDOR across the street.

	She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
	bite we see:

	THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER

	TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball
	erupting over one side of the embassy.

	People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes
	a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned
	street vendor.

				HU LI
			(Chinese, subtitled)
		Someone better call the police.

	EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

	The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in
	a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English
	dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
	look to two girls in a convertible.

				CARTER
			(int Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.

	The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
	is driving and singing to his radio.

				LEE
			(singing)
		...wish they all could be California...
		wish they all could be California
		girls...

	Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
	out of the SUNROOF.

				CARTER
		I warned you about playing that shit
		when I'm in the car.

				LEE
		That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a
		Chinese man's CD.

				CARTER
		Did you see the way those girls drove
		off?  I did you a favor.

				LEE
		Those girls drove off because of you.

				CARTER
		All I did was invite them for a drink.

				LEE
		You invited them to get naked and
		sacrifice a small goat.

				CARTER
			(checking Chinese-English
			 dictionary)
		I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

	Lee picks up his CD case.

				LEE
		You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
		Greatest Hits, Volume Two.

				CARTER
		Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've
		been here three days and we haven't done
		shit.  We haven't been to a club,
		haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on
		vacation, and I want some mu-shu.

				LEE
		Mu-shu?  You're hungry?

				CARTER
		Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some
		women.  Now stop playing dumb and show
		me the shu!

	Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over
	LEE'S CELL PHONE.

	INTERCUT

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, there was a bombing at the American
		Embassy.  Two American translators were
		killed.

				LEE
		Any leads?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(beat)
		We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't
		want to take the case, I'll understand.

				LEE
		It's my responsibility.

	Lee hangs up the cell phone.

				CARTER
		What was that?  Did you just pick up a
		case?  Did we just take another damn
		case on my vacation?

	Lee smiles at Carter.

				LEE
		Of course not.  My Superindendent
		invited us to a club tonight.  Big
		party.

				CARTER
		Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will
		kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard
		you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

				LEE
		Carter, would I lie to you?
						
			EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
	way to the door of the Raven Club.  Carter is combing his
	hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
	when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.

				CARTER
		That's what I'm talking about.  A real
		Hong Kong night club.  You want an
		Altoid?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		You better take one.  Your breath has
		been a little funky all day.  Let me
		look at you.

	Carter looks at Lee.  Fixes his collar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just relax and don't worry about a
		thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You
		got condoms?

				LEE
		No.  

				CARTER
		Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold
		it in half.

	Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
	GIRLS and CIVILIANS.  Lee and Carter walk in.  Lee is trying
	to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
	a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
	Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."

				LEE
		I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. 
		They don't like tourists in here, so try
		to blend in.

				CARTER
		Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than
		everyone here.  Where you going?

				LEE
		Bathroom.

	Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
	the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.

				CARTER
		How you boys doing tonight?

	The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
	OLD MAN continues to sing.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That is the worst singing I've ever
		heard.  That sounds like something you'd
		hear in prison after lights out.

	The thugs continue to ignore Carter.

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
	door - sees a private room.  Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
	MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

				CARTER (V.O.)
		Get closer to my body now.  And just
		love me, till you don't know how...

	Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
	realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
	YOU GET ENOUGH."

	INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
	watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
	Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a
	few of the smitten women who are watching him.

				LEE
			(whispering from side of stage)
		Carter, get off that stage!

				CARTER
		Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a
		star, Lee.  A god to these people!

	Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to
	the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.

				LEE
		This is a gangster bar, we're here
		undercover.

				CARTER
		I knew you were lying.

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		Damn it, why are you ruining my night? 
		I'm just starting to have fun.
			(beat)
		Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
		badge and do your thing.

				LEE
		No, we're here for information, to find
		out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We
		must tread softly and keep our ears
		open.

				CARTER
		Tread softly?  Who taught you how to
		roost a bar?

				LEE
		Carter, you don't understand.  These men
		are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the
		most deadly gang in China.

				CARTER
		Man, are you crazy?  You think that
		scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented
		gangs.  We were having gang wars before
		anybody even thought about it.  We get
		royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme
		your badge and gun and I'll show you how
		it's done.

				LEE
		No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am
		Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.

				CARTER
		You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner
		last night.

	Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. 
	Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
	fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(Chinese)
		Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
		lui.

	Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to
	Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(whispering)
		What'd I say?

				LEE
		You just said you're their worst
		nightmare - and to line their mothers up
		for a milking.

				CARTER
		Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me
		out.

	Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese
	as Carter speaks, Lee translating.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
		to that side, all fine ass women on this
		side.

	Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let's try this again.  Who here knows
		Ricky Tan, raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand.

	Nobody moves.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Now I know you're lying.  

	The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee
	spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage --

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(as they run out)
		I come back and catch y'all singing
		Michael Jackson and you're all going to
		jail.

	EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
	and several gangsters round a corner.

				CARTER
		Stop!  LAPD!

	Lee takes off and chases them on foot.

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

	The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS.  The
	GANGSTERS look around frantically.  An apartment building is
	under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom. 
	Their only way out is UP.

	Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
	SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING.  Lee wastes no time going after
	them.  With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
	VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.

				CARTER
		Hang on, Lee.  I'm coming.

	Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding.  NOT EVEN
	CLOSE.  He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!

	ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS.  They all tear off the
	LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off.  The clatter of wood
	against wood as they beat at each other.  Wrestling over his
	pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.

	BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
	to pull himself up.  Just as he gets his chin above the
	bar... snap!  It BREAKS and he drops.  Then...

	WHAM!  WHAM!  The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
	CARTER.  HE takes one look at their pain.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Forget this...

	He dashes into the stairwell.  ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
	come at Lee.  He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
	SEE-SAWS them off-balance.  With the advantage, he BATTERS
	them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off.  He climbs
	after the GANGSTER LEADER.

	ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS

	Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
	the hill.

	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

	Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
	WHAM!  He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE.  Lee TOPPLES
	OVER THE EDGE!  We see his adversary for the first time.

	HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS

	As she steps to the edge... BOOM!  The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
	OPEN and CARTER EMERGES.  Gun low and ready.  Hu Li is gone.

				CARTER
			(out of breath)
		Freeze!  Nobody move!

	Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below. 
	Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.

	She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
	ROOF!

	He falls along the side of the building.  He manages to grab
	the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.

	LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!

	They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  Hu
	Li looks down at them.  She has no weapon to finish them off. 
	She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

	CARTER AND LEE

	holding on with all their strength.  The bamboo is starting
	to bend.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		All I wanted was a little mu-shu.

				LEE
		Try to land on your feet.

	Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

				CARTER
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit.

	The POLE BREAKS
			
	SUPER THE TITLE:

	RUSH HOUR 2: REMEMBER THE DRAGON

	INT. LEE'S UNMARKED POLICE CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

	Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in
	silence, bruised and covered in garbage.

				CARTER
		You lied to me. 

				LEE
		I'm sorry.

				CARTER
		You're sorry.  I got somebody's old
		chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
		tell me you're sorry.  Just take me
		home.

				LEE
		No time.  There was an explosion at the
		American Embassy today -- two American
		translators were killed.

	Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck.

				CARTER
		So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
		up the Embassy?

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

	Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
	year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

	MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.

				CARTER
		I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
		this shit.  There's two billion Chinese -
		let one of them be your partner.

				LEE
		This won't take long. 

	Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.

				MASTER FU
		Dragon kick!

	Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Lotus block!

	The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu
	notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Twisting Tiger!

	No response.  The students exchange baffled looks.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
			(staring straight at Lee)
		Twisting Tiger!

	Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
	that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in
	the glow...

	...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Didn't I teach you to always arch your
		back?

				LEE
			(bowing, humbled)
		Yes, Master.

	While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
	YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

				CARTER
		I was watching you kids.  My name is
		Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
		black belt.  At least that's what I tell
		the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
		where I work out.

	Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
	reaction.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me give you kids some tips.  The key
		to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why
		don't you stand up.

	THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw
	punches.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show
		you how to block.  Come on, stand up,
		give me your best shot -- try to kick
		right to my head.

	The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
	HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around
	to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of
	the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		That's pretty good.  Which one of you
		kids did that?

	INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Master Fu walking.

				LEE
		I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a
		man who used to train with you.  He's
		become a killer - the worst kind of
		animal.

				MASTER FU
		Animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
		The man you seek is lower than a
		serpent.  
			(faces Lee)
		...he kills for money.

	In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	Carter from all sides.  Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  They
	disappear O.S.

	Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
	thought.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		He was the best I ever trained, you
		know.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan?

				MASTER FU
		No.  Your father.
			(Lee reacts)
		Your father and Ricky Tan were my
		favorite students... and for such awful
		things to happen as they did --

	Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
	uncomfortable.

				LEE
		How do I find Ricky Tan?

	AGAIN IN THE B.G., Carter and the flying kids go zipping by
	in the other direction, disappear O.S.

	Master Fu pats the SOIL around a struggling plant.

				MASTER FU
		A seeding spends its entire life
		reaching towards Heaven.

				LEE
		I know, Master, but...

				MASTER FU
		The answers you seek can be found in
		Heaven on Earth.

				LEE
		Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't
		understand.
			(working it)
		A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A
		mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

				MASTER FU
		It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven
		on Earth."  You will find your answers
		there.

	Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
	pathway.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Put a c-note in the jar.

	Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
	Master Fu walks over and takes the cash.

				MASTER FU (CONT'D)
		Cheap bastard...

	EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two
	students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor
	locked between his legs, holding another two down with his
	hands, and sitting on the last one.

				CARTER
		And that's how you use the LAPD choke
		hold.  Now start practicing and don't
		make me come back here!

				LEE
		Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	A neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor.

				LEE
		Just follow my lead and act like a
		tourist.

				CARTER
		I am a tourist.

	INT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter walk into an upscale MASSAGE PARLOR and stand
	in a lobby.  SOFT MUSIC is playing. 

				HOSTESS
		Good afternoon, gentlemen.

	Lee bows, followed by Carter.

				LEE
			(in Chinese)
		Hello.

				CARTER
		How you doin'?

				LEE
		My friend is on vacation, from America. 
		I want to show him a good time.

				HOSTESS
		Oh, you American?

				CARTER
		That's right.

				HOSTESS
		You bring American money?

				CARTER
			(holding up a Platinum AmEx)
		Never leave home without it.
			(to Lee)
		Lee, this one's on me.  You save your
		money.

	The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN
	SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL
	WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven.

				HOSTESS
		You get massage from Chinese girl
		before?

				CARTER
		No.  It's my first time.

				HOSTESS
		You pick any girl for you and your
		friend.

	Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.

				CARTER
		Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that
		one.

				HOSTESS
		Oh yes, she's very nice.

				CARTER
		She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm
		gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take
		that one, too.  How you doin', baby? 
		And...that one in pink.  She can do my
		feet.

	Lee elbows Carter.

				LEE
		What are you doing?

				CARTER
		She said I could pick any girl I want.

				LEE
		Well, hurry up.

				CARTER
		Hey!  You don't break in front of a
		black man in a buffet line.

				HOSTESS
			(to Lee)
		Your friend have big appetite.
			(handing ROBES to Lee and
			 Carter)
		Please put these on and wait upstairs in
		the quiet room.

	INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY

	TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women
	massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's
	showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the
	background. 

	Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
	PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
	TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
	time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.

				CARTER
		Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come
		through, Lee.

	LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
	SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of
	sophistication and brutality.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's wrong?

				LEE
		Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.

				CARTER
		That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. 
		I'll go over with you right now, shake
		him down.

				LEE
		This is a very dangerous man.

				CARTER
		I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna
		ruin my massage because of some midget
		in a house coat.

				LEE
		I'm calling for back up!

	Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.

	Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
	with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a
	decision, gets up and walks towards him.

				CARTER
		Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
		for you.  Get up.

	Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.

				RICKY TAN
		I'm busy at the moment.

				CARTER
		I said get on your feet!

				RICKY TAN
		I know you, Detective Carter, right? 
		You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying
		your visit?

				CARTER
		I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
		and don't let the robe fool you.  This
		is the only color they had left.  Now
		get up!

	Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop.  CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
	from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
	against the wall.  Ricky glances at his men who are seated
	around the room waiting to move.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I told you to get on your feet!

	Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
	breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.

				RICKY TAN
		Lee, I've missed you, brother.
			(getting up, giving Lee a hug)
		I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
		sorry, you must be under great pressure.

				LEE
		You must come with me for questioning.

				CARTER
		Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken
		and hot oil waiting for me.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think so...

	A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
	towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
	Lee and Carter.  A beat...

				CARTER
		I'd like to pay you for that laptop.

				RICKY TAN
		It's no problem.  But I must excuse
		myself, inspector.

				CARTER
		That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

	Tan bows to Lee and Carter.

				RICKY TAN
		Congratulations.  And good day.

	As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him. 
	But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.

	Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.  The man
	covers his naked body.  Lee is grabbed by one of the other
	henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
	towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
	blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
	the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
	his robe, or some other found object.

	Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
	flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.

				CARTER
			(ref: his privates)
		Damn!  No wonder you're pissed off.

	Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
	the men's punches.

	In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
	flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind. 
	Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men
	throwing him out the front door.

	Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over
	their shoulders.

	EXT. HONG KONG HIGHWAY - DAY

	Ricky Tan's black limo SCREECHES to a stop.  The door flies
	open and Lee and Carter are TOSSED out onto the highway. 
	Both men are completely naked.

	EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

	A packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of
	people.  The CAMERA PANS and we see Lee and Carter from
	behind.

				CARTER
		Goddamn you got a small ass.

				LEE
		Don't look at my ass!

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

	PANDEMONIUM

	The station is packed with Americans -- FBI AGENTS, SECRET
	SERVICE... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
	bullpen.

	SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
	50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Chin, you have been ordered by the
		Ministry of Public Security to assist
		the FBI and Secret Service with our
		investigation, to provide us with
		whatever we need.  If you have
		information, it belongs to us.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		This is still Hong Kong.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Two Americans have been killed on United
		States Government property -- this is
		our investigation.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
		people...

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		No.  He will report to me.  Do we
		understand each other?

	SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. 
	Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
	can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
		Who the hell is that?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
			(humiliated)
		That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The
		detective in charge of our
		investigation.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to
		talk to the great Inspector Lee.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting
	on a suit and fixing his tie. 
	Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
	Lee's closet, then moves for the door.

				LEE
		Where are you going?

				CARTER
		Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn
		passport back.  I'm going home.

				LEE
		Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.

				CARTER
		Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up,
		so I backed you up.  I was about to take
		out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.

				LEE
		Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!

				CARTER
		My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes
		to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! 
		I'm not the one who goes to massage
		parlors to bust crime lords!

				LEE
		It's my job!

				CARTER
		You're pathetic, man.  When's the last
		time you had some fun?  When's the last
		time you took a night off, had a date?

				LEE
		I have plenty of dates.

				CARTER
		Really?  When's the last time you had
		some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when
		was it?  Year of the rat?

				LEE
		You would never understand my life. 
		You're not Chinese.

				CARTER
		And you ain't black!

	The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly
	walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half
	dressed.

	INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin
	stands in the back.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
		the United States Secret Service.

				LEE
		The Secret Service?  Why?

				STERLING
		What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
		this room.  The men who were killed
		yesterday were not American translators. 
		They were undercover U.S. customs agents
		trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. 
		We don't know what they're transporting
		out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
		got the agents killed.

				LEE
		How can we help?

				STERLING
		Stay the hell out of our way.

				LEE
		I can get to Ricky Tan.

				STERLING
		We know all about Tan.  That's why we're
		leaving him out there as bait.  We think
		this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
		and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.

	INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk.  As he talks
	he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it.

				CARTER
		Captain, you're gonna have to speak up. 
		I'm on a car phone!

	INT. CAPTAIN DIEL'S OFFICE - LAPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	CAPTAIN DIEL sits behind his desk talking on the phone.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong
		Kong right now?

				CARTER
		Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm
		in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and
		Vine, two minutes from the station.  How
		about I pick you up right now and take
		you to dinner?

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		It's nine-thirty in the morning.

				CARTER
		Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. 
		Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		Do you know what happened yesterday,
		Carter?  I was officially nominated for
		the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. 
		There was a dinner last night, two
		hundred LAPD officers were there.

				CARTER
		Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez
		there?  He owes me money.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		I've waited my whole life for this job,
		but I don't have a shot in hell of
		getting it.  Do you know why?

				CARTER
		Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You
		tell them there's no crime in being
		lonely.

				CAPTAIN DIEL
		No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is
		because the entire department is about
		to find out the stolen credit cards we
		impounded were used to buy two first
		class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what
		the hell is Heaven on Earth?

				CARTER
		Sir, I'm working on a big case over here
		-- and by the time I get back they're
		gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you
		there?  Hello?  Shit!

	As Carter walks out the DOOR, he brushes past HU LI, who is
	standing in the hallway disguised as a FED EX DELIVERY
	PERSON.  Carter checks her out as he exits.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	CARTER starts walking down the street, making his way past an
	outdoor BUTCHER MARKET, getting strange looks from locals and
	tourists alike.  He motions to an OLD WOMAN who is selling
	LIVE DUCKS, PIGEONS AND CHICKENS

				CARTER
		How you doing?  Can you direct me to the
		Heaven on Earth massage parlor?  

	The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES
	filled with birds.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, I don't eat live birds.  I like my
		birds dead and deep fried.  You ever
		been to Popeyes?

	The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No, don't do that, I had a big lunch. 
		I'm warning you, I'm a police officer --
		just put the blade down and let the bird
		go.

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN/LEE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Lee walks out of the Captain's office, heads for his own
	office - but never gets there.

	AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station. 
	Lee diving for safety as glass and debris shoot over his
	head.  Sheer pandemonium as Lee quickly looks up at his
	destroyed office, tries to get to his feet.

	STUNNED POLICE OFFICERS and DETECTIVES are crowded around
	Lee's office, looking at the rubble.  Lee pushes through the
	crowd -- it's all smoke and fire.  Now way anyone held back
	by the heat.

				LEE
		Carter!  CARTER!

	EXT. HONG KONG STREET - DAY

	Carter walks down the street holding a CAGE WITH A LIVE RED
	BIRD inside.  He stops a MAN who is sweeping in front of his
	store.

				CARTER
		How you doing?  I'm looking for Heaven
		on Earth.

	The man stares at Carter, watches as he pulls out his:

	ENGLISH/CHINESE DICTIONARY

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Shan-shui cao guo-jiu, pao gai niu tao
		zi.

				MAN
		You wish to spank my sister with a ping
		pong paddle?

				CARTER
		No man, I was just asking...

				MAN
		Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake.

	As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off.

	Pause.

	Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see
	if it's worth staying...

	INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY

	Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin
	approaches.

				LEE
		All he wanted was some mu-shu.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Are you okay, Lee?

	Beat.

				LEE
		I'm sorry, I have to go.

	EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON

	Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving
	for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks
	to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a
	waiting Daimler.

	The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the
	street with a determined look on his face.

				CARTER
		I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi!

	Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat.

	INT. TAXI - EVENING

	The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo.

				CARTER
			(loud)
		Follow that limo.

	The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You understand what I'm saying?  Follow
		that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This
		is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
			(beat)
		We are still parked -- we're not moving! 
		This is the opposite of chasing -- drive
		the car or I will kill you!

	The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes
	in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

				CAB DRIVER
		Now you speak my language.
			
	INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

	Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. 
	Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in
	tribute to Carter.

	His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music.

	INTERCUT -- 

	INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Lee, we just got a call from the harbor
		patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little
		party on his boat tonight.  Victoria
		harbor.  If you don't want to...

				LEE
		Did you tell Sterling?

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		Let him find out on his own.  I want the
		Hong Kong police handling this.

				LEE
		Thank you.

	Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC
	up, a man on a mission.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

	A 190-FOOT YACHT is anchored in Victoria Harbor.  Ricky Tan
	walks along the top deck with HU LI, disappearing into a
	crowd of people who are partying on the ship.

	Carter steps out of the cab.

				CARTER
		Stay here.  I'll be right back.  You
		understand?

				CAB DRIVER
		Yes.  I understand.

	Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off,
	leaving him alone on the docks.

	Carter looks around the dock -- a pull up valet station
	parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
	names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,
	politicians and beautiful women - a who's who of Hong Kong.

	CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN
	HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.

				DOORMAN #1
		Invitation, please.

				CARTER
		I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

				DOORMAN #1
		The band has been playing over an hour.

				CARTER
		I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. 
		Ricky here yet, I need to get his
		requests.

	As Carter walks past the doorman -- 

				DOORMAN #1
		Wait.

				CARTER
		Last party all he wanted was Sting --
		not one person danced.  Tonight I'm
		doing Superfreak, I don't care what he
		says.  Where is he?

				DOORMAN #1
		Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the
		help.

	Carter turns back to the doorman, grabs him by the collar.

				CARTER
		Help?  I'm not the help, man -- I'm the
		star.  That's my band up there -- I
		control the mood, the groove, the
		atmosphere.

	Carter cuts a smoking DANCE MOVE.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Can you do that?
			(man shakes head "no")
		That's why you're down here and I'm up
		there.  Now this is my party -- don't
		forget it!

	Carter walks onto the ship, starts singing to himself.

	EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

	The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea. 
	Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
	the slip.  He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
	but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
	side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.  He
	clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
	LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --

	EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS

	As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
	from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
	- almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
	REIGN.  Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
	impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
	money. 
	He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
	Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
	as sociopath.

	Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li.  Carter
	hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
	for signs of trouble.  He heads into the main party.

	Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
	stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
	champagne.  Carter lights her cigarette for her.

				CARTER
		How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince
		Mubutu from Nigeria.

				ISABELLA
		Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That
		seat is taken.

				CARTER
			(in mangled Spanish)
		San Juan!  You must know my good friend
		Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector
		Elizondo.

				ISABELLA
			(in English)
		I don't think so.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
		in the best circles.  But hey, I
		understand.  Make yourself at home,
		Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever
		you want.  My ship is your ship.

				ISABELLA
		This is your ship?

				CARTER
		That's right.  I'm the owner, the
		Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.

				ISABELLA
		El Capitan?

				CARTER
		I don't want to play games with you,
		Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself
		with you -- in one of those bathrooms
		over there in about five minutes.

				ISABELLA
		Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a
		beautiful yacht.  What's it called?

				CARTER
		Called?  What's my ship called?
			(he has no idea)
		Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
		Johnson.

				ISABELLA
		The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name
		on the back was "Red Dragon."

				CARTER
		Red Dragon?  You sure about that?

				ISABELLA
		I'm sure, because this is my friend's
		yacht.  And it's his party.

				CARTER
		Your friend's ship?
			(looking around)
		Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the
		wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason
		my keys didn't work.

				STEVEN REIGN
			(taking seat next to Isabella)
		Who's your friend?

				ISABELLA
		Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? 
		You're big time.  You own all them big
		hotels.  What are you doing in Hong
		Kong?

				STEVEN REIGN
			(ushering away Isabella)
		I'm just in town for the weekend, taking
		in the sights.

				ISABELLA
		Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter.

	Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. 
	Carter's watching.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a
	BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the
	throat, pushing him against the wall.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan.  Where is he?

				BODYGUARD #1
		Who's asking?

				LEE
		The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a
		detective today and he's not getting
		away with it.  Now where is he?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or
		we'll kick your lying ass!

	Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing
	right behind him.

				LEE
		Carter?

				CARTER
		Who died?

				LEE
		You.

				CARTER
		Detective Yu?  Never met him.

				LEE
		Not Yu.  You!

				CARTER
		Who?

				LEE
		Do you understand the words that are
		coming out of my mouth?

				CARTER
		Nobody understands the words that are
		coming out of your mouth.

				BODYGUARD #1
		Get your hands in the air.

	Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front
	of them with GUNS in hand.

				BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is expecting you.
			
			INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED
	and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen
	satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door
	and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom.

				RICKY TAN
		Come on, Shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
		You can do it, big guy.

	ON TV

	We see Shaq miss his free throw.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Shit!  He still doesn't follow through. 
		I just lost five grand.

	Tan turns off the TV, turns to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Why don't we go on the deck, get some
		air...and some privacy.
			(to Hu Li)
		Leave us alone.

	Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Could you have your partner wait for us
		outside?

				CARTER
		I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I
		got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

				LEE
			(to Carter)
		I'll meet you on the main deck in ten
		minutes.

	Carter pulls Lee aside.

				CARTER
		What, leave you alone so he can cap you?

				LEE
		I'm okay, you go.

				CARTER
		Why the hell should you believe him?  He
		had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty
		shit.

				LEE
		Remember I told you my father was a
		policeman?
			(beat)
		Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		What the hell is going on here?

	No answer.  Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns
	and walks the other way.

	EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT

	Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.

				RICKY TAN
		Despite what people suspect...what you
		suspect --

				LEE
		Don't.

	Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it.

				RICKY TAN
		... if your father were alive, I would
		be turning to him now.
			(beat)
		I didn't blow up the American Embassy,
		but I believe some of my people did.  My
		enemies are trying to frame me.
			(beat)
		There is a war going on within the
		Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My
		name has been written into the book of
		death.

				LEE
		The police can protect you.

				RICKY TAN
		Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal
		with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get
		me out of Hong Kong.

				LEE
		Tell me why they killed the customs
		agents.

				RICKY TAN
		There is a ship, in the Hong Kong
		Harbor...

	Hu Li BURSTS onto the deck, flanked by FOUR BODYGUARDS.

	Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese.  Hu Li
	screams back as SHE EMPTIES HER GUN INTO RICKY'S CHEST.  Tan
	falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

	Lee MOVES TOWARDS HU LI, but the four bodyguards are on Lee,
	attacking from all sides.  Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight
	off the bodyguards.

	INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

	Reactions from the crowd as GUNSHOTS echo from the deck
	above.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and
	suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.

	It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED
	Hu Li with his leg.

				CARTER
		All right, get your hands up.

	Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head.

	EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on
	one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and
	Bodyguard #2.

	INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Hu Li face off.

				CARTER
		You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give
		you a little LAPD ass kickin'.

	Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows.

	INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS

	Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches
	his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines.

				LEE
		Hu Li!

	Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT
	starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the
	moving boat.

	Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the
	stern.
			
	EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time --
	watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat.

	Carter turns his head, sees --

	-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li
	escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should
	during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears
	back into the shadows.

	EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

	The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. 
	Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks.

	Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock.

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was
		our only bait, and now he's gone.  You
		finally got your revenge - at the
		expense of a U.S. Government
		investigation.

				CARTER
		What "revenge" is he talking about?

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid
		you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was
		a pure vendetta killing -- but you're
		off this case.  I don't ever want to see
		you again, you got that?

				CARTER
		Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are
		you --

				SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
		Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going
		back to L.A.

				CARTER
		Fine with me.

	Sterling walks away disgusted.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
		I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to
		fully cooperate with the Secret Service.

	Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin
	motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to
	approach.

				SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D)
			(to police officers)
		Escort Detective Carter to the airport --

				LEE
		I'll take him.

				CARTER
		Hell no.

	The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(to Lee)
		Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to
		you.

	Carter stalks off.

				LEE
		Don't push me, Carter.  I'm in no mood
		for your bullshit.

	Carter gets in Lee's face.  The two men look like they're
	about to come to blows.

				CARTER
		What are you gonna do about it,
		grasshopper?

				LEE
		I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

				CARTER
		Give me your best shot, you flat assed
		mama's boy.

				LEE
		Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my
		ass!

				CARTER
		I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.

				LEE
		No.  She's a school teacher.

				CARTER
		You're not very good at this, are you?

				LEE
		Good at what?   

				CARTER
		Forget it.

	A long beat while Lee considers what to say.

				LEE
		Five years ago, my father was Chief
		Inspector working a big international
		smuggling case.

				CARTER
		Ask me if I give a shit.

	Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.

				LEE
		Ricky Tan killed my father.

	Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		He found out his partner, Tan, had been
		working for the Triads all along.
			(beat)
		Before my father could prove it, he was
		killed in the line of duty.

				CARTER
		How the hell did Tan get away with it?

				LEE
		All the evidence against him
		disappeared, the smuggling case was
		unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to
		the Triads openly.

				CARTER
			(pause)
		This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell,
		Lee, you know my father died on the job. 
		You could have told me...
			(realizing)
		This is about more than all that, isn't
		it?  This is about your Daddy's last
		case, right?

	Lee's caught, fibs badly.

				LEE
		No, no, that would be crazy --

				CARTER
		You thought the "Customs Agents get
		blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
		Tan" and you put it all together and
		came up with a five year old case. 
		That's why you didn't tell me what we
		were doing...

				LEE
		I thought you'd think it was crazy.

				CARTER
		IT IS CRAZY!

				LEE
		I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

	Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
	car.  Carter watches him.  Finally he rolls his eyes and
	yells.

				CARTER
		So are you getting on the plane or not?!

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		Come on, we still got time to order the
		Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher
		meal, they bring it first.

				LEE
		I cannot go to LA...

	Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
	cop beneath the attitude.

				CARTER
		It sounds impossible --

				LEE
		You said --

				CARTER
		-- but if somebody gave me the chance to
		square up my father's death, I'd go to
		hell to do it.

	Carter turns, walks away without looking back.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You want to figure out why they killed
		your Daddy, get on the plane.

				LEE
		Why LA?

				CARTER
			(still not turning)
		I guess you're going to have to trust me
		on this one.
			
			INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT

	Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
	passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of
	doubt.

				LEE
		I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a
		boat in Hong Kong Harbor...

				CARTER
		Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
		Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
		the Rich White Man.

				LEE
		Follow the Rich White Man?

				CARTER
		Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
		White Man" all run together like it's
		one word.

				LEE
		Follow the RichWhiteMan...

				CARTER
		Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere,
		has a rich white man taking his cut. 
		Every single one.  Now in our case, we
		know the rich white man is Steven Reign.

				LEE
		Who?

				CARTER
		Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky
		Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
		before Ricky got smoked.

				LEE
		How do you know he's our man?

				CARTER
		Because when the shooting started he was
		way too cool.  See most white people,
		when there's shooting, they either hide
		in a toilet or start screaming high
		pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!

				LEE
		You sound like that all the time.

				CARTER
		Black people keep their cool when the
		shit goes down.

				LEE
		Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never
		panic.

				CARTER
		Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
		coming?  You people were screaming your
		asses off.

				LEE
		Just tell me where I can find this
		Steven Reign.

				CARTER
		The same place you find all
		RichWhiteMen.
			(a tray arrives)
		Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love
		this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL

	CUT TO REVEAL --

	Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars.

	Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE:

	INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT

	Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down
	hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL

	Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the
	penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven
	Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the
	door.

	Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
		Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
		his suite at his hotel, I told you this
		would work out.  They still just
		talking?

				LEE
		He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

				CARTER
		He'll be back soon.

				LEE
		How do you know?

				CARTER
		Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour,
		I'll take over.

	Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
	sleep on the bed.

				LEE
		Carter, there's something I have to tell
		you.  You were right about what you said
		in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never
		take a day off.  It's all I have right
		now.

				CARTER
		Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.

				LEE
		The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
		in six months.

				CARTER
		You pull a muscle or something?

				LEE
		My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
		month before our wedding.

				CARTER
		I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

				LEE
		It's a long story.

				CARTER
		Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
		cop thing -- never knowing if you were
		dead or alive.  I've seen it a million
		times.

				LEE
		No.  It was my singing.

				CARTER
		Excuse me?

				LEE
		She hated my voice.  Said it drove her
		crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in
		bed - in the shower - I thought she
		liked it.  She finally told me it was
		driving her crazy.

	Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.

				CARTER
		Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
		our personal lives.  Let's die curious.

	LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What's she doing?

	BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA

	She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
	CURTAINS.  Slowly taking off her coat.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee?  You okay?

	Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
	unbutton her blouse.

				LEE
		She's just standing around -- not doing
		much.

				CARTER
		Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later
		something's gonna happen.

				LEE
		I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

	Isabella starts to remove her blouse.  Lee starting to sweat
	as he watches her undress.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Slow down, baby.

				CARTER
		What did you say?

				LEE
		Nothing.  I said nothing.

	Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.

				LEE (CONT'D)
		Is it hot in here?

				CARTER
		Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.

				LEE
		I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
		bucket of ice.  You want some ice?

				CARTER
		What's going on?  

	Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.

				LEE
		She's getting undressed.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars.

				LEE
		No.  It's not right.

				CARTER
		Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
		you.

	Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
	Carter watches to the window.

				LEE
		What's she doing?

				CARTER
		Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

				LEE
		I don't want to hear this.

				CARTER
		Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra
		and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring
		Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec -
		there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
		looks like Snoopy.

				LEE
		Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.

				CARTER
		She just took her hair down.  Now she's
		going for the bra -- the clasp is in
		front -- she's using both hands.
			(to Lee)
		You better get that ice.

	Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.

				LEE
		That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing
		this!

	Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
	living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in
	bra and panties.

				CARTER
		This is our job.  We took an oath as
		police officers.  If we don't do this,
		who will?  Firemen?

	Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees
	Isabella hang up the phone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Wait a sec - what the hell is that
		between her legs?

				LEE
		What?

				CARTER
		She's reaching into her panties --
		something is strapped to her leg.  Oh,
		God...please don't let it be a dick.

				LEE
		What is it?

				CARTER
		No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
		microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

	CLOSE ON ISABELLA

	As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She
	puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
	and puts on a robe.

				LEE
		I don't understand?

				CARTER
		She's walking back towards the door.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
	hotel room talking with someone.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		She opened the door.  Someone is
		delivering a package.

	BINOCULARS P.O.V.

	Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
		package to your office.  It's a bomb!

	Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Isabella closes the door.  She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
	she walks into the bedroom --

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
	entrance of the hotel.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running
	down the hallway.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it
	up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come BURSTING
	THROUGH the BEDROOM DOOR.

				LEE/CARTER
		NO!

	Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
	panties.

				CARTER
		Damn girl, you fine.

	Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the
	BOMB, Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom.

	INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
	toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
	floor.

	Nothing happens.

	Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
	CART, about to walk right past the package --

				LEE
		GET DOWN!!

	Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.

				CARTER
		Pick it up!

				LEE
		It's your turn!

				CARTER
		I don't need a turn!

	Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
	heading for the elevator.

				LEE
		Throw it!

	Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
	STANDING INSIDE.

				HOTEL GUESTS
		Do you want us to hold the elevator?

				CARTER
		Get the hell away from here!

	Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
	with it --

				LEE
		Stairs!

	Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
	sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.

				CARTER
		Get out of the building!

	Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
	choice but to throw it back to Carter.

				LEE
		Roof!

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
	hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. 
	He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
	are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.

				LEE
		Wait!  There's people down there!

				CARTER
		There's people up here!

				LEE
		Get it out of here!

				CARTER
		Take it!

	Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
	and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
	to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
	OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
	off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.

				ISABELLA
		Get on your feet.

	Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
	begins to open the package.

				CARTER
		I wouldn't do that!!!

				LEE
		It's a bomb.

	Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
	DOLLAR BILLS.

				ISABELLA
		You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before
		I throw you both in jail for
		obstruction.

				CARTER
		Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you
		right now.

				ISABELLA
		I'm an undercover agent for the United
		States Secret Service.

				CARTER
		How do we know you're not lying?  Let me
		see your badge.

	Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
	her bra.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Let me see it again?

				LEE
		We can help you.  I'm a detective in
		Hong Kong.

				ISABELLA
		I know who you are, Inspector Lee.

				LEE
		Then you know I'm not walking away from
		this case.

				CARTER
		Yeah, that's right.

				ISABELLA
		We need to get out of sight.  Come down
		to my suite.

	INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER

				ISABELLA
			(she locks the door)
		Look, I've been working this case for
		months now...

				CARTER
		So what's your story?

				ISABELLA
		They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

	Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
	package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
	food from the mini fridge.

				LEE
		Is this a payoff?

				ISABELLA
		No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard
		of the Superbill?

				CARTER
		It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.

				ISABELLA
		It's much more than a counterfeit.  14
		out of 15 world banks can't tell the
		difference.  The paper is Crane linen
		blend -- and the bills are printed on
		U.S. Intaglio presses.

				CARTER
		How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
		to use the presses?

				ISABELLA
		In 1959, the United States was very
		friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We
		wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
		birthday, the government gave him a gift
		-- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The
		only one to ever leave the country. 
		Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
		press on the black market.

				LEE
		Five years ago?!  
			(beat)
		That's right before he left the force.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks.

				ISABELLA
		It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
		this past year.  Then Tan got hold of
		one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
		plates -- and started making superbills.

				LEE
			(understanding)
		And Hu Li killed him for the plates.

				ISABELLA
		Yes.  They've printed and shipped one
		hundred million dollars, and there's
		only one way to spot a fake.

	Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
	RED.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		They use an optical transfer ink from
		India that burns red -- the real ink
		burns black.

				CARTER
		What the hell are they going to do with
		a hundred million dollars in funny
		money?

				ISABELLA
		The real question is, where are the
		plates?  If we can find the plates, we
		can stop the whole operation.

	Isabella thinks for a beat.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Maybe that's where you can help us. 
		Carter, this is your city, right?

	Carter nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?

	Lee nods.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
		plates.
			(hands Lee a card with a phone
			 number)
		Welcome aboard, gentlemen.  From this
		moment on, you're working for the United
		States Secret Service.

	Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out.  They exit
	quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  CAMERA STAYS on
	Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
	number.

				STERLING (O.S.)
		Sterling.

				ISABELLA
		Lee and Carter are officially out of the
		Secret Service's way...

	EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
	the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
	Agents.  They approach Carter's parked VETTE.

				CARTER
		Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my
		calling, Lee. 
		Give me six months and I'll be in
		Washington protecting a white guy.

				LEE
		We both know you would never take a
		bullet for someone else.

				CARTER
		They don't know that.  What are they
		gonna do, try and shoot the President
		during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella
		can pull some strings.  You saw the way
		she was staring at me.

				LEE
		She never even looked at you.

				CARTER
		You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
		me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
		third world ugly.

				LEE
		I am not third world ugly.  Women like
		me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.

				CARTER
		Snoopy is about six inches taller than
		you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
		chance.

	Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette.  Lee
	reluctantly gets in, too.
			
			EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall.  

	INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables
	are occupied.

	INT. KITCHEN

	Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
	BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
	worked waiter.  Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
	woman, works the stove.  A couple of cute half-black, half
	Asian kids run around the kitchen.

				CARTER
		Kenny!  How you doin'?

	Kenny looks up at Carter.  A cool, appraising glance.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		How's the action tonight?  The house
		making out okay?

	Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --

	INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
	big money.  Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside.  It's very
	smokey and very crowded.

				CARTER
			(to Kenny)
		This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
		voice, they all scream and run and shit. 
		Watch.  It's real funny.

	Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.

				KENNY
		Come with me.

	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.

				KENNY
		Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
		Kong, James.

				CARTER
		What??  Where'd you hear that?

				KENNY
		I got my sources.

				CARTER
		And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how
		that works out.
			(beat)
		I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
		place down.

				KENNY
		James, you see my kids back there?  You
		know how much I'm paying for private
		school?  How can you come in here with
		this attitude, you being little Chang's
		godfather?

				CARTER
		Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
		his daddy in jail if you don't
		cooperate.

				KENNY
		Jail!?  James, you better back off. 
		Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.

				CARTER
		I'd like to see you try.

	Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
	arts move.  Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
	countering Kenny's move.

				KENNY
			(to Lee)
		We're on, then.

	Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
	Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.

				LEE
			(impressed)
		That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
		did you learn that?

	They switch to Chinese.

				KENNY
		Master Ching taught me.

				LEE
		The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

				KENNY
		No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

	Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		What are you doing hanging out with Baby
		Duck?

				LEE
		Baby Duck?

				KENNY
		That's what we all used to call him when
		he was a kid -- cause he was always
		quacking.  Never shut up.

				CARTER
		I heard that.

	Lee and Kenny laugh.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, I need some info and I don't have
		time to play around.

				KENNY
		Is this about the funny money?

				CARTER
		How'd you know?

				KENNY
		You've been asking loud questions in all
		the wrong places all morning.  How come
		you always save me for last, James? 
		When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't
		happen I don't know about.

				CARTER
		So tell me what you know.

				KENNY
		I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
		good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
		too, didn't you?

				CARTER
		Yeah.  We already been there.  This is
		big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service
		calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even
		tell the difference.

	Kenny considers this for a moment.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What?

				KENNY
		One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
		dollars at the table here last week.  I
		was about to send my boys down to tune
		his ass up, when the guy comes in and
		pays off the whole thing.  Including the
		vig -- brand new sequential hundred
		dollar bills.  I knew something was
		wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular
		job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
		in cash. 
		But I tested the bills, infrared.  The
		whole thing.  And they checked out. 
		100%.

				LEE
		Do you still have the bills?

				KENNY
		I still have my lunch money from third
		grade.

				CARTER
		Lemme see 'em.

	Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE. 
	He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill.  Carter
	checks it out.

				KENNY
		See.  It's perfect.

	Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
		Whoa, what are you doing?

	Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.

				KENNY (CONT'D)
			(pissed off)
		I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He
		works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

				CARTER
		All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off
		the hook.  For now.

	Carter and Lee move for the door.

				KENNY
		You sure you guys don't want to stay and
		have a bite?  My wife's got the best mu
		shu this side of Compton.

	Carter and Lee exchange a look as we CUT TO:
			
			EXT. REIGN PLAZA - DAY

	Establishing.  Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside.

	EXT. REIGN SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee enter.

				CARTER
			(to a worker)
		We're looking for a guy named Zing.  Is
		he here?

	Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them.  Then RUNS.  Carter
	and Lee exchange looks and run after him.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and
	down some stairs.  Carter and Lee in pursuit.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

	Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the
	stairway -- coming almost face to face with --

	HU LI

	Who has her gun out.  Waiting for them.  ISABELLA is standing
	near by, and ZING is visible off to the side.  An 18-WHEELER
	in the loading bay is just being shut and locked.  A LIMO is
	parked beside it.

	Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions.  When most of
	the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,
	putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.  They can't blink
	without getting mowed down.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
		be remembered for ridding the Triads of
		your petulance.

	Hu Li savors the moment.

				CARTER
		I hope you just said I have no business
		being here, 'cos I was just leaving.

	Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,
	freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several
	feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.

				ISABELLA
		Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
		want to talk to them first.

	Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee
	falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt
	of her gun.

	BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
	the jaw with her fist.

				CARTER
		...oh, that's a filling right there. 
		That's gonna cost you.

	Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.

				HU LI
		Put them in the truck.

	The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.

				CARTER
		I should kill you right now, but I'm
		gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine,
		and maybe you can be reformed.

	The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck
		myself.

	As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a
	look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li
	COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun.

	EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY

	The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car
	pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway.

	EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY

	The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.

	INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY

	LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY.

	They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. 
	Carter is flexing his battered body.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				CARTER
		What's the first thing I told you --
		never trust nobody.  How could you fall
		for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.

				LEE
		She saved our lives.

				CARTER
		For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's
		playing both sides.

	Lee looks disappointed.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a
		thing for her.

				LEE
		Shhh, my head hurts.

				CARTER
		I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh"
		me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky
		Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang
		Long are not in South Central.  I didn't
		have to help you.

				LEE
		Why did you help me?

				CARTER
		It doesn't matter.

	Lee thinks about this for a BEAT.

				LEE
		I'm not used to having a partner.

				CARTER
		We are not partners.  Between your
		daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just
		took, as far as I can tell all partners
		get you is dead.

				LEE
		Well we're not friends.

				CARTER
		You got that right.  And we ain't
		brothers.  Maybe we should just end this
		right here.

				LEE
		Fine with me.

				CARTER
		I won't talk to you, you don't talk to
		me.  We'll die in peace.

				LEE
		See you in the next world.

	A BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER
		I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I
		won't see you in the next world.

				LEE
		Fine. 

				CARTER
		I believe in heaven.  You people believe
		in heaven?

				LEE
		Yes.  We have heaven.

				CARTER
		Is it the same heaven, or is it a
		Chinese heaven?

				LEE
		What's a Chinese heaven?

				CARTER
		I thought it might be like those five
		foot and under basketball leagues.  They
		don't let everybody in.

				LEE
		I think we should stop talking.

				CARTER
		Fine by me.

	ANOTHER BEAT OF SILENCE

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You thinking about that girl that dumped
		you?

				LEE
		No.

				CARTER
		If she was the right girl, you'd be
		thinking about her.

				LEE
		Mind your own business.

				CARTER
		How was the sex?

				LEE
		There was no sex.  She was very
		traditional.  We were waiting until we
		were married.

				CARTER
		You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No
		mu-shu?

				LEE
		No mu-shu.

				CARTER
		What about a little king pao chicken?

				LEE
		No kung pao chicken.  Never.

				CARTER
		Steamed dumplings?

				LEE
		Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But
		only when she was drunk.

				CARTER
		That's rough, man.  If I don't get
		steamed dumplings once a week, I go
		crazy.

				LEE
		Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think
		I have a good voice?

				CARTER
		Are you serious?

				LEE
		Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

	Lee turns away from Carter.

				CARTER
		As long as you're asking...I think you
		have a pretty good voice.

				LEE
		I knew it.  What does she know.  You
		want me to sing something?

				CARTER
		That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long
		usually kill their victims?

				LEE
		They'll probably torture us first, shock
		our privates, then put two bullets in
		our eyes and one in the back of the
		head.

				CARTER
		Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

	Lee clears his voice.

				LEE
		Did you happen to see the most beautiful
		girl in the world...and if you did, was
		she crying, crying...hey!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

	The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO.

	INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

	Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that
	is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone.

				HU LI
		Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes,
		the dragon's been fed.

	She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best
	to appear completely uninterested.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER.

	INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS

	Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up,
	takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet
	spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They
	start prying the crate open.

				CARTER
		Very nice.

				LEE
		It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak
		spot.  You ignore everything around you,
		and put all your energy into one perfect
		strike.

				CARTER
		I'll remember that next time I'm
		fighting a box.

	Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about
	$1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hello, Benjamin.

				LEE
		Who's Benjamin?

				CARTER
		Benjamin Franklin, he discovered
		electricity.

				LEE
		A Chinese man discovered electricity.

				CARTER
		No Chinese man discovered electricity.

				LEE
		Yes he did.  He also invented the
		bicycle.

				CARTER
		Now that I believe.

	Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You never know.  Besides, I always
		wanted to die rich.

	The truck lurches.

				LEE
		We're slowing down.  This must be it.

				CARTER
		End of the line.

				LEE
		You've been a good friend, James Carter.

				CARTER
		Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting
		corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass
		from here to Compton.

				LEE
		You could never kick my ass.  You mama's
		boy.

				CARTER
		Don't you talk about my mama.
			(winks at Lee)
		That's more like it.

	EXT. 18-WHEELER - CONTINUOUS

	The truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  It's
	approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.  Soldier #1 opens the
	TRUCK'S DOUBLE DOORS to find.

	Lee and Carter are gone.  Except for boxes of money, the
	truck bed is EMPTY.

	Two soldiers enter the truck bed.

	ANGLE UP TO REVEAL

	Lee and Carter WEDGED up against the CEILING of the truck
	bed.  Above the doors and over the soldiers.

	Lee and Carter SWING DOWN in unison -- knocking both soldiers
	to the ground.  In the next instant:

	ON LEE

	still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
	onto the roof of the truck.

	ON CARTER

	who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
	use a shield as gunfire erupts.

	Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
	ground.  He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield
	and together THEY SWING him into the truck -- KNOCKING DOWN
	the first two guards.

	Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them
	CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
	the closest way out:

	A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.

	INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the
	underground loading docks.

				LEE
		This way.  I see some lights.

	Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a
	MANHOLE COVER.  They start climbing up the metal stairs that
	lead up to the street.

	EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. - DUSK

	The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS.  

	CLOSE ON

	Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
	together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS
	VEGAS STRIP.  They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
	light show in the world.

				LEE
		Vegas...

				CARTER
		Lee.  I just got an idea how someone
		could launder a hundred million dollars
		in cash.

	They both turn around and come FACE TO FACE WITH:

	A TEN-STORY DRAGON.  Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
	SECONDS.
			
			EXT. RED DRAGON HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

	FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up
	at the RED DRAGON.  The HUGE NEON SIGN READS: GRAND OPENING -
	EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	Lee and Carter come out of the sewer.

				LEE
		Red Dragon.

				CARTER
		That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

	Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the
	hotel -- it's like a HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE.  The richest of the
	rich are making their way inside.

				LEE
		Let's go.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  We can't go in like
		this.  Look at this place, we gotta look
		fly.  We gotta Mac out.

				LEE
		What is Mac out?

				CARTER
		Follow me my Asian brother.

	Carter and Lee start to walk away.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Just stay down wind, because I think you
		stepped in some serious rat shit down
		there.

	EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store.

	INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them.

		May I help you gentlemen?

	Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of
	superbills.

				CARTER
		Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this
		body but pure silk.  And get my partner
		something from the children's
		department.

	Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				SALESMAN
		Would your partner like silk as well?  I
		personally like it when a couple
		matches.

	Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's
		no couple here.  Just two single police
		officers working a very dangerous case.

				LEE
		Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing
		us.

				SALESMAN
		I'm sure all the boys are chasing you
		two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys
		the bell of the ball.

	He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee.

				CARTER
		This is the last time I go shopping with
		you.

	EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly
	tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. 
	Le is awkward in "player" guise.

				CARTER
			(whispering)
		Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You
		own the place.

	Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as
	they walk through the doors.

				LEE
		I own the place.

	INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to
	imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT
	BUDDHA --

				CARTER
		That looks exactly like my Uncle
		Darrell.

				LEE
		Buddha is the symbol of luck and good
		fortune.

				CARTER
		Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. 
		The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

	They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA
	COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle.

	RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The
	MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around
	the perimeter - a sign reads:

				SIGN
		$50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER!

	The LIGHTS DIM - a spotlight comes on and finds STEVEN REIGN
	on the balcony overlooking the ENTRANCE.

				STEVEN REIGN
		A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
		village in China hired a young Dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  Their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  The Dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
			(beat)
		Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that
		lost treasure.  It is here, inside the
		greatest casino in the world!  Welcome
		to the Red Dragon, where everybody is a
		winner!

	Reign smiles, flips a switch -- the CASINO COMES TO LIFE. 
	Fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
	waiting.

	A BAND PLAYS on a stage in the casino lounge.

	Chinese ACROBATS perform suspended from the ceiling and on
	the balconies above.

	Applause all around as the FLAME shoots out of the dragon's
	nostrils and the acrobats perform.  Carter and Lee walk down
	the red carpet.

				CARTER
			(to waitress)
		Bring us some twelve-year old scotch...
			(to a cigarette girl)
		Get us a box of your finest cigars.
			(to a change girl)
		Give me ten dollars in nickels.
						
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON

	Dice ROLLING on a craps table.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Seven!

	We see BLACKJACK DEALERS BUSTING - paying out CUSTOMERS.

	Hundred dollar slot machines paying out jackpots.

	GAMBLERS winning all over the casino.  Then going to the main
	cage and exchanging their chips for SUPERBILLS.

				CARTER
		Look at this place, Lee.  The biggest
		front in the world.

	As people pour into the casino, Steven Reign is making his
	way through the crowd, shaking hands and posing for pictures.

				LEE
		Carter...here comes the rich white man.

				CARTER
		Wait here.  I'll handle this.

	As Carter walks off, a WOMAN grabs Lee and pulls him onto the
	dance floor.

	INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

	The woman spins to face Lee, her face half-hidden under the
	dance floor lights.

				ISABELLA
		Put your arms around me.

				LEE
		Excuse me?

	Isabella grabs him around the waist, pulls him close.

				ISABELLA
		Hold me close.  There's cameras
		everywhere.

	An ASIAN BAND sings STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT as Lee tries his
	best to slow dance.  An intimate moment between Isabella and
	Lee, her face nestled in the crook of his neck, hiding her
	face.

				LEE
		What's going on?

				ISABELLA
		I need your help.

				LEE
		Last time you needed my help I ended up
		in the back of a truck.

				ISABELLA
		I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You
		have to trust me.

	Lee starts to get into the music, moving his hips in a slow,
	sensual rhythm.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		You move well.

				LEE
		Just trying to make it look real.

				ISABELLA
		Look over there.  That's the eye in the
		sky room.

	Lee looks over her shoulder. 

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Behind me is the soft count room.  We're
		pretty sure the plates are back there.

				LEE
		Why don't you go get them?

				ISABELLA
		If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

				
	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter
	steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug.

				CARTER
		Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody
		get a picture, we can use it for a mug
		shot.

				STEVEN REIGN
		Detective Carter, you always seem to
		show up where you don't belong.

				CARTER
		Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I
		want the truth.  Is there any way I can
		date your daughter?  Just dinner and a
		movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...

				STEVEN REIGN
		Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I
		crawled out from under the first rock. 
		Do you really think you can intimidate
		me here?

				CARTER
		You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most
		counterfeiters only get ten cents on the
		dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure
		genius.

				STEVEN REIGN
		You play games with me, Detective, and
		you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. 
		The odds are always in favor of the
		house.

	Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave.

	INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

	Lee is dancing close with Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		The Secret Service almost busted Reign
		at his casino in Macao, but the place
		burned down before we could move in.

				LEE
		How do I know I can trust you?

				ISABELLA
		Dip me!

	Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'm asking for real now -- will you help
		the Secret Service?

				LEE
		No.
			(beat)
		But I'll help you.

	Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. 
	He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
	Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor.

				CARTER
		Lee, what the hell are you doing?

				LEE
		Dancing?

				CARTER
		Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong
		arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the
		line, and you're up here dancing with
		some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?

				LEE
		It was Isabella.  She says the plates
		are in the soft count room.

	Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD
	standing in front of a small door.

				CARTER
		Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She
		almost got us killed.  She's setting you
		up again!

				LEE
		No.  I'm going to find out.

				CARTER
		Wait a second.  There's guards all over
		the place.  You'll need a distraction.

	Carter looks around the casino.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'll go to the craps table, make a big
		scene.  When security comes over, you
		make your move.  

				LEE
		Try to keep them busy for five minutes.

				CARTER
		I'll give it my best shot.
						
			INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Sir, you're aware that we require a
		fifty-thousand dollar buy in to gamble
		here this weekend?

	Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the
	table.

				CARTER
		I saw the sign, I can read.  Now gimme a
		hundred-thousand in chips.  And a Diet
		Coke and some wash-n-dries.  Let's move,
		people, I came to play.

	The DEALER pushes 100K worth of CHIPS in front of Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		What the hell is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Those are five hundred dollar chips.

				CARTER
		Did you give me five-hundred dollar
		chips because I'm black?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, I just assumed...

				CARTER
		You assumed a brother coming in here can
		only afford five-hundred dollars a roll,
		is that right?  Are you a racist?

				CRAPS DEALER
		No, sir.

				CARTER
			(starting to scream)
		Everyone else at the table has thousand
		dollar chips, but the black man gets the
		nickel, is that it?  Did my people
		survive two-hundred years of slavery so
		you could send us back to the cotton
		fields with five-hundred dollar chips? 
		Do I look like Chicken George to you?

	The PIT BOSS gets on his walkie-talkie.

				PIT BOSS
		Floor security, we have a problem at
		table nine.

	EXT. SOFT COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

	The SECURITY GUARD lowers his walkie-talkie, starts moving
	towards Carter's table.

	INT. CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

	TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.

				CARTER
		Answer me one question.  How come Ben
		Vereen isn't performing here at the
		hotel?  Is Ben Vereen not good enough
		for you people?

				PIT BOSS
		Lionel Ritchie is performing here
		tonight.

				CARTER
		Lionel Ritchie hasn't been black since
		the Commodores.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, you're going to have to calm down.

	Carter watches as Lee moves past the guard and makes his way
	into the soft count room.

				CARTER
		I have a dream, where black people and
		white people can gamble together without
		getting different chips!

	A BIG CROWD has gathered as the Security Guards try and push
	their way through.  The pit boss picks up the phone, calls
	upstairs.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Sing with me!  "We shall overcome!"

	Carter starts clapping, and the confused crowd joins in as
	the Security Guards move in.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you.  Now in the spirit of
		brotherhood, let's play craps!

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
	walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

	He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through
	the casino door.  He has no choice but to crawl over the back
	of a money cart and hug the top.  He lies as still as he can,
	trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
	directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the
	ceiling.

	WE SEE LEE'S FACE

	as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
	words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

	Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain
	of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out. 
	On the opposite side, the REAL MONEY is being WHEELED OUT
	toward a waiting TRUCK that is parked at the back door.

	Lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
	blown.  He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
	the locked vault.  There's no way to get the plates. 
	Isabella has set him up again.

	He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.

				LEE
		Hi.  How's it going?  You guys have
		change for a twenty?

	The GUARDS make their move.  And Lee starts to fight them
	down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
	MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
	the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
	right cross.

	Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
	stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.  She holds a knife
	to Lee's throat.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		Open your mouth.

	She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
	She holds the detonator in her hand.

				HU LI (CONT'D)
			(continuing in Chinese)
		That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector. 
		Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
		into your brain.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
	rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner six!

				CARTER
		How much is that?

				CRAPS DEALER
		Two-hundred thousand!

				CARTER
		Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants
		a hundred dollars?

	Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
	AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Here, your highness, have a hundred
		dollars.  The Viagra is on me tonight!

				GAMBLER
			(South African accent)
		I am not royalty, sir.

				CARTER
		Don't say that, we're all royalty.  My
		great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
		we probably cousins, man.  How much you
		got on the table?

				GAMBLER
		One million.

				CARTER
		Yeah, we definitely cousins now.  Who
		wants to blow on my hand for luck?

	Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
	YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
		blows on my hand for luck?

				TEXAN
			(embarrassed)
		She's not my lady.  She's my niece.

				CARTER
		Can I come over for Thanksgiving?  Come
		on, baby, give me some luck.

	The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Nice blowing.  When's your next
		birthday, I'll be the cake.

				TEXAN
		Hey, buddy, watch yourself.

				CARTER
		Don't threaten me.  I got friends in
		this town that will bite off your ears. 
		Just sit tight, because I've got the
		dice and I am on fire!

	Carter throws the dice.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner, seven!

	The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.

				CARTER
		Let it ride!
						
			INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
	sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads.  As they walk into
	the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel.  A MAN
	stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
	casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.

	Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
	his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Imagine a business where people hand you
		money.  And you hand them back
		absolutely nothing.

	Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee. 
	Isabella is standing next to him.  Lee is shocked at the
	sight of Ricky Tan alive.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Now that's a true American dream. 
		Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
		very greed driven US Customs agent.

	Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Look at you, you're ridiculous.  You
		know it didn't have to be like this. 
		But it's too bad!  Like father, like
		son.

	Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT.  Hu Li motions to one of
	the monitors.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		He's going for the plates.

	Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
	walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
	SUITE.

				RICKY TAN
		Look at this old fool, what does he
		think he's doing?

	Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		It's almost impossible to find a partner
		that's trustworthy and loyal.  Wouldn't
		you agree, Lee?

	ON ANOTHER SCREEN

	We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life. 
	Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
	Isabella as he goes.

				RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
		Well, at least you will die with honor. 
		But choy Gien.

	SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
	surrounding him.

				CRAPS DEALER
		Winner!  Four, winner!

				CARTER
		I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. 
		That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those
		here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me
		out!

	Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
	Carter's table.

				PIT BOSS
		Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
		cashier.

				CARTER
		That would be great.  Don't want any of
		these rich white people to jump me.

	As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
	glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT

	Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.

				RICKY TAN
		Chai Hu Li.
			("Little Fox")
		Have fun.

	Ricky Tan walks out.  Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
	plays with the button.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
		this button.

	Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee.  She holds the
	blade to his face.  About to cut him.  When Isabella pulls
	her gun.

	Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
	his back.  Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
	knife in the other.  She takes a step toward Isabella.

				ISABELLA
		It's time to end this, Inspector.

	Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
	from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
	sticking the gun under her chin.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		Don't move!  United States Secret
		Service.

	Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
	hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
	the TWO WOMEN fight around it.

	Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
	rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when:

	THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR

	They're about to move in.

				HU LI
		Get the detonator!

	The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
	KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.

	One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
	gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his
	back.

	Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.

	Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CASHIER

	Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:

	CRASH!

	An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. 
	In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.

	The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:

				CARTER
		Lee!!

	The guards restrain him.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Lemme ask you something.  Any of you
		ever felt $500,000 before?

	He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
	as the GUARDS hit the floor.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Doesn't feel so good, does it?

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it
	from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES
	OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
	DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before
	Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
	detonator on her rounds.

	Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a
	BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it,
	but he does see:

	ACROSS THE CASINO

	Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
	bay with a croupier stick.

				CARTER
		Black man gets on a hot streak and
		you're all trippin'?

	Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same
	simultaneous though:

				CARTER (CONT'D)
			(help!)
		Lee!

				LEE
			(help!)
		MMMMMM!!!!

	Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
	But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way
	is the HIGH WAY.

	Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. 
	Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. 
	He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
	landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
	side.

	Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
	the Sky Room.  He grins.

				CARTER
		Check it out.  Catfight!

	POW!  He socks a GUARD in the face.

	INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle.  Rolling to the
	floor, they both see the gun.  They scramble over each other
	to get to it first.

	INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS

	A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
	arrives.  He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
	plea MUFFLED.

				CARTER
		What the HELL are you doing with tape on
		your face?

	No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive.  Kicks
	and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!  He bobs
	and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
	between swings.  Suddenly:

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.

	Everyone HITS THE DECK.  Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
	as panic ripples through the Casino.  People FLEE for the
	EXITS.

	THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY.  It gets knocked over and TIPS
	on the floor.  The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		This can't be good.

	Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it!  A
	high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.  He LUNGES for
	it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --

	WHAM!  He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY.  The second it hits
	the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.

	ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room.  Hu Li
	STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.  

	The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li.  As she bends to PICK
	up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time. 
	Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.

	Hu Li lifts the detonator.

	Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.

	Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.

				LEE
			(diving on Carter)
		Bomb!!!

	Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.

	KABOOM!

	The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION.  Chips and cash
	volcano.  Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast. 
	SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.

	AS THE SMOKE CLEARS

	Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines. 
	The place is deserted.

				CARTER
		Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
		your mouth?

				LEE
		I did!

				CARTER
		No you didn't!

				LEE
		Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

	A hand on Carter's arm.  THIS IS SERIOUS.
			
						LEE (CONT'D)
		Ricky Tan is alive.

				CARTER
		What?!?!

				LEE
		We have to get to the Penthouse.

	Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
	of the casino.

				CARTER
		Hold on!

	Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee. 
	But halfway up the carpet.  Carter stops.  Lee turns to see
	what is holding him up.  

	Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		You go after Ricky.  I got this.

				LEE
		Carter...

				CARTER
		Just GO!

	Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE
	TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
	short work of them, and races toward the elevators.

	DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!

	Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her
	long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches,
	flexes, ready to sting like a bee.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I'm not gonna hold you back this time
		just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna
		pretend you're a man.

	She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
	undershirt.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		A very beautiful man with a perfect body
		who I'd like to take to the movies.

	She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
	like a master.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I may have been absent the day we went
		over this in karate class.

	Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
	soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for
	another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him.

	INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT

	Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND
	cuts through, parting the doors.

	It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder.

				LEE
		Are you okay?

				ISABELLA
		I'm fine.

	She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and
	holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down.

				LEE
		I didn't know which side you were on.

				ISABELLA
		Now you know.

	DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
	- the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and
	steps into the elevator.

				ISABELLA (CONT'D)
		I'll try to get backup.  Be careful.

	The elevator doors close.
			
	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of
	HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
	black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he
	comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.

				RICKY TAN
		American's love to gamble.  Don't they,
		Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm
		leaving.

				RICKY TAN
		And my plates?

				STEVEN REIGN
		They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't
		have a problem with that.

	Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and
	starts to walk toward the door.

				RICKY TAN
		I enjoyed that little story you told
		about the Dragon and the treasure.  My
		mother used to tell it to me all the
		time.  Do you know the moral of that
		story, Mr. Reign?

				STEVEN REIGN
		Greed will imprison us all.

	Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.

				RICKY TAN
		I hate that fortune cookie shit.

	Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
	dead to the floor.  Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.

	Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.

	INT. CASINO - NIGHT

	WHOOSH!  Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
	Carter's hands.

				CARTER
		Will you STOP?!?!
			(picks up cocktail umbrella)
		What am I supposed to fight you with?

	No more toying.  Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
	WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD.  She SLICES it in HALF!  He's
	got nowhere to hide.

	She JABS him with the sword.  Carter SCREAMS.  Falls back
	against the table, clutching his chest.  Hu Li WINDMILLS,
	kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --

	THWACK!

	The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
	she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade.  Staring
	at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

	Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
	HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		When are you people gonna learn?  Don't
		mess with the brothas!

	WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
	reaches through the slice in his jacket.  Instead of a hand
	covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Benjamin!

	Carter runs for the elevator.
						
				INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
	body.

				RICKY TAN
		You're just like your father, Lee.  All
		these years hiding behind his badge.  I
		wanted to help him, to share with him,
		but he was too afraid of change.  When
		you think about it, I didn't really kill
		him.  I just put him out of his misery.

				LEE
		Put the plates down.  It's over.

				RICKY TAN
		I don't think it's over.  There are
		casinos all over this country.  Let me
		make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make
		the same mistake he did.

	Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.

				LEE
		If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
		kill you.

				RICKY TAN
		Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

	Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
	taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
	Carter bursts in the room.

				CARTER
		Hey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's
		up, Lee?

	Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him
	like this before.

				RICKY TAN
		Would you like me to tell you how your
		father died?

				CARTER
		Lee, you okay?

	Lee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.

				RICKY TAN
		He never begged for his life.  Or tried
		to make a deal.  All that he asked me,
		just seconds before I pulled the
		trigger, was that I promise not to kill
		you.

	Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
	trigger but can't.

				CARTER
		Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,
		man.  He's making you do this.

				LEE
		It's worth it to me.

				RICKY TAN
		Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you
		gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
		like your father?

				CARTER
		C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You
		won, now just put the gun down.

	Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.

				RICKY TAN
		That's what I thought.

	Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
	plates hit him across the face and knock him down.

	THE GUN IS LOOSE

	Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:

	Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM
	SQUARE IN THE CHEST.

	Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to
	grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.

	But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	A TAXI is parked out front.  Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof. 
	SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
	WINNER!"

	INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
	it's finally over.  Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.

				CARTER
		I don't know about you, but I need a
		wine cooler.

	As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
	bleeding and half-dead.  She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. 
	This one twice the size of the one from earlier.

				HU LI
			(in Chinese)
		We'll go together, Inspector.

				CARTER
		Please tell me she just asked for a ride
		to the airport.

	Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn
	and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.

	EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

	Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
	PENTHOUSE BLOWS!

	The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
	of the hotel.

	THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.

	Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER. 
	They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
	SIGN.

	It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.

	Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.  A HUGE
	TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. 
	The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.

				LEE
		I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit!!

	They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips
	and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
	STRETCH LIMO.
						
	INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

	Lee and Carter land in the back.  Slam into their seats and
	try to catch their breath.  The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
	when they realize they're alive!

				CARTER
		We made it, man.

				LEE
		No problem.

	Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
	OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
	them.  The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
	night on the town.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		Well, there is a God after all.

	Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
	the hotel.

				LIMO DRIVER
		Here we are.  The Red Dragon hotel.

	In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
	CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.

				VERSACE SALESMAN
		We're all going gambling and then to see
		Siegried and Roy.  I hope you two are
		feeling lucky!

	INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

	Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
	Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  Lee and
	Isabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,
	Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.

				CARTER
		I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? 
		You played it cool, though.  Walking
		away, never looking back.

				LEE
		She's going home to New York.  I need
		some ice.

	Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.

				CARTER
		That your gate down there?

				LEE
		Yes.

				CARTER
		I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.

				LEE
		I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.

				CARTER
		You take care of yourself, Lee.

	Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE.  Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
	like a brother.  The two men smile.  Turn to walk away.

				LEE
		Carter, wait.  There's something I want
		you to have.

	Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket.  Hands it to Carter.

				CARTER
		Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I
		can't take this.

				LEE
		It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

	Carter takes the badge.  Smiles.

				CARTER
		In that case, I got something for you. 
		I picked it up at the hotel.

	Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

				LEE
		What is this?

				CARTER
		About fifty grand.  I won it at the
		tables.

				LEE
		No, Carter.  I can't take this.

				CARTER
		It's okay, I got lots more.

	Carter pulls out another wad of cash.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		They owe us, man.  That's the least they
		can do.

				LEE
		This money is evidence.

				CARTER
		Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five
		minutes and live it up.  There must be
		something you want.

	Lee looks back toward Isabella.

				LEE
		I always wanted to go to Madison Square
		Garden.  See the Knicks play.

				CARTER
		New York City?

				LEE
		First class.

				CARTER
		The Plaza Hotel?

				LEE
		A little Mu-shu.

				CARTER
		Some Kung-Pao?

	They look at each other, smile.

				CARTER (CONT'D)
		I could use a little vacation.

				LEE
		Amen to that, brother.

	As Lee and Carter start to walk away together, the MUSIC
	SWELLS.  "WAR" starts to PLAY.  They dance their way through
	a crowd of people, their arms raised as the two friends make
	their way through the airport.

          Of the 9 best (11-year-old) buddies that ever lived. On a
          makeshift baseball diamond - a sandlot... circa 1962:
                         
          SCOTTY SMALLS, studious-looking; ALAN "YEAH-YEAH" McCLENNAN,

          horn rims; JEFF "SQUINTS" PALLEDOROUS, a transistor radio
          plug wedged in his ear; and BENNY RODRIGUEZ, leaning on
          Scotty's shoulder, sporting the world's all-time hottest
          sneakers... P.F. Flyers.
                         
          One palm up, together like the 9 musketeers they're holding
          forward a baseball... with a mysterious smudge.

           Everyone's got that one summer when
           they were a kid... a summer so perfect,
           that it stays with them forever. It
           stays caught in time, like Camelot.
           pause That summer is like a book with
           a million blank pages that you get to
           fill with the greatest story you could
           ever dream up.
                          (BEAT)
           This is a story about a legend. And
           for us, that summer was the one when
           the legend got made.
                         
          WE CLOSE IN TIGHT on the black smudge, which becomes:

           They're not exactly a dime a dozen,

           anyone has ever met a certified Legend,

          a row of houses, whose backyards are all chain link fenced.
          The fencing is trimmed individually in wood, bamboo etc...
          One has the world's coolest treehouse. Next to it... is the

          The guys round up in the infield. As they play catch, they
          spread farther and farther apart... until they've each taken
          up the position they most like to play. They fit the paltry

           When I moved in that summer, I'd never
           played baseball, but it wasn't too
           tough figuring out who these guys'
           heroes were. So, after a week of
           watching... I figured baseball seemed
           like the best way to get in with them.

          in bed, oiling his glove, staring out his window at Scotty's
          house. Taped to his footboard is the most important picture

          bothered and unhappy. This stuff is too damn easy for him.
          He whips on a last bolt and connects the itty-bitty motor.

          a tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble. Drops it on
          a roller coaster track. The marble whips around corners and

                          (BEAT)
           Scotty, look at me. I know you're
           smart, and I'm proud of you. But you
           have to get outside, you have to...
           play.
                         
          She sits across from him, trying to get through.

                          MOM (CONT'D)
           I want you to get out in the fresh air
           and make friends. Run around and scrape
           your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees
           and hop fences. Get in trouble for
           crying out loud.
                          (BEAT)
           Not too much, but some. You have my
           permission. Now how many mothers do
           you think say that to their sons?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           None mothers I guess.
                         
                          MOM
           I want you to make friends this summer,
           Scotty. Lots of them.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           I know, but I don't - I'm no good at
           anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an
                          EGGHEAD -
                         
                          MOM
           - and you'll always be just an egghead
           with an attitude like that. So promise
           me, alright?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           'Kay.
                         
                          MOM
           Maybe tomorrow you'll make some friends.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah, maybe tomorrow.

           Mom? Do you think Bill - I mean Dad -
           will teach me to play catch?
                         
                          MOM
           Are you kidding, he'd love it, you
           know what an athlete he wasIn high
           school.
                          (ALTERMNATE LINE)
           You know what a pitcher he was in high
           college.
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Scotty slurps a glass of chocolate Quick. Rinses the glass
          too carefully. Gathers courage for something. Breathes deep -
          starts across the house.
                          11
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Scotty peeks through a slightly open door. BILL moves around
          inside, unpacking boxes. Scotty reaches to knock. Stops.
          Almost walks away. Then musters the gumption. KNOCKS.
                         
           BILL (O.S.)
           Yeah...
                         
          Scotty takes a few cautious steps into...
                         
          INT. BILL'S DEN - NIGHT
                         
          ...a trophy room. Ribbons, plaques, trophies. Bill must've
          been some athlete; but he limps now. Scotty lingers...
          gathering more courage.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           My real dad died when I was just a
           little kid. My mom married Bill a
           year before we moved to the
           neighborhood.
                          (BEAT)
           At the time, he and I were still getting
           used to each other.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember
           you promised you'd teach me to play
           catch?
                         
                          BILL
           Um hum...
                         
          He dusts a batting trophy.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Well, could you teach me?
                         
                          BILL
           Sure.
                         
          He places a pitching plaque. Scotty waits awkwardly. Waits
          for more words. They don't come.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Okay. Great. Thanks.
                         
                          BILL
           Um hum.
                         
          Scotty leaves, bringing the door with him on his way out.
          Through the cracked portal he sees Bill set a silver pedestal
          on the main shelf. On this he sets a baseball...
                         
                          
                          12
                         
                         
                          
                         
          just a baseball.
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
                         
          Scotty wakes up. Checks his (Theme) clock. 8:30. He bolts
          out of bed. Dashes through the house to the front door.
          Throws it open and runs down to...
                         
          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Ham, at the HELMS BAKERY TRUCK, buying a donut, then scrambling
          around the far corner.
                         
                          HAM

                         CLOSET
                         
          finding a vinyl, "toy" baseball glove. It's still in the
          package, with a note attached: "To Scotty Boy - Love, Grandma!"
          It's all he's got. He shovels through a pair of Mickey Mouse
          ears - a cowboy hat - finds the closest thing he's got to a
          baseball cap... a long, duck-billed fishing cap with a big
          embroidered trout.
                         
          EXT. ENROUTE TO THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          Scotty runs by (soon familiar places):
                         
                         A 5 & DIME
                         
          A BOYS CLUB
                         
          A LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD,
                         
          where he slows momentarily, envious of the crisply uniformed
          kids... wow. Moving on down
                         
          EXT. THE BLOCK OF SANDLOT COMMON HOUSES - DAY
                         
          whose backyards we already know. Scotty flat out stops at

                         THE HOUSE
                         
          with the fiberglass panels out back. Scary place.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          Scotty slips quietly through the secret fence doorway, emerging
                         IN
                         
          DEEP LEFT FIELD
                         
          where he hugs the perimeter, moving slowly toward the sandlot
          common houses. Winded, Scotty finds
                         
                         THE GANG'S

                          NARRATOR
           They never kept score. They never
           chose sides. They never even really
           stopped playing the game... it just
           went on forever. Everyday they picked
           up right where they left off the day
           before. It was an endless "dream game."
                          (BEAT)
           There was only 8 of them, so they didn't
           have a whole team. It didn't matter
           though... Benny was so good he took
           everyone's position when it was there
           ups.
                          (BEAT)
           I didn't know any of that then... I 
           just knew they were having the time of
           their lives and I wanted to be a part
           of it.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          watches and listens (as he goes) to the SHARP, satisfying
          sound of the hardball, SNAPPING CLEANLY in the oily leather
          of their gloves.
                         
          HE LOOKS AT
                         
          his own toy glove... how embarrassing.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          continues around the perimeter, trying to be seen and become
          invisible. He goes unwittingly CLOSER TO those green
          fiberglass panels.

                         BENNY

          come too close to the green fence. Something has overcome
          him... fear! He stares with serious woollies at
                         
          A HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS
                         
          and sees only dust rising in time with some great, SOUNDS OF
          EXHALATION. And then, before he can draw any conclusions...
          disaster.

          THE FLY BALL
                         
          coming right at him.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          tracks it, frozen stiff. Scared shitless. At the past
          possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and ducks...
          social suicide.
                         
                         THE BALL
                         
          beans him at the glove covering his noggin.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          hits his butt. The ball rolls a bit. Comes to an "I-dare-
          you" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of
          that preternatural fence. Scotty pulls his arms away from
          his face.
                         
                         THE GANG

                         SCOTTY
                         
          moves for the ball. As he goes, he sweats:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           'Kay, I'll get it!

           Don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus -
           don't be a goofus.
                         
          He reaches the fence and the ball and stops. It's hard to
          move. The force emanating from the backyard has got him:
                         
          DUST THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS
                         
          keeps perfect time with the monster-breathing.
                         
          AN OLENADER BUSH
                         
          moves. It scares the living kapok out of
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          who snatches up the ball and back-pedals 10 feet.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           WE'RE WAITING...
                         
          He throws back the ball. And his chances of getting in with
          these guys are over. Because Scotty... throws like a girl!
                         
                         THE BALL
                         
          droops forward in the air. Lands 6 feet from him. Rolls
          slowly up to the gang, finally coming to a dainty stop at
          DeNunez' feet.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          looks from the ball to Scotty... they CRACK UP!

                         SCOTTY
                         
          walks away... crying.
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           My life is over.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          is the only one that isn't laughing. He stares the others
          down.
                         
                          DENUNEZ
           Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see
           that throw?
                         
          He imitates it, "flipping" his glove to Ham. The gang BUSTS
          UP again.
                         
                          HAM
                          (TRULY STUNNED)
           That kid's got the gaw'damn panty-
           waistiest arm I ever saw in my whole
           life.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           I seen a guy once that threw like that.
           I mean not that bad, but at least so
           bad that he hadda move in the fourth
           grade 'cause they nicknamed him
           "Bloomers."
                         
          Benny's look stifles the bunch.
                         
                          BENNY
           I bet not one of you knows how The
           Babe got his nickname.
                         
                          HAM
           Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like
           a little kid face.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids
           and stuff.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe,
           because he was like the child of Yankee
           Stadium.

                          BENNY
           I knew it. You're all full of crap.
           George Herman Ruth got his nickname
           because his mom died when he was just
           a little kid, and he hadda go live in
           an orphanage.
                         
          Silence. None of the other guys has heard this before.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Nobody liked him there. The bigger
           guys picked on him all the time. And
           when they messed with him he couldn't
           fight back, 'cause he was just... like
           scared. So when they messed with him,
           he cried about it.
                          (BEAT)
           He cried... so they called him The
           Babe.
                         
          This hits home real good.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           How ya think that kid just felt?
                         
          Benny exits the sandlot, leaving the others with a lesson
          learned.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           Everyone knew Benny was different.
           Nobody ever voted or anything, but he
           was the leader.

          As Benny goes into his house, the other's round the corner
          far behind him.
                         
                         THE MOON
                         
          is up. Full. Like a big baseball.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           Even though he seemed like a regular
           guy, he wasn't. Benny was special,
           and he was loyal.

           When they'd all tried out for youth
           league, they'd all made it. But when
           they found out they'd have to play on
           different teams, Benny told 'em that
           if they couldn't play together, they
           shouldn't play at all. So, they stayed
           together.

          Scotty's house.

           So, the only person that ever felt
           sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie
           was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.

           Even though neither of us knew it at
           the time, we were connected. Like I
           had been born for just that one moment,
           when I would perform the world's all-
           time boner, and Benny would bail me
           out.
                          (BEAT)
           Connected as friends... born to meet
           for just that one moment.
                         
          We DRIFT OFF Benny to his PICTURE OF MAURY WILLS in a pickle.

          at the table. Bill sifting through mounds of paperwork. Scotty
          eating breakfast. Scotty's spoon CLANGS one too many times.
          Bill looks up at him.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Sorry...

          INT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY

                          SCOTTY
           He's too busy, Mom.

          Scotty comes back in. Stops mutely near Bill. Long, agonizing
          seconds pass. Finally:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Um, Da -
                         
          Quick look toward the kitchen, then:
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           (so Mom won't hear)
           - I mean, Bill. Could we... I mean
           could you, like you said - teach me to
           catch today?
                         
                          BILL
           Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta
           get this done.
                         
          It ain't much, but it's something.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Okay, thanks.
                         
          Mom comes in behind Scotty.
                         
                          MOM
           Bill, can't you take a break and teach
           him now?
                         
                          SCOTTY

           Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm
           just under the gun here, ya know?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Mom, really -
                         
                          MOM
           - How long could it take? You can't
           spare a half hour to show him?
                         
          Bill drops his pen. Checks his watch. A lost battle here.
                         
                          BILL
                          (ANNOYED)
           Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove.
           Come on.

          Bill exits past them. Scotty's been "Mom-embarrassed." She
          looks at him:
                         
                          MOM
                          (CLUELESS)
           There. See. Told you so.
                         
          Scotty shuffles out back, shaking his head.

          Bill slides his hand into his glove. He warms up the cradle,
          POPPING the "hardball" into the palm.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          stands ready to "learn" on the other side of the yard.
          Appropriately pitiful in "trout" cap and toy glove.
                         
                         BACKYARD
                         
                          BILL
           Keep your eye on the ball. Put the
           glove up where it goes. Okay?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah, okay, I think so.
                         
          Bill throws one to Scotty. The toy glove goes up to the right.
          The ball sails by to the left.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Darn. Sorry.
                         
          Bill's a little amazed at that one. He checks his watch.
                         
                          BILL
           That's alright, just throw it back.
                         
          Scotty eagerly retrieves it. Turns to throw - deja vu - he
          runs over, hands Bill the ball.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Here.
                         
          He runs back across the yard. Turns 'round again. Holds his
          glove up stiffly.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Okay. I'm ready.
                         
          Bill cannot believe this. Checks his watch again.

                          BILL
           Keep your eye on the ball. Put the
           glove up where the ball goes.
                         
          He throws again. The ball bounces off the toy glove - breaks
          the webbing.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Darn. My glove got -
                         
                          BILL
           - not bad. Right side at least. Now,
           just throw it back this time.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           But my glove -
                         
          Bill's looking at his watch again. Scotty fetches the ball -
          gulps - "flips" it back.
                         
                          BILL
                          (DISBELIEF)
           Oh, my God.
                         
          EXT. THE BLOCK - SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Benny comes out of his house. From the sidewalk
                         
                         BENNY'S POV
                         
          up the side of Scotty's house into the backyard. He can see
          Scotty. Only Scotty. Standing there game as hell, trying to
          catch balls that seem to be coming too fast. The ball comes.
          Scotty ducks. The ball hits the block wall behind him,
          caroming back toward where we assume Bill is throwing from.
                         
                         BENNY'S

          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
                         
          Scotty's still game. Bill's at ropes end. Check his watch
          again.
                         
                          BILL
           Alright, Scott, listen, this one's
           gonna come right at you, easy, okay?
                         
                          SCOTTY

                          BILL
           Just keep your eye on the ball and put
           your glove up. You'll catch it.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Okay.
                         
                         BILL
                         
          throws.
                         
                         THE BALL
                         
          comes slowly forward.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          sticks his glove up.
                         
                         SCOTTY'S EYES
                         
          widen.
                         
                         THE BALL
                         
          hits dead center glove. Rips the "toy" webbing. Flies through
                         AND CLOUTS
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          right in the eye.

          INT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Scotty's mom comes unglued.
                         
                          MOM
           Bill! What happened?!
                         
                          BILL
           Well, he -
                         
                          
                          23
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (PRIDE'S SAKE)
           - just took my eye off the ball, Mom.
                         
          Scotty's mom pulls his hand away from his eye. Great shiner.
          Bill grabs a steak from the fridge, FLOPS it over Scotty's
          eye.
                         
                          BILL
           There. Keep that on for an hour.
           It'll still be black, but it won't
           swell.
                          (BEAT)
           Sorry. We'll try again soon.
                         
          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Scotty emerges. Sits on the porch. Pitiful and forlorn.
          Chin in his hands, he looks across the street. He starts.
          His hand moves to cover his black eye... but he thinks the
          better of it.
                         
                         BENNY'S
                         
          on the curb across the street. A moment goes by. Benny raises
          a hand.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          slowly waves back.
                         
                         BOTH
                         
          Benny comes over to Scotty's sidewalk.
                         
                          BENNY
           Gonna go play some ball. Need a extra
           guy. Wanna go?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Naw. Thanks.
                         
                          BENNY
           Why not? Doncha like baseball?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Oh. Yeah. But, ah...
                         
                          BENNY
           But what?
                         
          Scotty searches for a quick way out of this. Gets it:
                         
                         
                         
                          
                          24
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          SCOTTY
           But my glove's busted. So, ya know, I
           can't go. Thanks, though.
                         
          Benny reaches behind his back. Takes something out of his
          jeans - like he's going for a gun. Smiles a little.
                         
                          BENNY
           That's okay.
                         
          He offers it to Scotty... a "real" glove.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           I got a extra one.
                         
          Scotty SHOUTS over his shoulder:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Mom! I'm gonna go play some ball!
                         
          As they move away down the block.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Thanks. Cool glove.
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah. Cool shiner. We gotta stop by
           the 5 & 10 first. Need a new ball.
           And chaw and stuff, ya know?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah.
                         
                          BENNY
           You dip chaw?

          Benny & Scotty go inside.
                         
          INT. FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          Benny grabs a new baseball on the stride, and handful of
          bazooka from a jar on the soda fountain counter. He leaves
          the money and exits. Scotty follows.

          EXT. REAR OF FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          Benny and Scotty come upon the gang (all their mouths are
          full a' bazooka) as Ham's chompin' on a candy cigar doing a
                         BABE IMITATION:

           Great Bambino!
                         
          The gang laughs.

           Who's that?
                         
          The gang stifles. They're none-to-pleased. Ham sees why.
          The new kid... "flipper." Eight pairs of eyes burn holes in
          his little soul.

           He's Scott Smalls.

           Hi.
                         
          The gang just stares.
                         
                          BENNY
           He's gonna play with us. He makes

          The pack follows Benny onto the diamond. Scotty trails after
          them.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Why'd you bring him for, Benny?
                         
                          BENNY
           'Cause there's eight of us, and he
           makes nine.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn't
           bring her!
                         
                          BENNY
           With nine Guys we got a whole team.
                         
                          
                          27
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          HAM
           No, with Elswenger we had a whole team,
           and Elswenger could throw!
                         
                          DENUNEZ
           He ain't game, Benny. He can't throw
           for nothin'.
                         
          Scotty drifts off by himself. He can hear what's exchanged.
                         
                          TIMMY
           Benny, you already play all the empty
           positions since Elswenger moved to
           Arizona.
                         
                          BENNY
           And now I get to rotate 8 positions
           instead of 7. I need the practice.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           No you don't. It's stupid, Benny.
           The kid's an L-7 weenie.
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
           Yeah-yeah, Oscar Mayer even.
                         
                          BENNY
           Oh yeah, Squints, and you're Willie
           freakin' Mays. You catch like a dork -
           anybody ever bust your chops about
           that?
                         
                          SQUINTS
                          (PALTRY EXCUSE)
           No, but I'm - ya know, I'm -
                         
                          BENNY
           - and you run like a duck, Yeah- Yeah.
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
                          (IT'S TRUE)
           'Kay-'kay... But I'm -
                         
                          BENNY
           - part-a the game.
                         
                          SQUINTS
                          (DEFENSIVE)
           Right.
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
           Yeah-yeah.
                         
                         
                         
                          
                          28
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          BENNY
           How come he don't get to be?
                         
          Nobody's got an answer for that one. Base up you blockheads.)
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          hits the field. Their suspicious glares aren't lost on
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          standing off by himself, kinda lost. Benny comes over.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           You take right field, Smalls.
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (EAGER)
           Right. Okay. Ah... where exactly is
           that?
                         
                          BENNY
                          (SURPRISED)
           Uh, over there.
                         
          Scotty runs "over there" anxiously.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          takes home plate worried: "Maybe the kid is a weenie."
                         
                         INFIELD
                         
          DeNunez at the mound. Benny's up.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Get two.
                         
          Repeat at 3rd, stabs it effortlessly and fires to 2nd. Timmy
          snatches it down and drag-tags the invisible base runner,
          then fires to Bertram at 1st. SNAP! Outta there. Bertram
          throws back to DeNunez. Benny's ready:
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Smalls! Get one!
                         
          CRACK! THE BALL
                         
          arcs up... comes down right at
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          who raises the glove, and skippers around, as if he were
          tracking a falling leaf. The ball lands 5 feet behind him.
                         
                          
                          29
                         
                         
                          
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          shakes its collective head, exasperated.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          runs to the ball, is about to throw... runs it in to DeNunez
          instead.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Here. Sorry, sorry.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          is stunned.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          runs back to right field. Ready again - a game kid.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          trots out after him.
                         
                          BENNY
           Hey, you can throw it ya know.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No, I can't... I don't know how.
                          (LUMPY THROAT)
           Um, thanks for taking me here... but
           I think better go.
                         
          Scotty turns to leave. Benny grabs his arm.
                         
                          BENNY
           You think too much. I bet you get
           straight A's and shit, huh?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No, I got a B once. Actually it was
           an A minus.
                          (QUICK)
           But it shoulda been a B.
                         
                          BENNY
           This is baseball, you're not supposed
           to think, you're just supposed to play.
                          (BEAT)
           You ever have a paper route?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Uh, I helped a guy one time.
                         
                         
                          
                          30
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          BENNY
           Throw it like you chuck a paper. When
           your arm gets here... just let go of
           it.
                          (PAUSE)
           Just let go.
                         
          Scotty nods. Benny starts back.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Wait - how do I catch it?
                         
                          BENNY
           Don't worry. Just stand there and
           stick your glove in the air. I'll
           take care of it.
                         
                         HOME PLATE
                         
          Benny mentally calculates the distance. Puts a little rub on
          the ball. Flips it into the air...
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Smalls, get one!
                         
          ...and swings through deliberately. CRACK!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          sees it coming. Stands there stiffly. Sticks his glove up,
          closes his eyes.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Please, catch it. Please, catch it.
           Please, ca -
                         
          SNAP! His glove swings down. He opens his eyes. Looks into
          his glove. The ball is there. He takes it out and chucks
          the ball like a folded paper.
                         
                         BERTRAM
                         
          catches it good and solid at 1st.
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Okay! Hey, let's play ball!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          loosens up. From home plate
                         
                         
                          
                          31
                         
                         
                          
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          gives him a "Thumbs Up." The significance of this is only
          outweighed by his sudden fear, when...
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          glimpses something.
                         
                         SCOTTY'S POV
                         
          of some great, lumbering thing moving past a crack in those
          green fiberglass panels.
                         
          EXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK
                         
          In good spirits, the guys break off to their houses.
                         
                         SCOTTY & BENNY
                         
          split up in the middle of the street between their homes.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Thanks.
                         
          Already at his door, Benny just raises his glove in answer.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
           Wait, here - your glove.
                         
                          BENNY
           Keep it.
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Scotty opens a new writing tablet, and titles the page:
          "Baseball Stuff to Remember." He writes: "1. The Great
          Bambino?" He hasn't got a clue.
                         
          EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY
                         
          Benny coaches Scotty. Correct batting stance and swing. Benny
          thumb-flicks bottle caps at Scotty from a coffee can full.
          They're tough to hit. But soon Scotty's tagging every one of
          them.
                         
          THE SUN SETS.

          DeNunez fires - fastball. CRUNCH!

                         SCOTTY
                         
          tags it. The ball sails over

                         BENNY
                         
          gives Scotty another "Thumbs Up." The kid's in.
                         
          EXT. SANDLOT - DAY - LATER
                         
          Squints arrives with a box of baseball cards.

           card from what we called "The Dugout."
                         
          Squints shakes it up. Everybody picks one.

           It was just a shoe box, but whoever we
           picked, we got to be when it was our
           ups. One day, when Ham took his pick
           a little too seriously, the guys let
           me in on the world's most terrifying
           secret...

          INT. MERTLE'S ACRES - DAY
                         
          Blurbling pockets of super-heated muck.

                         BURNED-OUT SHELLS
                         
          of twisted vehicles - strewn carcasses. A battlefield.
                         
                         OLD APPLIANCES
                         
          that form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses.

           Mertle's Acres was a bitchin' place,
           that had everything you could ever
           imagine.
                         
                         OTHER STUFF
                         
          like savaged shopping carts. A school bus graveyard. Scrap
          motorbikes. Cargo ship buoy balls. The gutted shell of a
          fighter plane.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And the stuff was worth a fortune.
           So, one day Mr. Mertle got him this
           new pup from the pound. They were
           glad to get rid of him, on account of
           while he'd been there, he'd killed
           three dogs bigger than he was.
                          (BEAT)
           That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured
           he needed to protect his junkyard,
           'cause people kept stealing stuff at
           night, when he wasn't around.
                         
          WE DRIFT THROUGH
                         
          a maze of dark, grimy junk-passageways.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           So he bought The Beast, and set him
           loose in Mertle's Acres.
                         
          SOMETHING LOPES BY
                         
          at the end of a passage. (NOTE: We never fully see The Beast.)
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           The Beast was still just a pup of six
           months, but he already weighed a 150
           pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger.
                         
          A TRASH BAG
                         
          full of meat hits the ground - disappears. SLIFFTHT! It
          spits back INTO FRAME... empty and tattered.

           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He threw The Beast a trash bag full of
           meat every night, and just left him
           alone. All alone in the whole place
           by himself... to grow.
                         
                         AN EYEBALL
                         
          among a pile of broken headlights. As big as the headlights.
                         
          FLEETING GLIMPSES OF MORE STUFF
                         
          like Mannequins, with bite-chunks missing. Plastic flamingoes,
          brutally mangled. A decapitated "lawn jockey." A plastic
          cow, legs gnawed off. And BREATHING... amongst the artificial
          "life" forms.
                         
          A GARGANTUAN FOOTPRINT
                         
          in the center of an old truck tire.
                         
          THE BEAST'S SHOULDERS
                         
          moving powerfully - as tall as a burned-out VW.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And so, in a few months, the pup grew
           into The Beast. And he grew big as a
           car. And he grew mean, 'cause nobody
           liked him, and he didn't like nobody
           either.
                          (BEAT)
           And so he only had one thing on his
           mind... to kill.
                         
          INT. MERTLE'S ACRES - NIGHT
                         
          TWO THIEVES in ski-masks. Suddenly, a HEATED WIND strips
          their masks. Two elephantine feet come down on their faces.
          They SCREAM.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.)
           And he did. And he liked it.
                         
                         ANOTHER THIEF
                         
          suddenly enveloped by a shadow. He's dragged into darkness...
          he SCREAMS.
                         
          TWO OTHER THIEVES
                         
          load their van and take off. They skid. CRUNCH! The van
          caves in. The Thieves are dragged out, BLATHERING in horror.

          The Beast moves like a murderous phantom. WE HEAR ROARING,
          and primordial bloodlust.
                         
          VARIOUS OTHER THEIVES
                         
          are tossed hither and yon... mixed in with fake flamingoes,
          and a flying plastic cow.

          Police cars. DETECTIVES speak with MR. MERTLE; his shoulders
          slumped, his eyes moist. They show him file photos of (THEIVES

           The Beast was the most perfect junkyard
           dog that ever lived... a true killing
           machine.
                          (BEAT)
           After awhile, the police started getting
           phone calls from people, reporting all
           the missing thieves. The ones The
           Beast had killed... it added up to
           about 37 guys.
                         
          Mr. Mertle solemnly heads inside the junkyard.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           But they never found a single body...
           not one. Some people say they all got
           away, and were just so scared that
           they ended up in insane asylums and
           stuff.
                          (BEAT)
           But we know what really happened.
                         
          Mr. Mertle emerges from the junkyard. Cops take cover behind
          their cars. Guns are leveled toward Mr. Mertle and what
          follows him at the end of a rusty tow chain.
                         
           SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           The Beast... ate them.

           He ate them bones and all.

          PEOPLE slam their windows - draw their curtains. LITTLE KIDS
          are snatched up by PARENTS, who run inside and lock their

           SQUINTS (V.O.)
           The Beast was good at his guarddog
           job. Too good. So the cops said he
           had to be retired. But he didn't have
           to be killed or nothin', on account of
           there was no evidence... no bones...
           no teeth for dental records.

           SQUINTS (V.O.)
           The police told Mr. Mertle that if
           wanted to keep The Beast, he hadda
           lock him in his backyard, so he could
           never get out.

           And that he hadda chain him up, so's

          the common wall.
                         
          HE LOOKS DOWN INTO
                         
          Mr. Mertle's backyard and SEES an old footed bathtub filled
          with murky water. A steel pole, cemented into the center of
          the yard. A tow chain, snaking away from the pole and
          vanishing under the lean-to. Dust rises and falls from 'neath
          the lean-to.

           I learned that more than a 150 baseballs
           had gone over that fence... and not
           one of them was ever seen again. Even
           when some brave kid worked up enough
           courage to peek over the fence.

                          (BEAT)
           I knew it was true, because when I

          Squints and Yeah-Yeah come out of the store in a big hurry,
          with a new baseball in a box. They stop momentarily - open
          it and chuck the box. Yeah-Yeah rams his mouth full of 'zooka
                         WHILE

          spits into his palm and rubs the ball to get the shine off.
          His eyes go suddenly wide and he stares, and oggles, and gawks:
                         
          SLO-MO - A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE GIRL
                         
          about 19-years-old walks by into the store. She smiles at

           Benny would've played ball all day and
           all night... rain shine, tidal wave,
           whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball
           was the only thing he cared about and
           everything else was just a waste of
           time.

           But, of all the things we ever did
           besides baseball, goin' to the pool
           was what he tolerated best. Even though
           none of us had ever seen a Playboy
           magazine - which we constantly lied
           about - we figured the pool was the
           next best thing to being there.

           And one day, it became too much for
           Michael "Squints" Palledorous. And he
           did the most desperate thing any of us
           had ever seen.
                         
                         THE LIFEGUARD

           Oh, man...
                         
                          YEAH-YEAH
           Yeah-yeah, too cruel.
                         
                          TIMMY
           She don't know what she's doing.
                         
                          REPEAT
           She don't know what she's doing.
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah she does. She knows exactly what
           she's doing.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           I've swum here every summer of my adult
           life... and every summer there she is.

          pushes through the water, pulls himself out, and walks really
          fast to the diving board (taking off his glasses to impress
          her as he passes.)

                          (WORRIED)
           Don't-know, but that's the deep end,
           and Squints can't swim!
                         
                         SQUINTS
                         
          walks the plank to the end. Looks wantingly toward
                         
                         THE LIFEGUARD
                         
          who smiles back at him.
                         
                         SQUINTS
                         
          holds his nose. Takes the deep leap. Hits the water and...
                         
                         UNDERWATER
                         
          ...sinks like a stone. Squints grins as he founders.

                         THE LIFEGUARD
                         
          to the rescue. Seconds pass... she surfaces and lays a limp
                         SQUINTS
                         
          ON THE DECK
                         
          Everybody at the pool gathers 'round. The Lifeguard lays
          Squints flat. She administers mouth-to-mouth.
                         
          The gang watches on tense as hell.
                         
          Squints peeks at them through a secretly opened eye. As the
          Lifeguard is "saving" his sneaky life, Squints can no longer
          restrain himself, he grabs her - gives her a sloppy SMOOCH!
          She tears away. Stands up over his wimpy little form:
                         
                          LIFEGUARD
           You little pervert!
                         
          She grabs Squints by the scruff of the neck. Run-walks him
          toward the exit, and...

          out, dragging their clothes after them. They help Squints
          up.

                          SQUINTS
           A'course I did. Been plannin' it for
           years.
                         
          They let Squints walk out front:

           Michael "Squints" Palledorous walked a
           little taller that day. And we had to
           tip our hats to him. He was lucky she
           hadn't beat the crap out of him. We
           wouldn't have blamed her. What he'd
           done was sneaky, rotten and low.
                          (BEAT)
           And cool.
                          (BEAT)
           Not another one among us would've ever,
           even for a million dollars, had the
           guts to put the move on the Lifeguard.
           He did. He had kissed a woman. And
           he kissed her long and good.
                          (BEAT)
           We got banned from the pool forever
           that day... but every time we walked
           by after that, the Lifeguard looked
           down from her watchtower, right over
           at Squints... and smiled.

          near the green fence. Left Field is in the left. Double play
          gets two outs. Triple play is impossible. Single is good.
          Double is better. Home run is best. And, ominously, "Don't

           We all knew Benny was different. We
           knew that he was gonna go on to bigger
           and better games.

           Benny was there to call us back.

          Bertram passes it around. Everybody sniffs.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Whadda you do with it?
                         
                          HAM

          Bertram pinches a too-huge wad. Stuffs it in his mouth. The
          bag goes around. All cud up.

           Let's ride.
                         
          The gang gets on the ride: THE ANTI-GRAV!
                         
          EXT. CARNIVAL - ABOARD ANTI-GRAV - NIGHT
                         
          As they ride, and spin round and round and round... the brown
          glop falls from their mouths. They all watch
                         
                         BERTRAM

          EXT. ANTI-GRAV - NIGHT
                         
          yawns breakfast, lunch, and dinner like a firehose. At least
          that's what WE HEAR as the ride spins vertical - that, and a
          host of blood curddling SCREAMS from vom-victims. As the
                         RIDERS DISEMBARK
                         
          A BARF CHAIN REACTION
                         
          ensues. They all running SCREAMING from the ride and lose
          it.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The gang wobbles, MOANING as they go. Ham is strangely
          unaffected he unpockets a fistful of some digusting glorp:
                         
          The guys lose it. WE DRIFT off them and their predicament to

          Scotty's cod belly white and jelly fish limp, from a long
          bout of the chuckies.
                         
          Bill tosses his luggage in the car trunk. Scotty's mom leans
          out the driver's window.
                         
                          MOM
           I'll be back in an hour, Scotty, I'm
           taking Dad to the airport.

           things while I'm gone. I'm counting
           on you.
                         
          He offers his hand to Scotty. They shake.

          The gang comes out with a new boxed baseball. Each has a
          pack of Topps. A bag of Bazooka.

           Once we got over trying to be big shots,
           we just stuck to what we could handle,
           and swore off the hard stuff forever.
           When we finally got back together for
           some baseball, something amazing
           happened.
                          (BEAT)
           It was an omen... one that was meant
           just for Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.

          They tear open their packs of baseball cards. First things
          first - they eat the gum sticks. Then, shuffle through the
          cards looking for gold.

          staring down at the cards in his hands. He slowly shuffles
          them top to bottom... top to bottom.

           You okay, man?
                         
          Benny slowly raises his eyes. Slowly holds the cards out to
          Squints, who takes them cautiously. Squints shuffles them
          forwards and backwards. He passes the eight cards amongst
          them all.

           We all expected something to happen
           right then... during that game. What
           we had just witnessed was bordering on
           the supernatural... we knew that greater
           hands than ours were at work.
                          (BEAT)
           And it happened alright.

           C'mon, Benny, maybe two, three guys in
           history have ever busted the guts out
           of a ball. That's what the omen was.

                          DENUNEZ
           No, you didn't. It's the most amazing
           thing I ever seen.
                         
                          BENNY
           Anybody got any money?
                          (NO ANSWER)
           Then it ain't okay, 'cause now we can't
           play no more.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah, we can.
                         
                          BENNY
           What, you got 98 extra cents just layin'
           around at home, Smalls?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No, but I got a ball.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. BILL'S DEN - DAY
                         
          A BASEBALL on a silver pedestal (Bill's baseball). Scotty's
          HAND ENTERS FRAME. His indecisive FINGERS almost touch the
          ball... then, SNATCH!
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          Scotty dashes across the schoolyard.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           (out of breath)
           I got it! Let's play!
                         
          He tosses the ball to
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          who catches it.
                         
                          BENNY
           Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups.
                         
          Benny hands Scotty the bat, heads to right field, leaving
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          alone at home plate with Ham (the catcher).
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          tosses DeNunez the ball on his way by.
                         
                          
                          72
                         
                         
                          
                         
                         DENUNEZ
                         
          almost misses it. He rounds up, throws to
                         
                         BERTRAM
                         
          at 1st. Bertram throws to
                         
                         TIMMY
                         
          at 2nd. Timmy almost drops it. There's a smudge on the ball.
          Timmy tosses to
                         
                         REPEAT
                         
          at 3rd. Repeat fires to
                         
                         YEAH-YEAH
                         
          in left. The ball caroms off Yeah-Yeah's glove, comes down
          fast! Yeah-Yeah barehands it. Safe. He launches to
                         
                         SQUINTS
                         
          in center. It's gonna be short! Squints sprints - Willy
          Mays basket catch. He throws to DeNunez.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          digs in.
                         
                          HAM
           Batter up!
                         
                         DENUNEZ
                         
          fires. Scotty swings - WHIFF. Again - whif. Once more...
                         
          BOOM! Goodnight, Irene! Scotty drops the bat. Trots for
          first base in "home run" fashion.
                         
                         BENNY

                         SCOTTY
                         
          watches him, slowing, worrying.
                         
                         THE BALL
                         
          drops over the green fiberglass fence.

                         SCOTTY
                         
          stops dead in the base path.

           Nice crank, Smalls.
                         
                          DENUNEZ
           Decent cut.
                         
                          BENNY
           It's outta here! Who's got the big
           bat now, boys!

                         SCOTTY
                         
          is drawn to the fence with mounting terror.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          starts over.
                         
                          HAM
           What the hell's he doing?
                         
                          BERTRAM
           Maybe the shock of his first homer was
           just too much for him.
                         
          AT THE GREEN FIBERGLASS FENCE
                         
          Scotty runs right up to it - clutches desperately. Panting.
          Trembling. The guys arrive. Scotty turns back to them... he
          has aged 25 years.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           We gotta get that ball back.
                         
                          HAM
           Right! Good one, Smalls.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Sure. We'll just hop over and say,
           excuse me Mr. Beast sir, could we have
           our ball back, oh, and please don't
           kill us while we're here!

                          BENNY
           It was a great shot, but forget about
           it... game's over. We'll get another
           ball.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           You don't understand!
                         
                          BENNY
           Sure we do. You feel bad 'cause you
           belted a homer, and now we can't play
           no more.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           No! You don't understand! THAT WASN'T
           MY BALL!
                         
          THE GANG'S POV
                         
          of something moving in the backyard. Just a rippling shadow
          and trailing dust accompanying it over the fence top.

                          SQUINTS
           Whadda you mean it wasn't your ball?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           It's my stepdad's. I stole it from
           his trophy room. It was a present or
           soemthing - somebody gave it to him.
           We have to get it back. He's gonna
           kill me!
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Smalls... listen to me. This is a
           matter of life and death.
                          (THINKS)
           Where did your old man get that ball?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           I dunno... I think some lady gave it
           to him.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           Some lady?...
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yeah, she even signed her name on it.

          WHAT THEY SEE
                         
          a baseball in a little impact crater. A ball that has most
          clearly been autographed by... BABE RUTH.
                         
          A long, hideous forelimb thrusts from 'neath the lean-to. A
          massive paw-thing comes down on the ball. Drags it slowly
          away... leaving a baseball-deep furrow in the dirt. The
                         
          CANINE "LAUGHTER" comes again...

          drops from the fence - turn to face Scotty.

           Smalls, you mean to tell me you went
           home and swiped a ball that was signed
           by Babe Ruth, and brought it out here
           and actually played with it?

           Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest
           baseball player that ever lived. People
           say he was less than a God, but more
           than a man. Ya know... like Hercules
           or somethin'.

          Suddenly - SNAP! Ham pulls the stick back. 'Tis toothpick'd.

          and shove the pipe under the green fiberglass. HORRIBLE SOUNDS
          ERUPT from the Badlands. Dust mushrooms over the fence. The
          pipe draws under in FEROCIOUS JERKS. Gone. Moments. The
          pole sails back over the fence - bounces on the asphalt with
          ANGRY CLANGS. 'Tis pretzel'd.

          illuminating the photo of The Babe.
                         
                          BENNY
           We can't get it back, Babe.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Suddenly, a RACKET from inside Benny's closet. A bright LIGHT
          GOES ON in there. Then, smoke comes out.
                         
          Benny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall. Hasn't
          done this in years:
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           M - M - Mom?...
                         
          The closet door CREAKS open... by itself. Everything inside
          is oddly devoid of color.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Who's there?!
                         
          BABE RUTH steps out of the closet. He exists in the only way
          any kid from 1962 has ever seen him: BLACK & WHITE.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Now don't go peeing your pants or
           nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a
           hand.
                         
          The Great Bambino PUFFS on a massive stogie... the source of
          all the smoke.
                         
                          BENNY
           B - B - But, you're...
                         
                          THE BABE
           ...dead? Legends never die, kid.
                         
          Benny comes off the wall. The enormous Ruth towers over him.
                         
                          BENNY
           You're really him. You're The Babe.
           The Sultan of Swat. The King -
                         
                         
                         
                          
                          94
                         
                         
                          
                         
                          THE BABE
           - of Krash and a hundred other dopey
           names. Forget about that, we ain't
           got much time. I'm here 'cause you're
           in some kinda pickle, right?
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah.
                         
                          THE BABE
           A baseball with my John Hancock on it
           went over a fence, and you can't get
           it back. Right?
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah, right.
                         
                          THE BABE
           (clear and simple)
           Then just hop over there and get it.
           There ya go. Problem solved.
           (tips his cap)
           See ya, kid.
                         
          The Babe turns to go back to wherever he came from. Benny
          grabs his arm - shocked that he actually feels something
          "real."
                         
                          BENNY
           Wait! I can't.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Can't what?
                         
                          BENNY
           Go into that backyard.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Why not?
                         
                          BENNY
           There's a Beast back there.
                         
                          THE BABE
           What kind?
                         
                          BENNY
           A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one
           kid already.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid.

           Everybody gets one chance to do
           something great. Most people either
           never take the chance 'cause they're
           too scared, or they don't recognize it
           when it spits on their shoes.
                          (BEAT)
           This is your "big chance," and ya
           shouldn't let it go by.

           Remember those cards you got the other
           day?
                         
                          BENNY
           Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in
           the same pack.
                         
                          THE BABE
           What're the odds on that?
                         
                          BENNY
           About a zillion to one.
                         
                          THE BABE
           More even. Someone's tellin' you
           somethin', kid. And if I was you...
           I'd listen.
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah, but what?
                         
                          THE BABE
           You're the one with the rubba legs.
           Figure it out.
                          (BEAT)
           You gotta do what your heart tells

                          BENNY
           You mean, I should hop that fence -
           and pickle with THE BEAST?!
                         
                          THE BABE
           Lemme tell you something... you
           remember that called shot homer I hit?
                         
                          BENNY
           Sure, the greatest most famous and
           legendary home run of all time.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Yeah, right, well said.

                          BENNY
           Sure ya did, Babe.
                         
                          THE BABE
           Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the
           way down to first I kept sayin' to
           myself, "you lucky bum."
                          (BEAT)
           Think about that, kid. I'll see ya
           later.
                         
          The Babe disappears back into the closet, then:
                         
           THE BABE'S VOICE
           Remember, kid. There's heroes and
           there's Legends. Heroes get
           remembered... but Legends never die.
                          (BEAT)
           Follow your heart, kid, and you'll
           never go wrong.
                         
          A RACKET in the closet matching:
                         
          INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - DAY
                         
          KNUCKLES on glass. Scotty hurries sleepy-eyed to the window
          and opens it. Benny stands outside, holding a shoe box.
                         
                          BENNY
                          (WITH PURPOSE)
           I had a dream. Get dressed. We're
           goin' to the sandlot.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          The guys march toward the rising sun - across the sandlot
          behind Benny. Toward destiny.
                         
          THE GREEN FIBERGLASS FENCE
                         
          They stop here. Benny steps forward. He opens the shoe box.
          Laces on brand new P.F. Flyers. Moves for the fence. Scotty
          grabs his arm.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Benny - wait. It's okay, it was my
           fault. I'll just take whatever I get.
           You don't have to do this.
                         
                         
                          
                          97
                         
                         
                          
                         
          A look in Benny's eyes. Kismet.
                         
                          BENNY
                          (PREDESTINED)
           Yeah I do, Smalls. I have to.
                         
          Benny turns from him - swallows hard. Swings himself onto
                         THE
                         
          TOP OF THE FENCE
                         
          and balances - deciding.
                         
           THE BABE'S VOICE
           (in Benny's head)
           ...Follow your heart, kid, and you'll
           never go wrong.
                         
          Benny turns back one last time. Gives Scotty "Thumbs Up."
          With a pearl diver's breath - he plunges into...
                         
          EXT. BADLANDS - DAY
                         
          ...here. He stands fixed, staring hard 'neath the lean-to.
                         
                         DUST RISES
                         
          from thereunder. ORGANIC EXHAUST. The LAZY CLINKS of heavy
          chain links... The Beast is rising to its feet.
                         
                         IT MATERIALIZES
                         
          piece by piece: fore feet the size of a catcher's mitt, bulking
          head and shoulders, hulking flank and haunches.
                         
                         BENNY'S
                         
          mouth hangs open. He's frozen, staring at
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          and it's worse than Squints recounted... because it's real.
          This is the biggest dog that ever lived! 300 lbs. 4 1/2
          feet tall. And ugly. This was a bad idea. The Beast lingers
          8 feet away with slack in the chain.
                         
          THWOOOP! It spits something out, which rolls in the dirt...
                         STOPS EXACTLY
                         
                         BETWEEN THEM
                         
          A goo-slobbered ball. Dirty Beast-foam drips off, revealing
          the smeared signature, B A B E R U T H. "G'head kid, I dare
          you!"

                         A PICKLE
                         
          Benny measures The Beast. Times its ballooning chest.
                         
          The Beast's eyes glue to Benny. Flopping, hot-water-bottle
          tongue PANTS. Licks chops. Leather'd nose twitches - smelling
          for movement.
                         
                         THE TOE
                         
          of Benny's P.F. Flyer digs into the cracked earth.
                         
                         CLINK
                         
          the Beast leans forward - one chain link lifts from the ground.
                         
          SHTHUFT!
                         
          Benny spits, blowing his tanks.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          bristles.
                         
                         BENNY'S EYES
                         
          widen, focusing.
                         
          WAR BREAKS OUT!
                         
          Benny goes for the ball.
                         
                         THE BEAST'S
                         
          knotted muscles quaver and UNCOIL.
                         
                         BENNY'S
                         
          P.F. Flyers leave behind tiny dust roosters.
                         
                         THE BEAST'S
                         
          claws dig deep furrows. FOG BANKS of dust spread out behind
          it. Forelegs gallop at flared, over-anxious angles.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          leaves scrambling footprints. He slides - grabs the ball -
          "Pops-Up" Maury Wills fashion - heads back for the fence.
          The ball slips from Benny's fingers. Re-grabs it - shoves
          the ball in his teeth, freeing his hands for the leap up the
          fence.

                         THE BEAST
                         
          gains. SHNAPP! Jaws SHUT like a tripped bear trap.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          springs off the ground. He's on the fence.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          reaches chain's end - it goes taught. Breaks! The two foot
          length still attached to The Beast's neck bullwhips - the
          chain catches Benny in the butt.
                         
                          BENNY
           YOWWWWW!
                         
          He vaults over the fence.
                         
          EXT. SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          The gang looks up. A great shadow envelopes them.
                         
          THE BEAST IS LOOSE!
                         
          The guys turn to stone. Benny takes off.
                         
                          BENNY
           OOOOH SSSSHIT!
                         
          The Beast tears by the guys after Benny. The two vanish out
          of the sandlot.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           What're we waitin' for?! Let's go
           after 'em!
                         
          EXT. SIDEWALK - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
                         
          Benny runs. The Beast is gaining. In its wake: dichondra
          lawns RIPPED to shreds. Scotty and the guys make tracks a
          block behind.
                         
          EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY
                         
          On display: Pinwheels, Mailbox Propellers and Puddle-Jumpers.
          Benny flies by. The Beast follows. As they pass, contact:
          the whirly-gigs take off!
                         
          INT. CAR - TRAVELING - DAY
                         
          A MOTHER drives. In the passenger seat, her TODDLER fingers
          a "scooter-pie" in marshmallowy strings.

           Mommy, mommy - wook! Ah, ah - goggy!
                          (BEAT)
           Big goggy.
                         
          The Mother looks out the passenger window.
                         
          ON THE SIDEWALK
                         
          Benny and The Beast run even. Then pull ahead.
                         
          EXT. "SNELGROVE'S" ICE CREAM - DAY

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
                         
          Benny's cookin'. The Beast follows - TRASHCANS SCATTER like
          bowling pins.
                         
          Scotty and the guys follow. All slow to check out the garbage
          bins... so many crushed beer cans.
                         
          Benny darts in the rear entrance to a "random" building. The
          Beast tears after him - KNOCKING the door off its hinges.
                         
          INT. BOYS CLUB AUDITORIUM - DAY
                         
          ON THE MOVIE SCREEN Kong does battle with T Rex.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          comes sliding AT US across the waxed stage floor - from under
          the movie screen. He slides off the stage - into midair -
          lands on his feet. Splits up the aisle between the rows of
          folding chairs and blasts out the door.
                         
                         KIDS' HEADS
                         
          turn to watch him. KONG ROARS! They look back at
                         
          THE MOVIE SCREEN
                         
          where, just as Kong proclaims himself king over the dead T
          Rex,
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          Leaps through the center of the silver screen - leaves a 6
          foot hole - lands 20 feet down the aisle - CRASHES through
          the doors and disappears.
                         
          Moments pass. Our guys follow.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
                         
          Hot-rubber SQUEAKS from Benny's P.F. Flyers. The Beast's
          claws leave jagged scars in the concrete.
                         
                         CATS HISS

          POOL HONEYS lounge, all bedecked with rock-hard, Annette
          Funicello hairdo's.
                         
          Benny blasts out of the pool building, "tire stepping" over
                         
          the Honeys. They're up and RANTING at him. Until, The Beast
          comes...
                         
          ...sliding across the water-slippy deck like an out-of-control
          anvil. He "bowling pins" the Pool Honeys. The Honeys HIT
          THE WATER.
                         
          Benny cuts back through the pool building. The Beast follows -
          parting our guys and the other Kids.
                         
          EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY
                         
          Game in progress. From outta nowhere, Benny jams across the
          diamond. The game stops... EVERYONE gapes at:
                         
          Some huge dog-beast charging after a kid.

                         BENNY
                         
          zips under the banner - runs through - grabs a Coke like a
          long distance runner.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          rages after him, through:
                         
          A DEADEND! MIDWAY
                         
          of neatly arranged display booths. (This is pie n' cake booth
          gag per storyboards - allow 2 pages.)

          Founder's Day parade (et al).
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          rips into the square. He rubba-leg zigzags, nimbly avoiding
          everything and everyone.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          Is a runaway freight train. He PLOWS through CLOWNS. CHILDREN
          are snatched from the dog's path by terrified parents. The
          Beast tears through the concession stands:
                         
                         VATS & DISPENSERS
                         
          EXPLODE! The VOLUNTEERS dash out SCREAMING - "tar n' featherd"
          with baked beans and potato chips.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          zips through the MARCHING BAND - ducking trombone slides -
          leaping glockenspiels.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          ain't so graceful. He "barn-doors" the band. CRASH! An
          instrument tangled heap.
                         
                         THE ONLOOKERS
                         
          pour into the street, knocking the MAYOR from his convertible,
          and the FOUNDER'S DAY QUEEN from her float.
                         
          FROM THIS HEIGHT
                         
          this all looks like the end of a "Dr. Suess" book!
                         
          SCOTTY AND THE GANG
                         
          search through the confusion. _They've lost Benny_! Suddenly,
          doubling back on them

          Benny's gone. Seconds later - The Beast follows.
                         
                          SQUINTS
           This way! Shortcut!

          EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY
                         
          The gang's GASPING for BREATH. And then, unbelievably
                         
          BENNY & THE BEAST
                         
          Are coming right at them! They race across the sandlot.
          Kill- anxious beast-drool splashes the seat of Benny's pants.
                         
                         THE BEAST'S
                         
          muscles flex.
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          just runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him. He
          lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor.
                         
                          BENNY
           LOOK OUT!
                         
          He lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE. He
          careens toward the bottom of
                         
          MR. MERTLE'S FENCE
                         
          hits it and, defying gravity, RUNS STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN
          FIBERGLASS PANELS!
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          jets upward, leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps -
          standing out from the fence 90 degrees - the Donald O'Connor
          "Singin' In The Rain" trick!
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          sucks air - ROARS - EXPLODES from the ground - soars, gaping
          maw first, right for
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          who pushes off the top of the fence.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          GNASHES up at Benny's heels - misses by an inch. He plummets
          toward the Badlands. Then, the unspeakable happens,

                         DROPS
                         
          THE BABE RUTH AUTOGRAPH
                         
          and comes tumbling down after the ball.
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)
           Oh noooooo!
                         
          EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
                         
          Benny HITS the dirt with a gut twisting THUD! Dust everywhere.
                         
          EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
                         
          The gang climbs the fence. They look down into
                         
          EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
                         
          where, when the dust clears, they see
                         
                         BENNY
                         
          holding the Babe Ruth Autograph up high like a trophy.
                         
                          BENNY
           I GOT IT!
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          hops down and races over. Suddenly, from the
                         
                         FENCETOP
                         
          His shirt snagged:
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help
           him!
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          is hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He struggles -
          choking to death - right below Scotty.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          petrifies where they stand.

                         SCOTTY
                         
          tears his shirt loose. Scrambles to where The Beast hangs.
          Tries to lift the tow chain free - too heavy! He'll die in
          seconds.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can
           let him off!
                          (DESPERATE)
           COME ON!
                         
                         NOBODY
                         
          moves. They wanna but they can't!
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          goes for broke. He reaches out and puts his hand on The
          Beast's head.
                         
                          SCOTTY (CONT'D)
                          (CONTACT)
           Easy. Easy, boy.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          whimpers. Scotty balances atop the fence. Grabs the tow
          chain. Lifts with all his might... his fingers bleed. The
          Beast goes limp. An inch. That did it! The beast falls.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          goes with him - 8 feet to the dirt. The FENCE COMES DOWN -
          breaking the barrier to the sandlot. He lands on the ground
                         
          NOSE TO NOSE
                         
          with The Beast.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          leaps to his feet.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          rises with him.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          freezes solid.

                         THE GANG
                         
          watches in horror.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          scans them instinctively - He might kill them all where they
          stand.
                         
                         SCOTTY'S
                         
          about to load up his fruit o' da looms.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          sticks his mammoth head right in Scotty's face. SNIFFS. That's
          it! The kid is lunch! His jowls part - hot BEAST-BREATH
          BLOWS Scotty's hair back.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          closes his eyes.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          SLAP their hands to their eyesockets.
                         
                         THE BEAST
                         
          leans closer. Mouth opens. Cold-leather nose presses against
          Scotty's forehead. Then... He licks Scotty's face.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          wipes away the Beast slob. He doesn't even have to kneel
          down to read the name on The Beast's "doggy tag." It says...
                         
          ...Hercules.
                         
          This time Scotty gives Benny "Thumbs Up."
                         
          UNDER THE LEAN-TO
                         
          Hercules digs, then stands away.
                         
                         THE GANG
                         
          steps closer. Look into the hole. Their faces light up with
          wonder. In
                         
                         THE HOLE
                         
          Are 150 baseballs.

          THE GANG'S BLOWN AWAY
                         
                          BENNY
           We can play forever now.
                         
                         SCOTTY
                         
          takes The Beast by the collar. He and Benny go to
                         
          MR. MERTLE'S BACK DOOR
                         
          Scotty KNOCKS. MR. MERTLE answers the door. An old man with
          dark glasses. He comes out on the porch.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           Hello?...
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Um, we brought your dog home.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           Hercules? How'd he get out?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Well, sir... um, we kind of, well,
           what happened was -
                         
                          BENNY
           - we hit a baseball into your yard.
           Then we tried to get it and -
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           - why didn't you just come to the
           door... I'd have gotten it for you.
                         
          Squints, Yeah-Yeah, Ham, DeNunez, Repeat, Timmy and Bertram
          faint.
                         
           MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
           Well, thanks for bringin' him back.
                          (BEAT)
           Why don't you boys come in... we can
           talk about baseball.
                         
          INT. MR. MERTLE'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Fairly spartan, except for one room, where it seems that Mr.
          Mertle spends most of his time. He leads Benny and Scotty
                         INTO
                         
          THE BASEBALL ROOM
                         
          Mr. Mertle sits at a table. Benny and Scotty stare at the
          tabletop.
                         
                          
                          108
                         
                         
                          
                         
          It holds a scale model Baseball Diamond: green felt field and
          little bases, outfield wall and miniature player figures. A
          picture on the wall of Mr. Mertle and Babe Ruth.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           You knew Babe Ruth?
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           Yeah. And he knew me too.
                          (BEAT)
           They never let us play together, but
           we were friends. Good friends. He was
           almost as great a hitter as I was.
           But, he'd of told you he was better.
                         
          The picture is signed: "To Thelonius Johnson Mertle, the second
          greatest slugger I ever saw... Babe Ruth."
                         
          A baseball game on the RADIO. As each play is CALLED, Mr.
          Mertle's hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct
          positions. Mr. Mertle is blind.
                         
           MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
                          (HOLDING BALL)
           This the one that went over my fence?
                         
                          BENNY
           Yeah.
                         
          Mr. Mertle brushes his fingers over the leather.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           This is an old ball, boys. Really
           old.
                          (BEAT)
           Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't
           he?
                         
                          SCOTTY
                          (WEAK)
           Yes, sir.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           You sound upset, son - what's wrong?
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Well, you see... that ball belongs to
           my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed
           by Babe Ruth.
                         
          Mr. Mertle shakes his head... hands the ball to Scotty.
                         
                          
                          109
                         
                         
                          
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will
           understand.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           I don't think so.
                         
          On the RADIO, Wills steals second.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
                          (TO BENNY)
           Son, move Maury Wills to second base
           for me, will ya?
                         
          Benny moves the little figure to second base.
                         
           MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
           If he steals third that'll be number
           100.
                          (TO SCOTTY)
           Helluva pickle you're in, boy.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Yes, sir...
                         
          Mr. Mertle retrieves something from a glass case. A baseball.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
           I'll make you a deal. If you boys
           come over once a week and talk baseball
           with me, I'll trade you balls.
                         
                          BENNY
           Well, that's really nice of you... but
           this ball really is signed by The Babe.
                         
           MR. MERTLE
                          (CHUCKLES)
           This one really is too... and all the
           rest of the '27 Yankees.
                         
          He hands his baseball to Scotty... Benny stares at it in
          disbelief.
                         
                          BENNY
           Oh my God - Murderers' Row.
                         
          As they ogle the ball:
                         
                          BENNY (CONT'D)

           MR. MERTLE
                          (SMILING)
           They're all there.
                         
          Scotty hands Mr. Mertle the chewed up Babe Ruth ball. Shakes
          his hand.
                         
                          SCOTTY
           Deal.
                         
          On the RADIO, Maury Wills steals 3rd for his 100th stolen
          base. Scotty notices the wall clock:
                         
          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Mom's car is in the driveway. Scotty goes up the walkway
          slowly. Benny just behind him. The gang lingers at the
          sidewalk. Scotty sets one foot on the
                         
                         PORCH
                         
          and Bill comes out. He looks none-too-pleased. He towers
          over Scotty. The gang hangs their heads.
                         
                          BILL
           This better be good.
                         
          Benny unpockets a little felt bag. Hands it to Scotty. He
          holds the bag up to a perplexed Bill, who opens it. He looks
          from Scotty to Benny and back again. Then...
                         
          ...stares down at the "Murderers' Row" ball.

          EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
                         
          A BASEBALL sailing through the air. SMACK! it's caught in a
          brand new glove. Scotty's new glove. Scotty snap throws the
          ball back to Bill. He and Scotty are having a great game of
          catch.
                         
                          NARRATOR
           It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth
           was like the Hercules of baseball, and
           then The Beast's name turned out to be
           Hercules.
                          (BEAT)
           It was also strange that Mr. Mertle
           had a Murderers' Row ball to replace
           the one signed by The Babe.

          Bill and Scotty smile as they fire the cowhide back and forth.
                         
                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)
           Some people might say that it was all
           a coincidence... but looking back at
           it now, it seems like everything was
           connected, just like me and Benny.
                          (BEAT)
           It was like we were a part of the same
           myth as The Babe... the Myth of
           Baseball.
                         
          Scotty's mom sticks her head out the back door. She smiles,
          watching her "two boys" toss the ball around.
                         
                          MOM

          Mr. Mertle sits contentedly behind his little "diamond." The
          RADIO ANNOUNCER calls Maury Wills' 104th steal of 1962.

          HIS HAND moves a wooden figure from 1st to 2nd. This tactile
                         
          "playing field" becomes...

                         THE GUYS
                         
          all play as if, somehow, this may be the last time they ever
          get to be a team. As they play, they're "sponged" from the
          PICTURE in this order: Yeah-Yeah, Repeat and Timmy, Ham,
          DeNunez, Bertram, Squints, Hercules, Scotty, Benny.

           But it would stay with us forever.
           (as they all dissolve:)
           Yeah-Yeah's parents shipped him off to
           military school. Timmy and Tommy grew
           up to build skyscrapers. Ham went to
           college and became a pediatrician.
           DeNunez played triple A ball and never
           got to the majors. Bertram got really
           into the sixities and no one ever saw
           him again. Squints grew up and married
           Wendy Peffercorn; they bought the Five
           & Dime and they still own it to this
           day. Hercules lived to be 199 years
           old... in human years.

           After Benny pickled the Beast, his
           reputation spread all over town. From
           then on he was known as Benny "The

           That's a triple, and that'll put the

                          (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
           I don't believe it! Lasorda's calling
           up the "Old Man" to pinch-run in the
           biggest clutch situation this season!
           They say the veteran's lost a step or
           two. But if I were you, I'd get ready
           for some fireworks.

          is on its feet as 40-year-old BENNY "THE JET" RODRIGUEZ takes
          over third base from the PLAYER already there. They shake
          hands on the exchange. The 3rd base COACH walks over to The
          Jet. Pats him on the back.

                         THE JET

          ...The Jet moves. So fast that no one knows he's gone till
          it's too damn late. The Pitcher awkwardly throws home. The

          spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
          white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)
          dances amongst the nimbus.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)
           --Like something is brewing,
           about to begin--
          The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
          through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small
          town in the distance.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)
           --Can't put me finger on what lies

                          IN STORE--
          Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,
          bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
          There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
          the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
          park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
          flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
          She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
          to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
          concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
          will also know as GINTY.)

           TRAVERS (V.O.)
           --But I feel what's to happen, all

                          HAPPENED BEFORE--
          Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of
          a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind
          becomes real.

                         

          INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA'S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961)

          P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position
          as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the
          sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of
          stiff and steely determination.
          Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha
          smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the
          walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
          men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit
          on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
          Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,
          white.
          Downstairs the doorbell rings.
          Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.
          It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,
          smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.

          INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

          Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of
          sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.
          DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked
          inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.

                          DIARMUID
           Mrs Travers.

                         

          INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Pamela and Diarmuid sit in silence. Diarmuid looks at her,
          she looks out of the window.

                          DIARMUID PAMELA
          You're ready to--? Like pink clouds on sticks.

                         

                          DIARMUID
           Excuse me?

                          PAMELA
           The cherry blossoms

                          (BEAT)
           I was trying to think of what they--
          Diarmuid looks at his watch.

                          DIARMUID
           The car should be here, may I use--

                          (THE PHONE)

                          PAMELA

                          (OVER)
           I cancelled it.

                          DIARMUID
           You--?

                          (PANICKED)
           What? Pamela!

                          PAMELA
           Mrs Travers.

                          DIARMUID
           Mrs Travers, please, why--
           (sugaring his tone)
           Why would you cancel the car?

                          PAMELA
           I shan't be going.
          Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.

                          DIARMUID
           We've been through this--

                          PAMELA
           I've changed my mind.

                          DIARMUID
           You can't.

                          PAMELA
           With all due respect Mr Russell I
           am on very good terms with my own
           faculty and exceedingly confident
           in its decision making
           capabilities.
          Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long
          frustrated breath.

                          DIARMUID
           You made an agreement. Do you
           understand? A verbal agreement.

                          PAMELA
           Why in the world are you speaking
           to me as if I am a neonate?

                          DIARMUID

                          HE'LL--

                          PAMELA
           He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome
           to every penny I don't have.

                          DIARMUID

                          LOOK--

                          (HE SIGHS)
           --I've represented you for a long
           time. I like to think of you as a

                          FRIEND--
          Pamela snorts.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)
           I like to think of it, believe me I
           know it's not reciprocated.

                          (BEAT)
           I would never suggest you do
           something that would cause you
           anguish but there's no more money
           Pamela-- Mrs Travers. Simply no
           more. Sales have dried up, no more
           royalties. You refuse to write
           further books so--

                          (BEAT)
           Do you understand? I'm frightened
           that you don't understand what that
           means.
          Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus.

                          PAMELA
           I know what he's going to do to her-
           - she'll be cavorting and
           twinkling! Careening towards a
           happy ending like a kamikaze--

                          DIARMUID
           --We've been trying to do this deal
           for twenty years! He's agreed to
           both your stipulations. No
           animation, script approval-- I--

                          PAMELA
           Use her to pay my bills? If I
           believed in a hell I'd be sitting
           in its waiting room--

                          DIARMUID

                          (OVER)
           --script approval! He's never
           granted anything like that before!
           I don't know what else to--
          He looks around.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)
           Where is Polly?

                          PAMELA
           I fired her.
          Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           It's just as well. It seems I can't
           afford her anymore anyway!
          Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (MOMENTARILY SOFT)
           You don't know how much she means
           to me.

                          DIARMUID
           Polly?

                          PAMELA
           Of course not Polly!
          Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           (it's a filthy word)
           Los Angeles.

                          DIARMUID
           You have only to go there and work
           for two weeks. Collaborate. That's
           it. You haven't signed the rights
           over, yet.

                          PAMELA
           Yet!

                          DIARMUID
           You must make it work Mrs Travers--

                          PAMELA
           Oh I must, must I?

                          DIARMUID
           You need the money. I don't want
           you to see you-- (broke).

                          PAMELA

                          (OVER)
           Stop saying money! It's a filthy,
           disgusting word!

                          DIARMUID
           I am picking up the telephone Mrs

                          TRAVERS--
          Diarmuid gets up.

                          PAMELA
           I have final say?

                          DIARMUID
           You do.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)
           I have final say.

                          (TO DIARMUID)

                          (MORE)

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           And if I don't like what they are
           doing to her?

                          DIARMUID
           You don't sign the papers. He
           cannot make the film unless you
           grant the rights.

                          (BEAT)
           It's an exploratory trip--
          Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away
          from the tree and sticks to her living room window.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)
           What do you say?

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)
           I want to keep my house.

                         

          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY

          A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and
          smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild
          poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.

                          TRAVERS
           Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my
           daughter? I was quite sure I had
           left her around here somewhere!
          Ginty giggles.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-
           - goodness! I've quite forgotten!
           Could it be Prunella?

                          GINTY
           No!

                          TRAVERS
           Pamela?

                          GINTY
           No.

                          TRAVERS
           You're right still doesn't sound
           quite-- I'm sure I have a special
           name for her--

                          GINTY
           Ginty!

                          TRAVERS
           Why, thank you ma'am! Ginty it is
           of course!

                          (BEAT)
           Now, have you seen her?

                          GINTY
           It's me!
          Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her
          face.

                          TRAVERS
           Gosh! So it is! Well, thank
           goodness for that! I was positive I
           was going to be beheaded for losing
           Her Highness The Royal Princess
           Ginty Mc Featherfluffy!

                          GINTY
           You can't lose me!

                          TRAVERS
           Never. I promise. I will never lose
           you!
          He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through
          the park, neighing like a horse.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Hurry now! We mustn't be late! The
           adventure is about to begin!

                         

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet
          bag into an overhead locker.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Can I help you?

                          PAMELA
           I'm perfectly capable thank you.
          The flight attendant tries to help anyway.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           They've used all the space; so
           greedy.
          She glares at the people around her.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           I'll take it Madam. I can put it
           up here -

                          PAMELA
           I don't want it up there. I want it
           here, in the corresponding holding
           area for my assigned seat!

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           The flight's closing in just a few
           moments Ma'am. I'll have to take
           it.
          Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare
          you.' A woman, with an infant, stands up.

                          WOMAN

                          (TO ATTENDANT)
           You can put my bag up front
           instead.
          The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the
          woman's bag with Pamela's.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO WOMAN)
           Will the child be a nuisance? It's
           an eleven hour flight.

                          WOMAN

                          (TAKEN ABACK)
           Er-- no, I--

                          PAMELA
           Jolly good.
          Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to
          the window, she looks out at the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO HERSELF)
           I hope we crash.
          The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!

                         

          EXT. GOFF RESIDENCE - MARYBOROUGH - DAY (1906)

          BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak -
          stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases
          bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as
          she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from
          his shoulders and plops her on the ground.

                          MARGARET
           The carriage?

                          TRAVERS
           Who needs a carriage my love? A
           stroll is a gift!
           (beat, excited)
           Everybody ready?

                          GINTY & BIDDY
           Yes. Yep!
          Margaret takes her youngest child MOYA (1) from the nanny.

                          TRAVERS
           Come along my team! We mustn't miss
           the train.

                          MARGARET
           (to her staff)
           Thank you so much. For everything.

                          GINTY

                          (TO NANNY)
           See you soon Katie Nanna!
          She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away,
          heartbroken.

                          TRAVERS
           Walking bus!
          The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in
          the lead.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Don't forget Andrew!
          Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps
          her sister too.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Ready? And off we go!
          Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as
          Travers and the girls march down the street.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Left, right, left, right! Coming
           through!
          Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a
          picture of the home she leaves behind.

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN MARYBOROUGH - DAY

          The procession continues into the bustling downtown.

          EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

          It's hectic as tickets are purchased and a CLERK marks a
          chalkboard with destinations and mileage. Ginty stops, looks
          at the list. The last city is--

                          GINTY

                          ALLORA--

                         

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

          The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward
          from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake
          of Allora.

                         

          EXT. ANGLE ON MARYBOROUGH - DAY

          As it disappears. Ginty stands on the last train platform,
          watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.
          Ginty's face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede
          as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame.

                         

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Pamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open. She's disturbed
          by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if
          somehow batting the memories away. She sighs loudly and digs
          her heel into the carpet of the plane.

                         

          INT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY

          A bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals
          area. She's immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of
          signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:
          she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling
          upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath "Walt Disney
          Presents".

                          PAMELA
           Oh does he indeed?
          She approaches the uniformed driver (RALPH - Mickey Mouse on
          his lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile.

                          RALPH
           Travers? P.L. Travers?

                          PAMELA
           Mrs.

                          RALPH
           Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome
           to the City of Angels.
          Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)
           Let me take those.

                          PAMELA
           I'm perfectly capable of-- Oh,
           nevermind.
          Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors--

                         

          EXT. LAX - DAY

          --and into the sunlight.

                          RALPH
           Sun came out to say hello just to
           you.

                          PAMELA
           Don't be preposterous.
          Pamela sniffs the air.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           It smells. Like--

                          RALPH
           Jasmine.

                          PAMELA
           --chlorine and sweat.
          Ralph chuckles.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           It's dreadful.

                         

          EXT. LIMOSINE - DAY

          The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega
          Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish
          billboard advertising.

                         

          INT. LIMOSINE - DAY

          Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car.
          She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in-
          car bar.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)
           Absurd.
          Ralph looks at her in the rearview.

                          RALPH
           You okay back there Mrs P.L.
           Travers?

                          PAMELA
           It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs--
           Oh, it's so hot.

                          RALPH
           No problemo! We got a brand new air
           conditioning system, Missus; cool
           you right down in no time. Just
           about make you feel like you're in
           good old Engerland again! Things
           they can put in cars these days--
           (he shakes his head in

                          AMAZEMENT)
           Gosh almighty.
          Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around,
          finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between
          passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's
          natter.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)
           (happy as a clam)
           No problemo.

                         

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

          With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel
          resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun.
          The limo glides into the forecourt.

                         

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

          A porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her
          belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway.

                          PORTER
           Would you like me to unpack for you
           ma'am?

                          PAMELA
           Unpack?

                          PORTER
           To take your items from their cases
           and hang them in the wardrobe
           ma'am.

                          PAMELA
           Young man, if it is your wish to
           handle ladies garments I suggest
           you take employment in a
           launderette.
          The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Yes?
          His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She
          closes the door on him.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Odd.
          She turns and for the first time takes in--

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Oh my.
          --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent
          beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather
          diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across
          every surface of the room.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Oh no, no, no.
          Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit
          baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald,
          Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the
          BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope.

          BIGGER!
          Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust
          for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the
          fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing
          over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands
          before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           (muttering to the pears)
           This won't do.
          She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is
          greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--

                         

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

          --Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the
          children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From
          their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling
          red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new
          home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush
          greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.
          A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few
          skinny chickens strut about the porch.

                          TRAVERS
           A palace! Complete with mighty
           steed.

                          GINTY
           And chickens.

                          MARGARET

                          OH--
          Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.

                          TRAVERS
           We'll build beautiful memories here
           my angel.
          Margaret offers him a trusting smile.

                          MARGARET
           Yes.
          Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards
          their new home. The chickens scatter.

                          TRAVERS
           (in the distance)
           --in this house you get to share a
           bedroom!
          Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply
          nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.

                         

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAY


                         UNDERWATER
          SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then
          another SPLOSH!
          We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony
          throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free
          swimming pool.

                         

          INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS


                          PAMELA
           Good riddance.
          She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO HERSELF)
           Well, first things first.
          She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in
          a closet.
          She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where
          the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the
          entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER!

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Good Lord.
          Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the
          floor, facing the wall.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO MICKEY)
           And you can stay there until you
           learn the art of subtlety.
          Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes
          from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night
          stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.
          The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,
          the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come
          streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses
          windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature
          Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed
          picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down
          an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           There.
          Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in
          front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns
          her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans
          forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly
          unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (SATISFIED)
           Yes.
           (answering an imaginary

                          QUESTION)
           Well, no, I don't suppose I do
           mind.
          She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as
          an ugly snort.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Now, really! Flatterer!
           (then scolding herself)
           Silly girl.
          She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a
          remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it
          at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the
          TV bursts into life.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Oh!
          She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A
          housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is
          the greatest thing ever invented.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Soap for the brains.
          She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a
          black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes
          that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly
          face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of
          Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Well, well-- There you are.

          CU: TV SCREEN
          Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out.

                          WALT
           Don't worry! There's nothing wrong
           with your television set. This is a
           pixie bell, the sound is much too
           high for human ears.
          Tinkerbell flies into shot.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Oh there you are Tink!
          She covers Walt in fairy dust.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

                          (LAUGHING)
           Hey! Get that stuff off of me!

                          (TO AUDIENCE)
           You know, a little sprinkling of
           fairy dust can make you fly!
          Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then
          just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and
          switches him off.

                          PAMELA
           Off! That's how we deal with you.

                         

          EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

          A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door.

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes
          her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.
          The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her
          bed.

                         

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

          Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately,
          not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and
          Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car
          and rush round to open the passenger door.

                          RALPH
           Good morning Mrs!

                          PAMELA
           It's not Mrs, it's-- Oh, why do I
           bother? We're just not going to get
           it right are we?

                          RALPH
           Hm?

                          PAMELA
           Will it be the same driver every
           day?

                          RALPH
           (oblivious to her tone)
           Yes ma'am! I'm all yours.

                          (BEAT)
           Sun came out again!

                          PAMELA
           You say it like you're surprised.
           Like the sun is particular about
           whom it appears for. It seems you
           think that I am responsible for
           it's miraculous dawning every day.
           For goodness sake, it's California!

                          RALPH
           It certainly is!
          He gestures for her to get in.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)
           (trying a British accent)
           Madame.
          Pamela grimaces.

          INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS

          Pamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap.
          Ralph climbs into the driver's seat.

                          PAMELA
           (as much to herself as

                          RALPH)
           I would so much rather be
           accountable for the rain.

                          RALPH
           Oh, that's sad.

                          PAMELA
           Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.
           I shan't bother explaining why;

                          IT'LL SIMPLY
           (she makes gesture for
           flying over his head)
           Zip!

                          RALPH
           Okey dokey.

                          PAMELA
           The rain brings life!

                          RALPH
           So does the sun.

                          PAMELA
           Be quiet!

                          RALPH
           Yes ma'am.
          Ralph starts the engine and drives away.

                         

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          THREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the
          enormous gates of Disney's Burbank Studio and pulls up in a
          very twee forecourt.
          They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT
          (34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has
          a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.
          Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help
          her from the vehicle but she pushes it away.

                          DON
           Pamela! Good morning!

                          PAMELA
           It is so discomfiting to hear a
           perfect stranger use my first name.
           Mrs Travers. Please.
          The Sherman's look at each other. Uh oh.

                          DON
           I do apologize, Mrs Travers.

                          (BEAT)
           I am Don DaGradi, the script
           writer.

                          PAMELA
           Co-script-writer. I shall certainly
           be having my say Mr. DiGraydi.

                          DON
           Gradi. Wonderful! I welcome it.

                          PAMELA
           If indeed we ever sign off on a
           script.
          Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu ?

                          DON
           Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of
           your team, Dick and Bob Sherman!
           Music and lyrics.

                          (TO SHERMANS)
           Boys, this is the one and only Mrs
           P.L. Travers, creator of our
           beloved Mary.

                          PAMELA
           Poppins.

                          DON
           Who else?

                          PAMELA
           Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.
           (to Dick and Bob)
           A pleasure to meet you, though I
           fear we shan't be acquainted for
           too long.

                          BOB
           Excuse me?

                          PAMELA
           These books simply do not lend
           themselves to chirping and
           prancing. No. Certainly not a
           musical. Now, where is Mister
           Disney? I'd very much like to get
           this started and finished as
           briskly as is humanly possible.

                          BOB
           Don?

                          DICK PAMELA
          Not a music--? If you'll point me in his
           direction?

                         

                          DON
           Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a
           little tour of the studio for you

                          MRS TRAVERS--

                          PAMELA
           No thank you.

                          DON
           --Wanted to show the place off.

                          PAMELA
           No one likes a show off.
          Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building.

                          DON
           Mrs Trav-- it's a long way to--
          Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder
          the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly
          amusing.

                         

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios
          on a golf buggy.

                          PAMELA
           I am perfectly capable of walking.
          A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to
          the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to
          Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Shoo! Go away!
          The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod
          meaning `beat it'.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Ghastly.
          Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock.

          INT. DISNEY - EXTERIOR OFFICE - DAY

          Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office,
          where DOLLY - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at
          her.

                          DON

                          (TO DOLLY)
           Could you let--

                          PAMELA
           (over, to Dolly)
           Would you let Mister Disney know I
           have arrived please?
          Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and
          picks up the phone.

                          DOLLY
           (whispering into phone)
           She's here!

                          DON
           A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I
           may.

                          PAMELA
           You may. Whether I heed it or not
           will be another matter entirely.

                          DON
           Wow. Uhm. It's just that he can't
           stand being called Mr Disney. We
           are all on a first name basis here.

                          (TO DOLLY)
           Dolly! Is he--?
          We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the
          flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms
          outstretched.

                          WALT
           Well, there ya are at last!
          Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way
          serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to
          greet her.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Oh my dear gal!
          Pamela is open mouthed.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           You can't imagine how excited I am
           to finally meet you!
          Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of
          enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to
          get her in an embrace.

                          PAMELA
           Oh!
          He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to
          compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in
          decades!

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Hum-- ah. It's an honour, Mister
           Disney.
          Disney winces.

                          WALT
           Walt, you gotta call me Walt, ya
           know. `Mister Disney' was my old
           man.
          There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old
          man.'

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Come here! Come here!
          He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads
          her into his interior office past an imposing floor to
          ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.

                         

          INT. DISNEY - INTERIOR OFFICE - DAY

          He smiles at TOMMIE - who mans the second desk.

                          WALT
           Tommie, say hi to the one and only
           P L Travers!

                          TOMMIE
           Hi there! It's so nice to--
          But Pamela has already been whisked through to Disney's
          personal office.

                         

          INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Disney's office is tastefully furnished and filled with
          pictures of his daughters and wife. Framed posters of his
          films provide splashes of color to the cream walls.

                          WALT
           Have a seat, sit down.
          He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a
          seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign
          above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of
          the desk, close to her, gazing at her.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Ya know, I can't believe it. P.L.
           Travers, right here, in my office,
           after all these years-- almost
           twenty of `em.
           (shakes his head)
           Twenty. Long. Years.
          Pamela narrows her eyes.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Wish ya coulda' seen me then Pam!
           As lean as a whippet I was! A race
           horse!
          Interestingly, she doesn't pull him up on using her first
          name and shortening it too!

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           But now, here you are. Look at you!
           I could eat you up!

                          PAMELA
           That wouldn't be appropriate.
          He turns a photo of his daughters - Diane and Sharon - to
          face Pamela.

                          WALT
           When Diane here was seven years old
           I-- can I get you a drink? Coffee?
           Soda?

                          PAMELA
           A pot of tea would be most welc--

                          WALT

                          (OVER)
           She was seven years old and I was
           walking past her bedroom and there
           she was on her bed reading to
           Sharon, and well, they were just
           giggling their little socks off!
           (he picks up the phone,
           presses a button)
           Tommie, pot of tea please dear--
           You're a doll.
           (he puts the phone down)
           She's a doll. Anyways I asked them
           "Girls, what's so funny?" And Diane
           said to me, "Mary Poppins daddy!"
           Well, I had no idea what a Mary
           Poppins was! And then she gave me
           your book. And by gosh!
          He stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his
          point.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           My imagination was caught on fire!
           And I mean ON FIRE! And those
           embers have burned ever since-- as
           you know.

                         

                          PAMELA WALT
          I do. Twenty years!

                         

                          PAMELA WALT
          Yes. Twenty. So you keep I've been asking, asking,

                         SAYING-- ASKING--

                         
          Pamela stops talking and waits for Disney to calm down.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           I got old asking.
          He sits back down on his desk.

                          PAMELA
           What a charming story.

                          WALT
           About my getting old?

                          PAMELA
           About your daughters.

                          WALT
           Yeah I suppose it is.
           (he looks at the picture)
           They're both women now. Gosh! Can
           you believe it?

                          PAMELA
           Children grow up.

                          WALT
           Now Pam, a man can't break a
           promise to his kids. No matter how
           long it takes to keep. No matter
           how long! You might've kept me
           dangling all this time but now we
           gotcha!

                          PAMELA
           Gotcha indeed! Mister Disney, if
           you have dangled then it is at the
           end of a rope you have fashioned
           for yourself.

                          WALT

                          PAMELA--

                          PAMELA
           I was quite clear when you
           approached me the first time that
           she wasn't for sale and clear again
           when you approached me a year later
           and clear again when you approached
           me every annum for the subsequent
           18 years. Honestly, I feel
           corralled, ensnared--

                          WALT
           Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is
           to make you feel--

                          PAMELA
           My name, if you please, is MRS
           Travers.

                          WALT
           You see, I promised them. That's a
           fact. You got kids?

                          PAMELA

                          NOT--

                          WALT

           I have never, I swear, never broken
           a promise to either one of my
           Disney girls.

                          PAMELA
           Well, that's very honourable of you

                          BUT--

                          WALT
           That's what being a daddy is all
           about right?

                          PAMELA

                          (DEEP BREATH)
           Is it?

                          WALT
           This movie isn't just going to make
           my kids happy. It's going to make

           gonna do things with it that are,
           well, are revolutionary.
          He's up again.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           REVOLUTIONARY,Pam!

                          PAMELA

                          OH DEAR--
          Pamela rubs her temples as she watches him fly about the
          room.

                          WALT
           Mary Poppins will literally fly off
           the pages of your books!
          The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt
          gestures for her to bring it to him.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Now imagine! This magical woman who
           has only lived in your head, you'll
           be able to meet her, speak to her,
           hear her sing.
          Tommie places the tray on Walt's desk and leaves the room.
          Walt picks up the tea pot.

                          PAMELA
           Yes, this singing, I am glad you've
           come to that.
           (addressing his tea

                          MAKING)
           Milk first!
          Walt puts the pot down immediately like a scolded child and
          picks up the milk jug, he pours.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           That's right. Now the tea--
          He picks up the pot again and pours the tea.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           And a spoonful of sugar.
          He stirs.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           You don't mean for this film to be
           a musical?

           I absolutely do!
          He presents her with the cup.

                          PAMELA
           No.

                          WALT
           No?

                          PAMELA
           No.
          She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any
          good.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Not bad. No, Mister Disney, Mary
           Poppins does not sing.

                          WALT
           Oh yes she does!

                          PAMELA
           When?

                          WALT
           In your books!

                          PAMELA
           Those aren't songs! They're
           recitations. She is not a giddy
           woman, she does not jig! Singing is
           frivolous and wholly unnecessary
           for a governess, an educatress. No.
           It would just ruin it.
          Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he
          spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs
          loudly. Pamela's jaw drops.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           I won't have her turned into one of
           your silly cartoons.
          Walt takes a sharp breath on `silly' and then plasters the
          smile back on.

                          WALT
           Tell ya what. You just listen to
           what my Sherman boys have come up
           with and if they don't knock your
           socks off then I'm the King of
           England.
          Pamela rolls her eyes.

                          PAMELA
           If you're the King of England then
           you shan't exist and knowing the
           little of you I do; I shouldn't
           think you would like that very
           much.

                          WALT
           Bet you would.
          She smirks, as does he.

           Greensleeves huh?

                          PAMELA
           Come to think of it. That's a song
           I wouldn't object to.

                          WALT

           Yes.
          He's not sure if she's playing with him.

                          WALT
           Pam, I want you to know that the
           last thing I would do, the very
           last thing, is tarnish a story I
           have cherished.
          He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her
          teacup, it's awkward.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

          Pamela is torn between finding Disney captivating and totally
          barking.

                          WALT (CONT'D)

          She extricates her hand.

          She pops the rights document in her bag. Walt's joviality,
          his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second.

                          PAMELA

          She stands up and smooths down her skirt.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

          He holds out his hand for her to shake.

                          WALT

          She leaves his hand hanging in mid air.

           Let's see if that's at all
           possible.
          Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture
          of Disney in a silly hat astride a model train and
          purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face
          that Disney does not see.

          Travers sits, looking out at the dimming sky, playing a
          mournful air on his tin whistle, Ginty curled up in his lap,
          Andrew the dog asleep beside him. Margaret steps out onto the
          veranda an almost imperceptible glance at the half-empty
          bottle at his feet.

                          MARGARET
           It's rather late--
          Travers continues to play.

          Travers takes the pipe from his lips and sighs.

          Margaret strokes her hand over Ginty's hair as the little
          girl slips into the house but hovers unseen by the door,
          watching her parents. Travers pats his knee and Margaret
          perches on it.

                          TRAVERS

          Margaret strokes Travers face and turns her face to the sky.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Pamela sits at a large meeting table as Dolly bustles around
          her placing refreshments. Pamela lays out her pencils one by
          one, makes sure her notebook is `just so.'
          A bowl of fruit is set down upon her notebook and she
          snatches it away, glaring at the table which is now laden
          with every type of snack and beverage imaginable from bagels
          to candy, coffee to soda, there are exotic fruits, enormous
          bouquets of flowers.

           with benefaction from this room
           alone! Ugh, It's so vulgar.
          She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the
          table and plops it on top of Dick's piano. Bob moves it from
          the piano to the floor.

                          BOB

                          (SEETHING)
           That is a very expensive piano.

           And these are beautiful blooms
           butchered for our visual and nasal
           enjoyment when we could have just
           as easily gone to the window,
           looked out and gazed upon them
           happily minding their own business
           and very much still alive.
          Bob hasn't a clue what to say. Pamela smoothes down her skirt
          and re-takes her seat.
          Everybody waits.
          Pamela flicks her eyes at the tape recorder which Don duly
          turns on.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

          She perches her glasses on her nose and raises an eyebrow at
          the cover of her script - "Walt Disney's Mary Poppins."

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

          Don makes the note and is ready to move on but Pamela is
          staring at Dick and Bob. They dutifully pick up their pencils
          and note their scripts too.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Is that on the tape?
          Don glances towards the swirling tape recorder and nods.

                          (EXCITED)
           We made it up!

                          PAMELA
           Well, un-make it up.
          Dick quickly hides the next set of sheet music entitled:

          SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           I've a thought! I've always liked
           Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay. Now, that
           would be a wonderful song for the
           film! Oh! And Admiral Boom could
           sing it! Do you see?
          Dick's fingers crunch the piano keys.

                         

          EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - EVENING

          Pamela's door opens a crack and another half-eaten room
          service meal appears as she kicks it into the hallway. She
          shuts the door quickly behind her.

                         

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

          Pamela lies awake staring at the ceiling.

                          PAMELA
           Irresponstable.

                         

          EXT. FIELD - NEAR GOFF HOUSE - DAY


                         CLOSE ON:
          A tiny park, about half a metre square - it has grass, tiny
          trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a
          pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden
          clothes-peg people. Ginty puts the finishing touches to the
          bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder.
          The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father
          appears, atop his horse.

                          TRAVERS
           Ahhh, there's my girl.
          The horse moves up to her.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           That's it Albert. Give Ginty a
           smooch. There's a good boy, give
           her a little smooch.
          The velvety muzzle of the horse "smooches" Ginty's neck and
          ear as Travers climbs down from the nag.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Poor old Albert; he's your secret
           uncle you know? But a miserable,
           horrid witch turned him into a nag.

                          GINTY
           Why did she do that?!

                          TRAVERS
           Because she hated the sound of his
           laugh.

                          GINTY
           Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix
           him?

                          TRAVERS
           We have to teach the witch how to
           be happy again.

                          GINTY
           How?

                          TRAVERS
           I'm not quite sure darling.

                          (BEAT)
           Your mother's been calling you for
           a good hour. I shouldn't go if I
           were you, she's after little slaves
           for housework!

                          (RECITING YEATS)
           Ah, I must scrub and bake and sweep
           Till stars are beginning to blink

                          AND PEEP;
           And the young lie long and dream in

                          THEIR BED
           Of the matching of ribbons for
           bosom and head.
          Travers sighs, let's the words ring in his ears, touches the
          end of daughter's nose.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Do you want to know what it feels
           like to fly Ginty?
          She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings
          Ginty up so she is facing him.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           You trust me?
          She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over
          his shoulder.
          He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her
          arms.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Gee up, Albert. Yah!
          Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he
          points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Yah!
          Ginty squeals with delight.

                         

          INT. LIMOSINE - MORNING

          Pamela looks out of the window at the palm trees, the empty
          sidewalks. She looks dazed, extremely tired--

                          PAMELA
           Nobody walks.

                          RALPH

                          (SADLY)
           Leisurely stroll's a gift.

                         

          EXT. LAUREL CANYON - MORNING

          The limo floats along the windy canyon roads, cresting the
          top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista.

                          RALPH
           Beautiful ain't it?

                          PAMELA
           (refusing him the

                          SATISFACTION)
           If you like that sort of thing.

                          RALPH
           I do.

          EXT. FIELD - ALLORA - DAY

          Travers and Ginty gallop at great speed. The horse kicking up
          great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance.

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Don DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row
          of storyboard illustrations for the film. Dolly trundles
          along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which
          Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from.

                          DON
           We do find it helps to have a
           visual. It's fun!
          She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house.

                          PAMELA
           No, no, no. Goodness no.

                          DICK
           No?

                          PAMELA
           The Banks house doesn't look like
           that! My house is a terraced house
           with a pink door, white bricked
           with a crack in the gable. The
           window frames are lead-lined and
           the flower boxes grow pink
           nasturtiums to go with the pink

                          DOOR AND--
           (gesturing to the tape

                          RECORDER)
           Did we get that?
           (to herself, slightly

                          HYSTERICAL)
           Oh dear, it's all a big mistake.
           It's all wrong.

                          DON
           It's all wrong?

                          PAMELA
           It's too grand! The Banks family -
           they're normal, everyday sort of
           people. This isn't normal. It isn't
           everyday! They're not aristocrats!

                          DICK
           Interesting.
          Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a
          picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of
          something like recognition on her face and then she simply
          moves on.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)
           Okay.
          She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a
          suffragette ribbon.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (SIGHING)
           Do I even have to say it?

                          DON
           Um-- yeah?

                          PAMELA
           Why in the world have you made Mrs
           Banks a silly suffragette?

                          BOB
           I wonder if Emmeline P would agree
           with that adjective--

                          PAMELA
           Quite possibly, looking back.
          Dick mouths `oh my god!'

                          DON
           It does seem strange that Mrs Banks
           allows her children to spend all of
           their time with the nanny when she
           has no job to speak of--

                          PAMELA
           Are you calling Mrs Banks
           neglectful?

                          BOB
           Yep.

                          DON
           No! Of course not! We just felt
           that if she had a job it would go
           some way to explaining--

                          PAMELA
           Being a mother is a job. A very
           difficult job and one that not
           everybody is up to, that not
           everybody should have taken on in
           the first place!
          The boys see that Pamela is talking about something
          meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief
          moment, until--

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           I will NOT have her called Cynthia!
           Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.
          Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           No it should be something warm, a
           bit sexy.
          They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her
          mouth.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           How about Mavis?

                          DON
           Sybil?

                          BOB
           Sure.

                          PAMELA
           Prudence?

                          DICK
           Gwendolyn?

                          BOB
           Great.

                          PAMELA
           Winifred!

                          DON
           I could go with Winifred.

                          PAMELA
           Yes, that's because it's very good.
          She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of
          it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           This isn't Mr Banks?
          She turns to face Don and the boys.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           This isn't him.

                          DON
           Ahm, yeah, that's him--

                          PAMELA
           He has a set of moustaches!

                          DON
           In the books he--

                          PAMELA
           I told the illustrator I didn't
           like the facial hair but she chose
           to ignore me. This is MY film and
           this time around I shall have MY
           way.

                          DOLLY
           (clearing her throat)
           Mrs Travers, it was a specific
           request, from Walt.
          Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly
          flushes.

                          PAMELA
           (to the boys)
           Why?
          Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is
           clean shaven!
          Bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud,
          unashamed moan.

                          BOB
           Does it mattterrrrrrr?!

                          DON
           Bob, Bob, Bob--
          Pamela stares at Bob.

                          PAMELA
           You can wait outside!
          She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob
          is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           I shan't say it again Robert.
          Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will
          allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear:

           BOB (O.S.)

           KILL ME! KILL ME NOW!

                          PAMELA

                          (TO DICK)
           What is wrong with his leg?

                          DICK
           He got shot.

                          PAMELA
           Hardly surprising.
          Pamela smiles sweetly.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Can I expect anymore drama from
           anyone else?

                         

          INT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

          Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies
          the bar, full of people laughing, exclaiming, enjoying one
          another's company. She takes it in melancholically for a
          second and then jabs the elevator button repeatedly, relieved
          when the doors finally slide open.

                         

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - WASHROOM - ALLORA - MORNING

          Travers faces his reflection in the mirror as Ginty looks on
          from the doorway. He picks up his razor and begins to scrape
          away the stubble.

                          GINTY
           Why do you do that?

                          TRAVERS
           For you my dear!
           (he flicks the blade in
           the air like a swordsman)
           Swish! Which kind of kisses do you
           prefer Gintamina? Swoosh! Scratchy
           ones or silky ones?

                          GINTY

                          (THINKS)
           Silky ones.
           A man must shave for to spare his
           daughter's cheeks! Swish!

                         

          INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - MORNING

          Pamela stares at herself in the clouded bathroom mirror. She
          runs a finger through the steam on the glass.

                          PAMELA
           Swish.
          And again.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Swoosh.

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - DAY

          Dolly, carrying a tray of cakes, stops at the rehearsal room
          door where fractious voices ring out.

           PAMELA (O.S.)
           Stop! Stop! Stop! What on earth are
           you talking about? Supercali--?
           Supercali-- or whatever the
           infernal thing is!

                          DICK
           It's something to say when you
           don't know what to say!

                          PAMELA
           Well I always know what to say.
          The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with
          her foot.

           PAMELA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           If you so much as step one foot in
           here with that tray I shall scream!
           One cannot live on cake alone!

                         

          INT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY

          Dolly stands in Disney's office.

                          DISNEY
           Hit me with it.

                          DOLLY
           She has a lot of-- ideas.

                          DISNEY
           Ya? What kind of ideas?

                          DOLLY
           About how she, uh, sees things.

                          DISNEY
           And just how does she `see' things?
          Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad.

                          DOLLY

                          (READING)
           The name Cynthia has been changed
           to Winifred.

                          WALT
           Okay that'll work.

                          DOLLY
           She won't approve Dick Van Dyke.
          Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too.

                          DOLLY (CONT'D)
           The sketches of the Banks house
           make it look too opulent, there
           must be no hint of romance between
           Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to
           know why Mr Banks has been given a
           moustache, the--

                          WALT
           I asked for that.

                          DOLLY
           Yes. They did tell her but she
           wants to know why.

                          WALT
           Because I asked for it.

                          DOLLY
           Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape
           measure Mary Poppins uses to record
           Jane and Micheal's height must be a
           roll tape, not a ruler, we must add
           gravi-- gravitas, she says.

                          DISNEY
           Gahd! Anything else?

                          DOLLY
           She only wants green vegetables and
           broth, I don't know what that is
           but she wants it in the room from
           now on and oh! She doesn't want the
           colour red in the film-- at all.

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Dick, Don and Pamela sit around the meeting table. Bob hovers
          by the door in a right humph. Disney prefers to stand,
          grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy.

                          PAMELA
           I've simply gone off the colour.
          Their mouths are agape.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           You did say I was to have final say
           did you not?

                          DISNEY
           We can't make the film without the
           colour red! It's set in London for
           pete's sake.

                          PAMELA
           And?

                          DISNEY
           There's buses and mail boxes and
           guards uniforms-- heck! The British
           flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why

                          YOU'RE--

                          PAMELA
           I understand your predicament Mr
           Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don't
           know what it is, I'm just suddenly
           very anti-red. I shan't be wearing
           it ever again.
          Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks
          eyes with her.

                          DISNEY
           Is this a test Pam? Are you
           requiring proof of how badly I
           wanna make you happy so that we can
           create this beautiful thing
           together?
          Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about
          `creating something beautiful' with Walt, but quickly
          recovers and eyeballs him right back.

                          PAMELA
           I took you at your word Mr Disney
           and it seems my first stipulation
           has been denied. There will be many
           more, so-- perhaps we should just
           call it quits and I should hand you
           back these?
          She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it
          to him.
          Disney smiles at Pamela.

                          DISNEY
           Alright. No red in the film.
          Pamela glances at the tape recorder.

                          DON
           What?!

                          DICK
           Walt?
          Don and the Shermans can't believe he has given in! Disney
          strides out of the room.

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Disney marches down the corridor away from the rehearsal
          room. He stops, turns, goes back to the door, puts his hand
          on the handle, stops himself and moves on.

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Dick, Don and Bob are left astounded. They look at one
          another.

                          BOB
           He doesn't have the rights--
          All three turn their heads to turn to her.

                          PAMELA
           Quite.
          Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths
          down her skirt and opens the script.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Now, If you're insisting upon this
           musicality you feel is SO important
           for my film then I suggest I hear
           one of your ditties.
          No one is in the mood to sing for her.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           I shall keep an open mind!

                          DICK
           Nanny?

                          DON
           Yeah, do nanny.
          Dick begins to play--

                          BOB

                          (SPOKEN)
           Wanted a nanny for two adorable
           children.
          Pamela sighs, so do Don and Bob.

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA
          If you want this choice (expecting Dick to stop)
          position, No no! They can't make deman--
          have a cheery disposition--

                         
          But Dick ignores her and carries on.

                          DICK

                          ROSY CHEEKS--

                          BOB PAMELA
          No warts! Who in the world put that
           in?!

                         

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA
          Play games, all sorts! Hm.

                         

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA

          Bob and Don are trying to stop themselves from laughing as
          Dick barrels right over everything Pamela says, almost as if
          the two of them are doing a duet.

           DICK (CONT'D) PAMELA
          Sing songs, bring sweets No sweets!

          INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Walt stands looking out of his window.

                         DISNEY POV:
          Pamela sits on a bench, her feet tucked together, her arms
          clasped around her body, her face to the sky. She sits
          perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out,
          patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her.
          Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello. He opens the
          back door for her and she climbs in.

                          WALT
           Tommie!
          Tommie appears in his office with a glass and hands it to
          Walt.

                          TOMMIE
           Scotch Mist.

                          WALT
           What do you think?

                          TOMMIE
           What do I think I-- what?

                          WALT
           You're a woman.

                          TOMMIE
           That's a canny observation Walt.

                          WALT
           What am I missing?

                          TOMMIE
           You think the female of the species
           has some kind of psychic insight
           when it comes to others of her
           kind?
          Walt continues to stare out of the window.

                          TOMMIE (CONT'D)
           We don't.

                          (BEAT)
           You'll get yourself an ulcer with
           all that unriddling. Give it up.
          Tommie waits for a response but he's still window bound,
          filled with intrigue as he watches the car disappear.

                          WALT

                          (UNDER)

          INT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

          Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies
          the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. The
          elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar
          instead.

                          BARMAN
           Good afternoon Ma'am. What can I
           fix you?

                          PAMELA
           A pot of tea.

                          BARMAN
           Sure thing.
          Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all
          glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs
          Travers.
          The tea pot arrives.

                          PAMELA
           Thank you. Tea is a balm for the
           soul don't you agree?
          But the barman has already moved on to another patron.
          Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come
          and go. The barman talks with another customer further along
          the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks
          like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring
          into her empty cup.

                         

          EXT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - DAY

          Ginty - in a rather tattered school uniform - is diminutive
          in front of the huge double doors to the bank. An upright,
          top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank open
          chivalrously for her.

                         

          INT. BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS

          Ginty and the man enter the bank.

                          GINTY
           Thank you.
          A bank worker tips his hat to the gentleman.

                          BANK WORKER
           Good afternoon Mr Belhatchett.
          Cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously.
          Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a
          loud crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers'
          office. The etching on the glass reads:

          TRAVERS GOFF - BANK MANAGER

                         

          INT. TRAVERS OFFICE - DAY

          Travers has just dropped (purposefully) a tray of coins on
          the floor. He has a wild edge to him, he may well have been
          drinking.

                          TRAVERS

                          (TO CLERK)
           Belhatchett. Bell. Hatchett. Ha!
           It's a ridiculous moniker!

                          CLERK

                          SIR--

                          TRAVERS
           And Mr Belhatchett has complained
           that I opened his stupid bank five
           minutes late has he? Hahaaa!
           (in a comedy voice)
           Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's
           money my man!
          The clerk laughs nervously.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Bell Hatchett! Beautiful hatchet.
           That's what it means. And I suppose
           if the poor dumb lambs on his
           downs, are five minutes late with
           their calving, or they don't drop
           dead on schedule when he wants a
           roast, he takes to them with the
           business end of his beautiful
           hatchet.
          Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing
          piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           There, whack! That'll teach you for
           not dropping your bairns on
           schedule. Whack! Whack! Whack!
          Travers looks at the figure standing outside his door and his
          eyes widen.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Whack. Whoops!
           (through the door)
           Mr Belhatchett! Allow me to--
          Travers pushes the door open to reveal Ginty at his side and
          is felled.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Ginty!

                          RANDOLPH
           I want you gone.
          All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to
          have forgotten. Travers is overcome with embarrassment and
          guilt.

                          TRAVERS
           Sweet thing! What are you doing
           here?
          Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.

                          GINTY
           You said today was--

                          TRAVERS
           Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What
           kind of father am I?

                          GINTY

                          (SCARED)
           Are you fired again?

                          TRAVERS
           Ah, yes it does seem that--

                          RANDOLPH

                          (TO GINTY)
           No. No sweetheart-- he isn't.

                          TRAVERS

                          (TO GINTY)
           Just wait in my office for a second
           darling.
          Randolph walks away, stopping to whisper in Travers ear.

                          RANDOLPH
           If you can't straighten up for your
           own sake. Do it for your daughter.
           (muttering to himself)
           Irresponsible.
          Travers holds out his arms to Ginty and she runs into them.

                          TRAVERS
           Ice cream is so rare because it
           only comes from Siberian cows. Did
           you know that?!

                          (BEAT)
           Brrrrrrrr!

                         

          EXT. RIVER - ALLORA - DAY

          Ginty and Travers sit by the river. Ginty eats an enormous
          ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask.

                          TRAVERS
           We share a Celtic soul, you and I.
           This world is just an illusion,
           Ginty old girl. As long as we hold
           that thought dear, they can't break
           us. Money, money, money. Don't you
           buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you
           on the bot!
           How did we end up here eh? Look at
           it. Barren. Breathless.
           Get as far away from this place as
           possible my love. Find yourself a
           patch of green.

                          (HE SIGHS)
           It's a chimera you know? The world,
           the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-
           whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an
           illusion.
          He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep
          melancholy. Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound
          unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.

          EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Another untouched meal in the hallway.

                         

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Pamela lies in the dark, the phone pressed to her ear.

                          PAMELA

                          (INTO PHONE)
           I loathe this place, Mr Russell.
           How can a place so sunny be so
           cold?
          We don't hear what Diarmuid says.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           I meant heartless. I'm afraid a
           jumper wouldn't suffice. It's
           bringing up these-- it's so hot and
           stuffy I feel like I am being
           attacked. These odd dreams, like my
           subconscious is after me. Punishing
           me for entertaining the idea that I
           might hand her over. I am at war
           with myself Mr Russell.

                          (BEAT)
           The script is ghastly, exactly as I

                          EXPECTED--

                          (BEAT)
           Yes, a few more days and then I'll

                          DECIDE--

                          (BEAT)
           I know, I know I need the money.
           The money. The money.

                          (TO HERSELF)
           Money. It'll bite you on the--

                          (INTO PHONE)
           It's all an illusion you know Mr
           Russell? All an illusion.

                          (BEAT)
           Very well. Good morning and
           goodnight.
          She hangs up the phone, and continues sitting upright. Wide
          awake. Staring into the darkness.
          Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for
          something to help her. Nothing. She groans as she drags
          herself out of bed, pacing the room, counting steps.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Serves me right. Money, money,
           money. Bit me on the bot.
          Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the
          bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto
          the stuffed toy for comfort.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING

          The room is decidedly more lively, with sketches of the cast
          and models of the sets all about the place. And of course,
          the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now
          accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a
          fluorescent looking soup.
          Bob and Dick are at the piano. Don sits in the corner,
          sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a
          cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers.

                          DICK
           It's gotta be like a slogan!

                          BOB
           Her prescription for life.

                          DICK
           Yeah! Yes! A stitch in time!

                          BOB
           An apple a day.

                          DON
           (from across the room)
           Time and tide wait for--

                          BOB
           Sugar!

                          DICK
           Sugar?

                          DICK (CONT'D)
           What? That's not--

                          BOB
           Jeff had vaccination day at school
           yesterday.

                          DICK
           Ouch.

                          BOB
           No ouch.

                          DICK
           No ouch?

                          BOB
           Sugar. They put it in a cube.

                          DICK
           Medicine in sugar?

                          BOB
           Cube's an odd word.

                          BOB (CONT'D)
           Spoonful?
          Dick throws his hands and legs in the air almost falling off
          his stool!

                          DON

                          (UNDER)
           Yeah, we have sugar.

                         

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - MORNING

          Pamela steps from the car and Walt is there to greet her.

                          WALT
           May I walk with you?

                          PAMELA
           I'm sure your country doesn't have
           any laws about sharing a pavement.
          As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the
          rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING

          Dick is playing about with a verse.

                          BOB
           Go back to the chorus.

                          DICK & BOB
           (singing it incorrectly)
           Just a spoonful of sugar helps the
           medicine go down!

                          BOB
           Wait! WAIT! She always does what's
           unexpected.
           She goes UP the bannisters.
          Dick is confused.

                          BOB (CONT'D)
           So go up.
          Dick plays a high note.

                          BOB (CONT'D)
           Try B.
          He takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks Dick's sheet
          music. Dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano

                          DICK & BOB
           (singing `down' in an up

                          KEY)
           Just a spoonful of sugar helps the
           medicine go down.
          Don looks up from his sketching.

                          DICK
           Yes!
          The sound of Walt's cough signals his imminent arrival.

                          DON
           Man is in the forest.
          Pamela and Walt enter the room.

                          DON (CONT'D)

                          (TO WALT)
           I want you to hear this.
           (to the boys)
           Play him what you got.
          Walt takes a seat beside the piano. Pamela folds her arms
          across her chest defiantly.

                          DICK
           It's just a chorus--

                          BOB
           Tell us what you think.
           He knows dum dum
           Will help dum dum dum duuuum!
          Bob whistles what will end up being the Robin's part of the
          song.

                          DICK

                          (SINGING)
           Just a spoonful of sugar helps the
           medicine go down--
           the medicine go do-own,
           medicine go down
           Just a spoonful of sugar
           helps the medicine go down
           In a most de da dee daaa!

                          BOB
           We'll work out the other lyrics.

                          DICK
           You see how it goes up on the word
           down?

                          BOB
           On the word down it goes up!

                          PAMELA

                          (UNHAPPY)
           Up.

                          DON
           It's ironic.

                          PAMELA
           Is it?

                          WALT
           Forget ironic, it's iconic.
          Pamela rolls her eyes.

                          PAMELA

                          (SARCASTIC)
           Bravo.

                          WALT
           I won't be able to stop singing
           that for weeks!

                          PAMELA
           It seems enormously patronising to
           me. The very sort of annoying tune
           you would have playing in your
           themed park I daresay. All giddy
           and carefree, encouraging children
           to face the world unarmed. All they
           need is a spoon and some sugar and
           a brain full of fluff and they're
           equipped with life's tools.
           Wonderful!
          Dick is completely deflated.

                          WALT
           What's your point Pam?

                          PAMELA
           MRS Travers! My point is that,
           unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is
           the very enemy of sentiment and
           whimsy. She is truthful, she
           doesn't sugar coat the darkness in
           the world that these children will
           eventually come to know. She
           prepares them for it, she deals in
           honesty. One must clean one's room;
           it won't magically do it itself!
          She waves the script in the air.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           This whole script is flim flam!
           Where is its reality? Where is its
           heart, where is the gravitas?
          She opens a window and flings the script out.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           No weight Mister Disney! See?
          Dick, Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages flutter
          downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot.

                          WALT
           No whimsy or sentiment says the
           woman who sends a flying nanny with
           a talking umbrella to save the
           children.

                          PAMELA
           You think Mary Poppins is saving
           the children Mr Disney?
          Pamela sighs, shakes her head.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Oh dear.

                         

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - LATE AFTERNOON

          Pamela makes her way to the bench she waits on for Ralph.
          She sits down, wraps her arms around herself, closes her
          eyes.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)
           It goes up.

                         

          EXT. BACK PADDOCK - ALLORA - DAY

          Margaret sweats as she hangs out laundry whilst desperately
          shushing her screaming infant.

                          MARGARET
           There there. Shush shush now--
          Ginty and Biddy run in and out of the sheets, chasing a large
          hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the
          girls.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
           (to the girls)
           If you could just--

                          TRAVERS

                          (CALLING)
           Ahoy Goffs!
          The girls and Margaret look up, surprised to see Travers so
          early.

                          GINTY
           Father!
          She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one
          arm, catching Biddy with the other.

                          MARGARET
           What a lovely surprise! Did you
           finish early?

                          TRAVERS
           I couldn't stop thinking about my
           beautiful girls on this beautiful
           day in this beautiful place and I
           thought to hell with it!
           (to Ginty and Biddy)
           And what do we say about beauty
           ladies?

           GINTY/BIDDY/TRAVERS
           A thing of beauty is a joy forever!

                          MARGARET

                          BUT--

                          TRAVERS
           Buts are for goats my love!
          He dips her and smooches her.

                          GINTY & BIDDY
           Urgh!

                          TRAVERS
           (whispering to Margaret)
           I'll put in extra hours tomorrow.

                          (TO GINTY)
           What are we playing?

                          GINTY
           The hen got out and we've been
           trying to catch her!
          Travers spies the clucking demon.

                          TRAVERS
           That's no hen! That's Aunt Ellie,
           your mother's horrendiferous
           sister!

                          GINTY

                          (LAUGHING)
           That's a made up word!

                          BIDDY
           Really?!

                          GINTY
           Not the aunt!

                          (BEAT)
           Quick! Catch her before she flies
           away on the--

                          TRAVERS/GINTY
           East Wind!
          Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase
          the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them
          into the ground.

                          MARGARET
           Oh!

                          TRAVERS
           I'll wash them again my love!
          Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs.
          The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the
          poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in,
          Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a
          whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it
          back inside - out of sight, out of mind.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast!
          Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and
          scarpers. It's chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the
          evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other,
          cursing and laughing.

                          GINTY
           Aunt Ellie!

           Oh she's a foul fowl!

                         

          INT. TRAVER'S BEDROOM/CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          Biddy and Moya sleep but Ginty is awake, the hen snuggled
          firmly under her arm. She can hear the tense voices of her
          parents.

                          MARGARET
           --darling, it's just that um-- a

                          LITTLE CONCERNED--

                          TRAVERS
           --Meg sweet, I had a throat scratch-

                          -

                          MARGARET
           --the bank is getting you down
           again? Perhaps my sister--

                          TRAVERS
           God no! No. I can endure. I will
           endure. For the girl's sake-- Just,
           please-- not Ellie.

                          MARGARET
           Oh my dear--
          Travers weeps and Ginty closes her eyes, buries her little
          face in the hens feathers.

                          GINTY

                          (WHISPERING)
           Foul fowl.

                         

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

          Pamela sits up in bed - leaning back into the open arms of
          Mickey Mouse - applying face cream, then hand cream, her face
          is screwed into a twist of unhappiness.

                         

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - NIGHT

          Disney sits on Pamela's bench, deep in contemplation.
          Piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and then a

                         VOICE--

                          DICK
           All around the cathedral
           the saints and apostles
           look down as she sells her wares
          Walt is dragged from his thoughts and gets up to follow the
          sound.

                          DICK (CONT'D)
           Although you can't see it
           you know they are smiling
           Each time someone shows that he

                          CARES--

                         

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK

          Walt walks towards the music room, visibly moved by the song,
          a cough rattling in his throat.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - NIGHT

          Also in lamplight, Dick Sherman sits at his piano. Bob asleep
          on a couch in the corner. Walt pushes the door open, Dick
          knows he's there but keeps tinkling away.

                          DICK
           Though her words are simple and few
           listen, listen, she's calling to

                          YOU--
           "Feed the birds, tuppence a bag
           tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a
           bag."

                          WALT
           That'll work.
          Dick nods, still playing. Walt makes his way to the piano,
          sighs, sits next to Dick on the stool.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           She's going to say no isn't she?

                          (BEAT)
           Woman's a conundrum.
          Dick stops playing and flicks to a new page of sheet music.

                          DICK
           A man has dreams of walking with

                          GIANTS
           To carve his niche in the edifice

                          OF TIME

                          (SINGING)
           Before the mortar of his zeal
           Has a chance to congeal
           The cup is dashed from his lips
           The flame is snuffed aborning
           He's brought to rack and ruin in

                          HIS PRIME--
          Walt laughs out loud, he sings with Dick reading the lyrics
          from the music sheet.

                          WALT & DICK
           My world was calm, well ordered,

                          EXEMPLARY
           Then came this person, with chaos
           in her wake
           And now my life's ambitions go with
           one fell blow
           It's quite a bitter pill to take.

                          WALT
           Inspired by someone we know?

                          DICK

                          (FEIGNING INNOCENCE)
           You'd have to ask Bob.
          The men smile, bittersweet.

                          DICK (CONT'D)
           She might surprise us all.

                          WALT
           She won't.

                          DICK
           You don't know that.

                          WALT
           I do. I know it, I know it only too
           well.

                          (BEAT)
           I've fought this battle from her
           side. Pat Powers, he wanted the
           mouse and I didn't have a bean back
           then.
          Dick raises his eyebrows.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           He was this big terrifying New York
           producer and I was just a kid from
           Missouri with a sketch of Mickey
           but-- it woulda' killed me to give
           him up.
          Walt peers down at the sleeping Bob.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Honest to god killed me. That
           mouse, he's family.

                          (BEAT)
           Go home.
          Walt leaves the room.

                         

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - NIGHT

          Pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at
          the stars. The pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the
          water making it look like a chalk painting.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)
           The world is an illusion Ginty.

                         

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - LATE AFTERNOON

          Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped
          around her body, face to the sky.
          The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last
          deafening chorus of the birds.
          Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit
          jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His
          shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of
          something close to despair.
          He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and
          immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of
          greeting.

                          TRAVERS
           Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick!
           Pray tell me, what are you
           concentrating so hard on?

                          GINTY
           I am laying eggs!

                          TRAVERS
           Really!? Fabulous!

                          GINTY
           Today I am a hen.

                          TRAVERS
           Indeed! I can see the feathers
           sprouting as we speak!
          Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her
          husband and knows he is drunk.

                          MARGARET
           Helen Goff, would you lay the table
           for supper please?

                          GINTY
           I'm not Helen!

                          TRAVERS

                          (OVER)
           She can't possibly lay a table;
           she's busy laying eggs!

                          MARGARET
           I need-- (help.)

                          TRAVERS
           She's laying!

                          MARGARET
           (her face contorts in

                          PAIN)
           I'm sorry!
          She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty
          gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm.
          He swallows hard, eyes welling.

                          TRAVERS
           (urgent, his voice

                          BREAKING)
           Don't you ever stop dreaming Ginty
           my love. You can be anyone you want
           to be. Anyone.

                          GINTY
           I want to be like you.

                          TRAVERS
           Don't.

                          (HE CHOKES)
           Don't leave yourself always
           searching for-- something--
          He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the
          porch.
          Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around
          to the side of the house where she watches her father appears
          in the window of the washroom. She doesn't know what to do as
          he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing.

                         

                         

                         OMITTED

                         

          INT. LIMO - MORNING

          Ralph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the
          steely fight flown away on the East wind. Her arms wrapped
          around her chest, her face turned to the window.

                          RALPH
           Ya alright Mrs?
          Pamela doesn't even hear him.

                         

          INT. ALLORA SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

          Ginty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush
          in her hand, dripping colour down her arm.
          She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY.

                          MRS CORRY
           Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want
           your banner to be ready for the
           fair don't you?
          Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads:

                         ALLORA FAIR
          Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with
          stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its
          bridal.

                         

          INT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

          Margaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground. Tents are
          erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks
          of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white
          horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal.

                          BIDDY
           Mrs Brill said Father's presenting
           the medals.

                          MARGARET
           (a flutter of pride)
           He is indeed! On behalf of the
           bank.

                         

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING

          Pamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on
          what's going on in the room.

                          DON
           Mrs Travers?
          Again, she doesn't hear.

                          DON (CONT'D)
           Mrs Travers?
          Pamela looks at Don.

                          DON (CONT'D)
           We were just saying that we'd like
           to play you the song in the bank.

                          (BEAT)
           Would that be good?
          Pamela nods, noncommittal.

                          DON (CONT'D)
           (as Dawes Snr)
           So you have tuppence? May I be
           permitted to see it?
           (changing voice to Michael

                          BANKS)
           No, I want it to feed the birds!
           (back to Dawes Snr)
           Fiddlesticks boy! Feed the birds
           and what've you got?

           DON/DICK/BOB
           Fat birds!

                          DICK
           (singing more sotto than

                          USUAL)
           But! If you invest your tuppence
           wisely in the bank

                         

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY


           DICK (V.O.)
           Safe and sound--
          A small stage and dais stand central of the event over which
          a large sign reads:

           SPONSORED BY THE BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA

           DICK (V.O.)
           Soon that tuppence safely invested
           in the bank will compound--
          The Allora townsfolk are out in force. Ginty walks with her
          family. Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as
          they pass through the crowds.

           DICK (V.O.)
           And you'll achieve that sense of

                          CONQUEST--
          Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family
          walk past.

                          TRAVERS
           (clears his throat)
           Mr Belhatchett.
          Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his
          family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this.

           DICK (V.O.)
           As your affluence expands--
          Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them
          to Ginty and Biddy.

                          MARGARET
           Travers, Biddy's stomach--

                          TRAVERS
           Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop
           whinnying like an old nag will you?
          Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but
          she keep her mouth shut.
          Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments
          tent.

                          GINTY

                          (PANICKED)
           Father-- will you ride the carousel
           with me!?
          But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip.

                          TRAVERS
           Meet you there in a blink of an
           eye!

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          As before.

                          DICK

                          (SINGING)
           In the hands of the directors
           who invest as propriety demands.

                         

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

          Ginty stands with her family at the carousel, eyeing the
          refreshment tent.

                          MARGARET

                          (TO GINTY)
           I'll take Biddy to get ready for
           her dance.

                          (BEAT)
           Where's your father?
          Margaret sees the direction of Ginty's gaze. Her face falls
          but she takes Biddy by the hand and heads for the stage.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
           Come on Biddy.

                         

          INT. REFRESHMENT TENT - DAY

          Ginty appears in the tent's entrance. On first glance she
          sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers. Relief
          begins to dawn and she turns away.
          It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to
          see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre.

                          TRAVERS
           Indeed, a published poet--
          She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers
          hand.

                          GINTY
           Father, come and look. Biddy's
           dancing.

                          TRAVERS
           In a moment, my princess. I'm
           talking.

                          (BEAT)
           Back in Ireland, I miss her green

                          HILLS SO--

                          GINTY
           But she's-- she really wants you to
           watch, Dad. You'll miss it.

           Not now Biddy!

                          GINTY
           I'm Ginty.

                          TRAVERS
           Ginty! Shoo!
          Devastated, Ginty doesn't know what to do, she pulls at his
          shirt sleeve again.

                          GINTY
           You said don't give up.
          A waiter approaches and takes her by the arm, leading her
          away.

                          WAITER
           Excuse me, Miss. It's gentlemen
           only in this section of the tent.
           I think you'll be more comfortable
           at the far end.

                          (BEAT)
           Are you alright sweetheart?

                          GINTY

                          (TO WAITER)
           I'm scared my father is--
          Despairing she looks up and sees her mother, carrying Moya,
          in the entrance. Her mother's face falls and crumples.

                         

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS

          Travers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the
          dais, and finds his way to the speaker's podium. Margaret
          and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware.

                          TRAVERS
           Good afternoon, distinguished
           guests, our biggest supporter Mr
           Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely
           wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys
           and girls!
          Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of
          the bank staff.

                          RANDOLPH
           Why is he speaking for the bank?

                          BANK WORKER
           He's the manager.

                          TRAVERS
           I'm honoured to be here on behalf
           of the Belhatchett Bank of
           Australia. Shortly, it will be my
           very pleasant duty to present the
           awards to our young performers. But
           before I begin, I'd like to say a
           very few words to our very youngest
           citizens about the role of the -
           er, the Bank in our community.
          Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good.

                          MARGARET
           He's using too many `verys'. He
           always says `very' too much when

                          HE'S--
          She can't say it. Ginty takes her mother's hand but Margaret
          pushes the hand away.

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Pamela turns away from Don and the Shermans and takes herself
          to look at a sketch of Mr Banks, pinned to the wall, he still
          has a moustache.

          EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - CONTINUOUS

          There's a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged,
          Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful.
          But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs
          the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front
          of the dais.

                          TRAVERS
           Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking
           you. Now-- what, what am I doing
           next? Oh! It's a marvellous idea to
           encourage children to open
           accounts. My daughter, the Princess
           Ginty-- she's-- uh.
           (looks at Ginty)
           How old are you? Come up here.
          Ginty - what? Me?
          Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs,
          makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais.
          Margaret watches, growing uneasy.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Ginty has a bank account-- and
           that's good. Give her a drink!
          The audience is shocked.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

                          (MUMBLING)
           I mean give her a hand.
          Everyone is beginning to look uncomfortable.

           I shall return in just a moment to
           present the awards. But right now I
           must-- relieve myself.
          Gasps from the audience.
          Margaret - dying.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will
           you? I'm busting. There's a good
           girl.
          Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage,
          Travers leaning on Ginty's shoulder. The shameful glare of
          Allora burning into them.

           DON (O.S.)
           When fall the banks of England,
           England falls!
          Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps
          and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap
          as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly
          injury, Travers cannot stop laughing.

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The boys are laughing, congratulating one another.

          Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins
          around viciously.

                          PAMELA
           Why did you have to make him so
           cruel?
          The boys jubilance is halted immediately.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           He was not a monster!

                          PAMELA
           And do those children write you
           letters, make drawings for you?

                          DON
           Of course.

           And would you tear up those gifts?
           In front of them?!
          Silence. They know where this is going.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           It's a dreadful thing to do! I
           don't understand! Why must father
           tear up the advertisement his
           children have written and throw it
           in the fireplace!? Why won't he
           mend their kite? Why have you made
           him so unspeakably awful?

                          (BEAT)
           For all the world to see, in
           glorious technicolor? You claim to
           make them live-- if that happens
           can't he? Can't they at least live
           well?
          Pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           I can't bear it.

                          (SOFTLY)

                          PLEASE DON'T--
          The boys are shocked at the level of upset.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Please don't-- I'll feel like I let
           him down again--
          She leaves the room, head hung.

                         

          INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Travers is in bed, his leg elevated and set with plaster. He
          is shaking badly with DT's, his mood is poisonous.
          Ginty sits on the edge of the bed as the DOCTOR packs up his
          bag.

                          TRAVERS
           I don't suppose there's any more
           you can give me for the pain?
          The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more.

                          DOCTOR
           (leaving the room)
           When will enough be enough Travers?

                          GINTY
           I've brought you something father.

                          TRAVERS
           Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help
           father out won't you?
          Ginty is wary.

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           In my washroom-- there's a bottle
           of medicine that father needs--

                          GINTY
           Mother took it away.
          Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty.

                          TRAVERS
           Godammit!
          Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper
          from her pocket.

                          GINTY
           I wrote a poem for you. It - it
           won first prize, at school.
          Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his
          shaking hand.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)
           Would you like me to read it to
           you?
          The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand. Finally, the
          humiliation is too much for Travers. He scans the page
          rapidly and lowers his hand.

                          TRAVERS
           It's hardly Yeats, is it?
          Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening
          in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far
          she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela
          to come.

                         

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela rushes from the rehearsal room, down the corridor, her
          face twisted, desperately trying to maintain composure. Don
          rushes out after her.

                          DON
           Mrs Travers!
          He stops, recognizing she doesn't need to be followed.

          INT. KITCHEN - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets, drawers, the trash
          but doesn't find what she's looking for.

                         

          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the
          lot, past Ralph - who's taking his lunch at the cafeteria -
          and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of
          a soundstage.

                         

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun
          as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what
          it is she's looking for.

                         

          EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into
          the dirt and lawn.

                         

          INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty creeps into her father's room, he sleeps fitfully, and
          presses the half-full bottle into his hand. Covering both
          hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room.

                         

          EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

          Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in
          the grass.

                          RALPH
           Mrs?
          Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she's not
          crying.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)
           I, uh, brought you a tea.
          He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.

                          PAMELA
           It's blasphemy to drink tea from a
           paper cup.
          Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite
          sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.
          Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits
          and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the
          area around her.

                          RALPH
           Everything okay Ma'am? Would you
           like me to drive you home?

                          PAMELA
           All the way to England? Yes,
           please.
          Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.

                          RALPH
           You got family back there Mrs?

                          PAMELA
           You're an impertinent man you know?
           You ask an awful lot of questions
           that have no relevance to you being
           able to carry out your duties.

                          RALPH

                          (LAUGHING)
           I know! I do, do that. Yes!

                          PAMELA
           And you have no barometer.
          Ralph is confused.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Let us say that I haven't family
           who'd notice whether I was halfway
           across the world or sitting in my
           living room.
          She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs
          together.

                          RALPH

                          MA'AM; I--
          Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he
          looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a
          small line through the grass then hands it to him.

                          PAMELA
           Make a little furrow, there.
          Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder
          for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.
          Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.

                          RALPH
           I gotta kid.

                          PAMELA
           Well, most people do.

                          RALPH
           Jane-- she's got all kinds of
           troubles.
          Pamela raises an eyebrow.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)
           Handicapped you know? Myelitis-- 
           transverse.

                          (BEAT)
           She's in a wheelchair see? That's
           why I concern myself with the
           weather-- sunny day she can sit out
           in the garden. Rainy day I have to
           leave her cooped up inside.

                          (BEAT)
           Worry `bout the future, but then I
           stop cuz you can't do that. Only
           today.
          Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes
          holes in it.

                          PAMELA
           Now look.
          She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes
          and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of
          Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig
          struts forming a roof.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           It's a band stand.
          She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid
          into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park.

                          RALPH
           A river!

                          PAMELA

                          (CORRECTING HIM)
           Lake.

                          RALPH
           Lake.

                          (BEAT)
           Hey! I wish I could take her there!
          He points at the miniature park.

                          PAMELA
           Wouldn't that be nice?

          INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem
          to her chest.
          The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows
          looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she
          seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes. There's
          just nothing there--

                          MARGARET

                          (WHISPERING)
           I know you gave it to him.
           (squeezing Ginty's hand)
           All the hope is in the bottom of
           that bottle, Helen.

                          GINTY
           Mother?

                          MARGARET
           I want you to take care of the
           children.
          Ginty is groggy, she doesn't understand.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
           Watch over them.
          Ginty sits up.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
           I know you love your father more.
           But one day you'll understand.

                          GINTY
           What?
          Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed
          following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is
          crying.

                         

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT

          Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in
          her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden
          like some ethereal ghost.

                          GINTY
           Mother!
          She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.

           BIDDY (O.S.)
           Ginty!
          Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her
          mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness.

                          GINTY

                          (CALLING)
           Mother! Mother!
          The baby is screaming now.

                         

          INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in
          it, she scoops Moya up from the crib.

                          BIDDY
           Where's ma?

                          GINTY
           Once upon a time there were three
           little girls alone in a house.
           They were frightened of the big
           wide world just outside the door.
          She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily
          outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar
          and he looks incredibly frail and delirious.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)
           They were so afraid.
          She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting
          her mother to be standing there any minute but there is
          nothing.

                         

          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT

          The mud-stained hem of Margaret's nightdress sweeps along the
          ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of
          the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her
          ankles, soaking the nightgown.

           GINTY (V.O.)
           But the stars were guarding them,
           they glittered as they spoke "We
           shall send a guide to show them the
           way to the magical ladder which
           will bring them all the way up to

                          SEE US"

                         

          EXT. LIVING ROOM - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT

          Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front
          of the fireplace.

                          GINTY
           And who do you think those
           sparkling messengers sent? Who was
           it that came flying through the
           starry, starry sky to carry us up
           to see them?
          Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy's arms.

                          BIDDY
           An elf?

                         

          EXT. PORCH - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence still speaking to
          the girls through the window.

                          GINTY
           Their old Uncle Albert of course!
           (beat, to Biddy)
           Stay right here, be good--
          Ginty climbs atop the horse.

                          BIDDY
           Are you going to the sky?

                          GINTY
           I'm going to find the end of the
           story so I can bring it back for
           you!

                          BIDDY
           Is it happy?

                         

          EXT. PADDOCK - NIGHT

          Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her
          mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp
          still burns on the porch.

                         

          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT

          Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the
          creek. Shivering cold. She wills herself forward into the
          water. She wants to sink down and simply float away.
          From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret
          turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty.
          Margaret begins to weep.
          Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother,
          wading into the water to grab hold of her.
          Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep
          water.

                          MARGARET
           Sometimes a person we love, through
           no fault of his own, can't see past
           the end of his nose.

                          GINTY
           It's time to go home, ma.
          She reaches out her hand--

                         

                         OMITTED

                         

          INT. SUITE - EVENING

          Pamela looks through a stack of books intently, jotting
          something down on a piece Beverly Hills Hotel stationery
          every now and then.
          Presently, the phone rings. Pamela almost jumps out of her
          skin. She rushes to grab it.

                          PAMELA

                          (INTO PHONE)
           Mrs Travers! Hello!

                         

          INT. DISNEY'S OFFICE - BURBANK - EVENING.

          Walt sits at his desk, flicking through cartoon drawings of
          penguins.

                          WALT
           (coughs into phone)
           Pam!

          INTERCUT BETWEEN PHONE CALLS AS NECESSARY.

                          PAMELA

                          (DISAPPOINTED)
           Mr Disney.

                          WALT
           Callin' to check up on you.

                          PAMELA
           Are you a doctor?

                          WALT
           Hm?

                          PAMELA
           Check ups are for medical
           practitioners no?

                          WALT
           Pam, are you always so battle
           ready? P.L. Travers in her breast
           plate and chain mail, sword up in
           the air and off with your head!

                          PAMELA
           What can I do for you Mister
           Disney?

                          WALT
           Please, I beg of you, please please
           call me Walt.

                          PAMELA
           Walt-- er.

                          WALT
           I heard things didn't go so well
           today.

                          PAMELA
           They went as well as they've gone
           every other day that I've been
           here. I don't recall `special'
           phone calls from you on any of
           those other evenings.

                          WALT
           What's this all about Pam? Really?
          Silence.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           I'm wondering what I have to do to
           make you happy.

                          PAMELA
           Ha!

                          WALT
           Aren't you wondering that too?
          Silence.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           (he has an idea)
           You know, you've never been to
           Disneyland! It's the happiest place
           on Earth!
           (shouting away from the

                          PHONE)
           Tommie! Cancel my morning tomorrow.
           I'm taking a ride with my favorite
           author!

                          (INTO PHONE)
           Any excuse.

                          PAMELA
           I cannot tell you how uninterested,
           no, positively sickened I am at the
           thought of going to see your dollar
           printing machine Mr-- Walter.
          She notices Mickey's innocent eyes staring at her and gently
          turns his face away.

                          WALT
           Oh come on! When does anybody get
           to go to Disneyland with Walt
           Disney himself?!

                          PAMELA
           Disappointments are to the soul
           what the thunderstorm is to the
           air.
          Walt slams the phone down. Pamela stares at it in shock!

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Hello? Hello? He hung up! I'm! I! I
           can't believe he hung up!
          Walt leans back in his chair and grins, Tommie enters.

                          WALT
           I'm not a violent man Tommie but if
           Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by
           a large truck I--
           (he doesn't allow himself

                          TO FINISH)

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Dick, Bob and Don are drained. They stare at each other in
          silence. Just the look tells us how much this all means to
          them. It's desperate. Walt flings the door to the room open.

                          WALT
           Okay boys. We gotta fix this.

                         

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - TRAVERS BEDROOM - ALLORA - MORNING

          Ginty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in
          his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge.
          The sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence.

           MARGARET (O.S.)
           Oh my!
          And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell.

           AUNT ELLIE (O.S.)
           Margaret, my poor child. I simply
           had to come. We must fix this.
          Travers eyes spring wide open in horror.

                          TRAVERS
           The Aunt.

                         

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - MORNING

          A parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair.
          An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries -
          plonked on the living room table and there beside it,
          upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair
          scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket -
          a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same.
          Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an
          endless supply of belongings from her bag.

                          ELLIE
           Now, I've brought every new fangled
           treatment available in Sydney.
          Biddy is open mouthed.

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)
           Close your mouth please Biddy, we
           are not a codfish.
           (to both girls)
           I spy a multitude of jobs to be
           done!

                          MARGARET
           They've been so worried-- I've--

                          ELLIE
           Do stop babbling nonsense! I'm here
           now and I shall fix everything.

                          (BEAT)
           Girls!

                          (BEAT)
           Feverfew and camomile to lower his
           body temperature. Garlic, sorrel,
           sage. Deadly nightshade. And if
           those don't work-- well I shouldn't
           like to say.
          Young Pamela and Biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance
          as item after item emerges from the carpetbag.

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)
           --tincture of horseradish--

                          LAUDANUM--
           (to Ginty and Biddy)

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)
           I thought I had made it quite clear
           you were to begin helping.
          Ellie claps her hands together.

                          ELLIE (CONT'D)
           Spit spot!

                         

          INT. LIMOSINE - MORNING

          Ralph drives along solemnly. Pamela looks out of the window,
          confused.

                          PAMELA
           Where are we--? This isn't the way.

                          RALPH
           Change of venue this morning
           apparently.

                          PAMELA
           (realizing where she's

                          BEING TAKEN)
           Ugh.

                          RALPH
           I was thinking about our-- tea
           party?

                          PAMELA
           I'm sure I don't know what you're--

                          RALPH

                          (OVER)
           Yesterday, the little park.

                          PAMELA
           Little park? I haven't a clue what
           you're talking about.

                          RALPH

                          BUT--

                          PAMELA
           Concentrate on the road. Always
           chitter chattering!

                         

          EXT. DISNEYLAND ENTRANCE - DAY

          Ralph drives Pamela up to the entrance to the park. Two
          security guards stop the car briefly and then the gates pull
          open to reveal Walt Disney waiting for Pamela.

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Ralph is goggle-eyed at seeing Walt.

                          RALPH
           Oh! Isn't that nice? Holy mackerel!
           Wowzers. Never met him myself but
           there he is! Right there. Real.
           Living, breathing. Oh boy!

                         

          EXT. DISNEYLAND - DAY

          Ralph jump out of the car to let his passenger out but Disney
          is there first.

                          WALT
           Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!
          Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of
          her head with brightness of the place, unbelievable colour
          and excitement.

                          PAMELA
           Is it all like this?
          Pamela pops a headache pill.

                          WALT
           Yup! Isn't it wonderful?
          Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much
          Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away.

                          PAMELA
           Do you always get everything you
           want Walter?

                          WALT
           Pretty much!

                          PAMELA
           With the exception to the rights to
           my books of course!

                          WALT
           War ain't over yet Pam!
          Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates
          and a murmur goes through the crowds as they gawp. A YOUNG
          WOMAN breaks free and rushes up to Walt.

                          YOUNG WOMAN
           I love you so much! Can I--?
          She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a
          signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and
          hands it to the woman.

                          PAMELA

                          (DISGUSTED)
           Pre-signed?

                          WALT

                          (TO WOMAN)
           You should get hers too.
           (gesturing to Pamela)
           This woman's a bona fide genius!
          The woman looks expectantly at Pamela who just snorts. she
          realizes she's getting nothing and, clutching her precious
          postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part
          like the red sea for Walt and his guest.

                         

          EXT. MAIN STREET - DISNEYLAND - CONTINUOUS

          Walt and Pamela make their way down Main Street. Walt stops
          anyone from getting too close by immediately handing out
          postcards to anyone who gets near.

                          WALT
           In Adventureland there is a tree--
           this is a fun fact. A titbit.

                          PAMELA
           Tidbit.

                          WALT

                          (OVER)
           It has three million leaves, four
           million flowers.

                          PAMELA
           Gosh.

                          WALT
           And they said only God could make a
           tree!
          Pamela rolls her eyes.
          There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed
          by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just
          background colour.
          They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window.
          It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices
          the look but doesn't say anything.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Where did she come from?

                          PAMELA
           Who?

                          WALT
           I think you know who.

                          PAMELA
           She flew in through the window one
           day.

                          WALT
           Through the window huh?
          Pamela nods curtly.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           It's just that easy isn't it Mrs
           Travers?
          He sees right through her.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           I know you don't wanna be here so
           I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my
           favourite amusement and then I'll
           set you free.
          Way ahead of them the carousel spins in the distance.

                         

          EXT. KING ARTHUR'S CAROUSEL - DISNEYLAND - DAY

          The carousel slows to a halt and a herd of excited children
          climb down from the horses and disappear into the park.

                          WALT
           Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if
           you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs
           Disney's favourite horse.
          He escorts Pamela to a beautiful white horse, roses on it's
          bridal.

                          PAMELA
           No thank you. I'm happy to watch.

                          WALT
           No greater joy than that seen
           through the eyes of a child.
          Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           There's a child in us all.

                          PAMELA
           Maybe in you Mister Disney, but
           certainly not I.

                          WALT
           Get on the horse Pamela!
          Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           When we first met, you said to me
           `they're family.'

                          PAMELA
           I said what?

                          WALT
           Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're
           family.

                          (BEAT)
           The boys have had an idea for your
           Mister Banks. I think it'll make
           you happy.

                          PAMELA
           You brought me all the way out here
           to tell me that?

                          WALT
           No. I brought you all the way out
           here for monetary gain. Had a wager
           with the boys that I couldn't get
           you on a ride. I win!
          He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride
          controller and off they go!
          Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she
          sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney
          spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to
          surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if
          shooting for the stars.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Yah!

                         

          INT. TRAVER'S BEDROOM - ALLORA - DAY

          Travers has a violent coughing fit, he looks to his hand,
          disturbed to see blood there. He grimaces at Ellie who has
          her back to him as she folds clothes, a look of deep
          satisfaction on her face.

                          ELLIE
           Well begun, is half done!
          His face softens as his hazy gaze falls upon Ginty, outside
          the window, sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an
          unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close
          with tiredness.

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          All the tables have been pushed to the walls, Don is just
          pushing the last one away as Pamela comes in, followed by
          Dolly with the tray carrying Pamela's tea.

                          DON
           Good morning Mrs Travers!
          She looks at the new arrangement of the room.

                          PAMELA
           What horrors have you in store for
           my beautiful characters today, hm?
          Bob clenches a fist but Dick gives him a look that says: keep
          calm.

                          DON
           Now, Mrs Travers you sit here.
          He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room. He
          hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to
          their knees so that they are half the height of Bob.
          Pamela raises an eyebrow.

                          DON (CONT'D)
           We thought about what you said Mrs
           Travers and Mr Banks isn't cruel.
           He isn't. We've got a new ending
           for the film. Oh god, I hope you
           like it.
          Bob pulls a kite out from behind his back.

                          DON (CONT'D)

                          (AS MICHAEL)
           Michael says, "He mended it! It's
           wonderful!"

                          DOLLY

                          (AS JANE)
           However did you manage it?

                          PAMELA

                          (TO HERSELF)
           He mended it?
          Dick strikes a chord on the piano.

                          DICK

                          (SINGING)
           With tuppence for paper and strings
           You can have your own set of wings
           With your feet on the ground
           You're a bird in flight
           with your fist holding tight
           To the string of your kite
           Oh oh oh oh
          Bob takes the hands of Don and Dolly and he dances around
          with them (awkwardly as they are still on their knees and Bob
          has a limp.) Pamela's eyes on the fixed kite.

                          DICK & BOB
           Let's go fly a kite
           Up to the highest height
           Let's go fly a kite and send it

                          SOARING
           Up through the atmosphere
           Up where the air is clear
           Oh let's go fly a kite
          Don notices Pamela's foot tapping, he stands up.

                          DON
           And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch
           her suffragettes ribbon.

                          DOLLY
           (as Mrs Banks)
           "A proper kite needs a proper tail
           don't you think?!"
          Don drops to his knees again.

           BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY
           Let's go fly a kite
           Up to the highest height
          Is Pamela humming too?!

           BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY (CONT'D)
           Let's go fly a kite and send it

                          SOARING
          Don bows to Pamela puts his hand out to her and to his
          surprise, she accepts and they begin to waltz. Pamela is
          surprisingly elegant and accomplished.

           BOB/DICK/DON/DOLLY/PAMELA
           Up through the atmosphere
           Up where the air is clear
           Oh let's go fly a kite
          Everybody is up and dancing, it's like something out of a
          Disney movie!

                          DICK
           When you send it flying up there
           All at once you're lighter than air
          Dolly breaks away and rushes from the room.

                          DICK (CONT'D)
           You can dance on the breeze over
           houses and trees--

                         

          INT. DISNEY OUTER OFFICE - DAY

          Dolly pants her way to the top of the stairs, and sees Walt
          just about to enter his office.

                          DOLLY
           Mr Disney! Walt!
          Walt spins around.

                          DOLLY (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just
           she-- she's dancing! Mrs Travers.
           She's dancing with Don!
          He cracks a great big smile.

           DICK (V.O.)
           With your fist holding tight
           To the string of your kite

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          As before.

           BOB/DICK/DON/PAMELA
           Oh Oh Oh Oh
           Let's go fly a kite
           Up to the highest height
           Let's go fly a kite and send it

                          SOARING
           Up through the atmosphere
           Up where the air is clear
           Oh let's go fly a kite!
          They all collapse in a heap, exhausted and thrilled.

                          PAMELA
           Well.

                          BOB
           Well?

                          PAMELA
           Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love
           it!
          Dick punches the air.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Though proper English would be `Let
           us go and fly a kite.'
          Bob glares at her.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           But I might be willing to overlook
           that.

                          BOB
           Did we get that on tape?
          Everybody sighs with relief and Pamela looks to the
          caricature of Mr Banks with deep warmth.

                         

          INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - EVENING

          Ginty sits with her father, he's a shadow of his former self,
          extremely ill. The shaking has stopped, his lips are parched
          and blueish.

                          TRAVERS
           Look at you-- all ship shape.
          Travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up Ginty's
          perfectly plaited hair.

                          GINTY
           I re-wrote the poem father.
          Travers doesn't respond. Ginty reaches into her pocket, takes
          out tuppence.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)
           The aunt gave me tuppence.
          She shows it to him in her open palm.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)
           Shall I buy you something father?

          Pamela sits bolt upright in bed, panicked.

           Father?

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

          Ginty skips off the porch, clutching her tuppence. Chattering
          to herself about pears.

          Ralph admires the view as he always does.

                          PAMELA
           Do you know you're quite right? It
           is beautiful. Exquisite.

                          RALPH
           It's always new.

                         

          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

          Pamela leans on the piano peering at her script. The boys are
          dotted about the room; all are mid-work.

                          (TO PAMELA)
           So Jolly Holiday's in?

                          PAMELA
           As you wish.
          Pamela is genuinely curious.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Now, how in the world does Mister
           Disney propose to train penguins to
           dance?!

           Are you serious?

                          PAMELA
           I've heard about his implausibly
           leaved trees so I assume he does
           have some insane penguin wrangling
           scheme but it does seem rather far
           fetched. Can you train penguins?

          Pamela's face turns beetroot red, she pushes herself away
          from the table and storms out of the room, slamming the door
          behind her.

                          DON (CONT'D)
           Crap.

          Pamela comes storming into the offices suite. Dolly smiles up
          from her desk.

                          DOLLY
           Good afternoon Mrs Travers!

                          PAMELA
           Where is Mister Disney?

           If you'd like to take a seat--

                          PAMELA
           I would not like to take a seat
           thank you. I would like to--
          She heads for Disney's office and Dolly is up and running
          after her down the corridor.

                          DOLLY
           Mrs Travers, please!
          Pamela blows past Tommie's desk.

          INT. WALT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Pamela pushes open Walt's doors, catching him in the midst of
          signing a stack of postcards of his grinning face, an unlit
          cigarette in his pen hand.

                          TOMMIE
           Walt, I'm so sorry.

                          WALT
           Don't worry Tommie, please close
           the door.
          Disney gestures to his cigarette.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Never let anybody see me smoking.
           I'd hate to encourage bad habits.

           Mrs Travers, what in the world has
           upset you so?

                          PAMELA
           Penguins!
          Walt is confused.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Penguins have very much upset me
           Mister Disney! Animated, dancing
           penguins! Now, you have seduced me
           with the music Mr Disney, yes you
           have. Those Sherman boys have quite
           turned my head but I shall not be
           moved on the matter of cartoons.
           Not one inch sir!

                          WALT
           It's a sequence--

                          PAMELA
           You promised me. You promised me
           that this film would not be an
           animation!

                          WALT
           And it isn't!

                          PAMELA
           So they're real penguins?

                          WALT
           No they're animated.

           Oh.
           (to herself, smiling

                          RUEFULLY)
           You foolish old woman.
          Pamela reaches into her purse and pulls out the assignment of
          rights papers and leaves them on the table.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Good day Mister Disney.
          She turns on her heel and leaves. Disney stares at the pages
          aghast.

          Pamela flees to her bench, wrapping her arms around herself.
          Disney comes after her.

                          WALT
           Please Mrs Travers-- You must
           listen.

                          PAMELA
           You shouldn't make promises you
           can't keep, especially to children,
           they hold on to them you see? And
           those promises they just sit there
           inside of them, like little doses
           of poison, all those broken
           promises, eating away forever.

                          WALT
           Pamela? I don't understand why this
           is so hard for you. Please, make me

                          UNDERSTAND--

                          PAMELA
           The books weren't written for the
           children. They were written for the
           promise breakers.

                          WALT
           The promise breakers? Mrs Travers I-

          Ralph pulls up and gets out of the car.

                          RALPH
           Woah! Mister Disney!

                          WALT

          He suddenly sees that Pamela is more deeply entrenched in
          herself than usual and his priority becomes her.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)

                          (TO WALT)
           Excuse me.
          Ralph moves past Walt and gently taps Pamela on the shoulder,
          she opens her eyes, relieved to see him.

                          RALPH (CONT'D)
           You ready to go Mrs?

                          PAMELA

           I'm so sorry Mister Disney. To have
           put everyone to so much trouble.

                          WALT
           You must reconsider. You must.

                          PAMELA
           I simply can't give her up. Not
           yet. Perhaps not ever. I don't know

                          WHY

                          DISNEY
           You do know why!

           I can't, he's--

                          DISNEY
           He's?

                          PAMELA
           I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney.
          She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her
          but Ralph blocks it.

                          RALPH
           The lady's ready to go now sir.
          Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car.

                          WALT
           He's?
          Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and
          confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his
          arms around himself and looks to the sky.

                         

          EXT. LAX - DAY

          Ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for
          Pamela. He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and
          opens the trunk of the car.

                          RALPH
           It's been a pleasure driving you
           Mrs.

           No one likes a fibber.

                          (CHUCKLES)
           I really have enjoyed it. Didn't
           know who you were at first and then
           guess what?

                          PAMELA
           You found out?

                          RALPH
           I was telling my daughter all about
           my day and how I was driving this
           nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for
           Mr Disney and--

                          PAMELA

                          PASSENGER WINDOW)
           And she makes me go to her bedroom
           and get this!

           slow mind you.
          Pamela smiles.

                          PAMELA
           Would you like me to sign it?

           Would you?!

                          PAMELA
           I'd be honoured.
          Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Your daughters name?

           Really?

                          RALPH
           Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.

                          PAMELA

           To Jane and her dearest father--
           (she looks at him)
           I've just this instant realized I
           don't know your name.

                          RALPH
           Ralph.
          She shakes his hand.

                          PAMELA
           Pamela.

                          RALPH
           Pamela.

                          PAMELA
           You're the only American I have
           ever liked, Ralph.
          Ralph is chuffed to bits.

                          RALPH
           May I ask why?

                          PAMELA
           No. Now take this--
          She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery
          with her notes on.

           They all had difficulties. Jane can
           do anything that anyone else can
           do, do you understand?
          Ralph looks at her in awe.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
           Look at the bottom.

          Tommie and Dolly silence their gossiping as a tired and
          broken Walt Disney appears in front of them.

                          WALT
           She's gone?
          Tommie looks down at her paperwork and nods at Walt
          apologetically.

           Then who's Travers?
          Tommie and Dolly look at each other and shrug.

          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag. She
          ruffles Andrew's fur before entering the house.

          INT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

          Ginty senses something wrong, she hears hushed, urgent and
          emotional voices in the hall. She pokes her head into the
          hallway. There, huddled together, whispering are her mother,
          the doctor and Aunt Ellie.
          Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.
          Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of
          her heart.
          Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo.
          There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen,
          shattered. She comes down to Ginty's level.

                          MARGARET

                          DADDY--
          Ginty cannot react.
          Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown
          paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor.
          Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the
          chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.

                          GINTY
           I want to see my father.

                          MARGARET
           No, you mustn't.

                          GINTY
           I want to see him!
          Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing,
          biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers.

                          AUNT ELLIE
           Let her go Margaret.
          Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father's
          bedroom.

                         

          INT. TRAVERS' BEDROOM - DAY

          Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed. She
          stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step
          by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The
          sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted
          with blood. The front of her father's nightdress is also
          bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes
          open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither
          peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing.

                          GINTY
           I dropped the pears.
          She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry daddy.
          Ellie appears in the doorway, Ginty addresses her without
          turning around.

                          GINTY (CONT'D)
           You promised you would fix
           everything.

                         

          EXT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY

          A black London Taxi pulls up outside the house. Pamela climbs
          out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out
          too.

                         

          INT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY

          Pamela moves through the vestibule, lugging her suitcase.

                          PAMELA
           Hello house.

                         

          INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in
          darkness. She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and
          a lifetime's despair.
          There's a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn't
          know how long she's been asleep but it's black outside. She
          gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will
          take her.
          She swings it open.

                          PAMELA
           Oh dear god!
          Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite
          literally, speechless.

                          WALT
           It was one heck of a job getting a
           seat on the very next flight, let
           me tell you.

                          PAMELA
           But, you always get what you want
           eventually. Isn't that right
           Walter?
          He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking.

                          WALT
           How about you show me how to make
           one of those nice English pots of
           tea?

                         

          INT. PAMELA'S DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

          Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a
          teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he
          places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.

                          PAMELA
           Milk. The milk goes in first.
          He attends to it.

                          WALT
           I remember.

                          PAMELA
           And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in
           mine.
          Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes
          it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.

                          WALT

                          (SURPRISED)
           Oh.

                          (BEAT)
           Oh well, when in Rome!
          He pours a slug into his tea too.

                          PAMELA
           You've come to change my mind. To
           beat me into submission.

                          WALT
           No, I've come because you misjudge
           me.

                          PAMELA
           How do I misjudge you?

                          WALT
           You look at me and you see some
           kind of Hollywood King Midas.

                          (MORE)

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           You think I've built an empire and
           that I want to use your Mary
           Poppins as just another brick in my
           kingdom. You think I see her with a
           carpetbag full of greenbacks.

                          PAMELA
           And don't you?

                          WALT
           If that was all it was would I have
           pursued an cranky, stubborn dame
           like you for twenty years? I'd've
           have saved myself an ulcer!

                          (BEAT)
           No, you expected me to disappoint
           you and so you made sure I did. You
           see, I think life disappoints you,
           Mrs Travers. I think it's done
           that a lot. Maybe Mary Poppins is
           the only person in your life who
           hasn't.

                          PAMELA
           Mary Poppins isn't real.

                          WALT
           Oh, no, that's not true. She's real
           as can be to my daughter's and to
           thousands of other children--
           adults too. She's been there as a
           nighttime comfort to a heck of a
           lot of people.

                          PAMELA
           Well, Where is she when I need her?
           Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins
           and who should be standing there
           but Walt Disney!
          He laughs.

                          WALT
           Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped
           this would be a magical experience
           for you, for all of us. But I let
           you down-- and in doing so, I've
           broken a twenty year old promise to
           my girls.

                          (BEAT)
           I've been wracking my brains,
           trying to figure out why this has
           been so hard for you and I--

                          (BEAT)
           You see, I have my own Mr Banks.
           Mine had a moustache.

                          PAMELA
           Ah! Not true then that Disney
           created man in his own image?

                          WALT
           But it is true that you created
           yourself in someone else's yes?
          She doesn't answer. Walt takes mouthful of laced tea and
          coughs a little.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs
           Travers? Do you know Missouri at
           all?

                          PAMELA
           Can't say I do and as I have no
           plans to ever set foot on American
           soil again I'm afraid I never will.

                          WALT
           It's mighty cold there in the
           winters. Bitter.
          Walt stops talking, catches himself, looks away and then
          gives in. His enthusiasm completely disappears and he's
          suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           (it pours out)
           My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a
           newspaper delivery route there.
           Thousand papers. Twice daily.
           Morning and evening edition. Elias,
           he was a tough businessman. A save-
           a-penny anywhere you can type of
           fella so he wouldn't employ any
           delivery boys, he just used me and
           my big brother Roy. I was eight
           then-- eight years old.

                          (BEAT)
           Like I said, those winters were
           harsh and old Elias didn't believe
           in new shoes until the old ones
           were worn right through so--

                          (BEAT)
           Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow
           would be up to here--
          He gestures to his knees.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           You'd push through it like wading
           through molasses.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           And the cold and the wet would be
           seeping through the shoes and the
           skin would be raw and peeling from
           our faces-- and sometimes I'd find
           myself sunk down in the snow,
           waking up, cuz I must've passed out
           for a moment-- I dunno. Then
           school, too cold to figure out an
           equation. And back into the snow so
           by the time we got home it'd be
           just getting dark, and every part
           of you would sting like crazy as it
           slowly came back to life in the
           warmth. My mother would feed us
           dinner and then it'd be time to go
           out again for the evening edition.

           Best be quick Walt, best be quick
           or poppa's gonna show you the
           buckle end again boy.
          Walt smiles at Pamela, sips his tea.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Now, I don't tell you all this to
           make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't.
           I love my life - it's a miracle.
           And I loved my daddy, boy I loved
           him. But, there isn't a day goes by
           where I don't think of that little
           boy in the snow and old Elias with
           his fist and strap and I'm just so
           tired-- I'm tired of remembering it
           that way. Aren't you tired Mrs
           Travers? We all have our tales but
           don't you want to find a way to
           finish the story? Let it all go and
           have a life that isn't dictated by
           a past?

           Mrs. Travers. It's all about him
           isn't it? All of this. Everything.
          Pamela looks at her hands, they're shaking.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Forgiveness. It's what I learned
           from your books.

                          PAMELA
           I don't need to forgive my father.
           He was a wonderful man.

                          WALT
           No, you need to forgive Helen Goff.
           Life is a harsh sentence to lay
           down for yourself.
          Pamela looks down at the table top.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           Give her to me, Mrs Travers. Trust
           me with your precious Mary Poppins.
           I won't disappoint you. I swear
           that every time a person goes into
           a movie house - from Leicester to
           St Louis, they will see George
           Banks being saved. They will love
           him and his kids, they will weep
           for his cares, and wring their
           hands when he loses his job. And
           when he flies that kite, oh! They
           will rejoice, they will sing. In
           every movie house, all over the
           world, in the eyes and the hearts
           of my kids, and other kids and
           their mothers and fathers for
           generations to come, George Banks
           will be honoured. George Banks will
           be redeemed. George Banks and all
           he stands for will be saved.
           Maybe not in life, but in
           imagination. Because that's what we
           storytellers do. We restore order
           with imagination. We instill hope
           again and again and again. Trust
           me, Mrs Travers. Let me prove it to
           you. I give you my word.

                         

          INT. PAMELA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Pamela is alone. The unsigned rights papers in front of her
          on the table. She looks at Mickey who occupies the chair
          opposite her, her face softens under his gaze.

                          PAMELA
           Enough.

          EXT. ANIMATION BUILDING - THREE YEARS LATER - DAY

          Disney employees pass by a giant movie poster which reads:

          but a few steps out of the door when Tommie appears behind
          him.

                          TOMMIE
           Walt.
          She hands him a sheet of paper.

           Okay.
          Walt walks away, he's lost a bit of steam. Tommy watches him
          go.

           I should say so too.
          The doorbell sounds, voices.
          Pamela begins to tap again.

           POLLY (O.S.)

          Pamela rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt.

           For goodness sake!
          She rises from her chair, smoothes down her skirt and makes
          her way to the front door.

                          (TO DIARMUID)
           It's coming along marvelously!
          Polly kicks the door open with her foot and plonks the tea
          down in front of Pamela and Diarmuid. She sneezes twice,
          doesn't bother to pour and turns to leave.

                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

                          (TO POLLY)
           Would you pour please?

                          POLLY
           You're perfectly capable of doing
           it yourself.
          Polly leaves, Pamela rolls her eyes.

                          PAMELA
           She's quite the worst maid I've
           ever had!

                          DIARMUID
           So why do you keep her?

                          PAMELA
           I don't know-- she reminds me of
           me.
          Diarmuid laughs.

                          DIARMUID
           Do you have a title?

                          PAMELA
           Mary Poppins in the Kitchen.

                          DIARMUID
           Wonderful. Should we start talking
           about the film rights?
          Pamela narrows her eyes at him.

                          PAMELA
           NEVER again.

                          DIARMUID
           Okay.

                          (BEAT)
           Now, tell me, Have you got your
           tiara for the premiere?

                          PAMELA
           Oh, I'm not going.

                          DIARMUID
           Why not?

                          PAMELA
           Hollywood premieres are not for old
           trout like me. Anyway, it's not

                          CONVENIENT--

                          DIARMUID
           He hasn't invited you, has he?
          Pamela doesn't reply.

                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)
           Mary Poppins wouldn't stand for
           that.

                         

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle her cabin
          baggage into an overhead locker. The same flight attendant
          from the top of the film appears.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Can I help you?

                          PAMELA
           I'm perfectly capable thank you.
          The flight attendant recognizes her with something akin to
          horror.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Suit yourself-- ma'am.

                          PAMELA

                          (CHEERY)
           I shall!

           CAPTAIN (O.S.)
           Ladies and gentlemen, good
           afternoon and welcome aboard this
           flight to Los Angeles. Just a few
           announcements before we begin our
           taxi for takeoff--
          Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at
          the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

                         

          INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

          Walt enters the outer office walking briskly towards his own
          office.

                          WALT
           Morning Dolly.
          Dolly opens her mouth to speak but he's already past and

                         APPROACHING--

                         TOMMIE'S DESK
          Tommie sits, arms crossed and stares, half bemused at Walt.

                          WALT (CONT'D)
           What?
          Tommie nods toward his office. Pamela is sitting in a chair,
          back to them.

                          PAMELA
           Me again!

                         

          INT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY

          Walt semi-recovers as quickly as possible and enters his
          office.

                          WALT
           Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see
           you. What brings you to--

                          PAMELA
           I'm here for my premiere.

                          WALT
           Great!

                         

                         

                          PAMELA
           I didn't receive my invitation, but
           I just assumed the American postal
           service had fallen down on the job
           as per usual.
          She smiles sweetly.

                          WALT
           I'll have a-- uh, replacement sent
           to your hotel right away.

                          PAMELA
           That's very kind, Mr Disney. I knew
           you wouldn't have forgotten me.

                          WALT
           Pam, how could I?

                          PAMELA
           How indeed? You did, after all,
           assure me that I wouldn't be
           disappointed.

                         

          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

          The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother
          hovering for a tip.
          Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the
          chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere
          of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous
          stuffed Mickey Mouse.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO MICKEY)
           I thought I left you in London.

                         

          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - FORECOURT - NIGHT

          Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise
          silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her
          shoulders.

                          PAMELA

                          (TO DOORMAN)
           Would you call me a taxi please?

                          DOORMAN
           Absolutely.
          The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo
          pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up
          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person
          in America.

                          RALPH
           Had a feeling a certain friend of
           mine might be needing me tonight.

                          PAMELA
           Ralph!
          She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.

                          RALPH
           You look like a million bucks!
           Let's get you to the ball.
          He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.

                         

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

          It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs
          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red
          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters
          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their
          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens
          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream
          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and
          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces
          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing
          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is
          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest
          party you could ever go to.

                         

          INT. LIMO - NIGHT

          Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers
          press their faces against the windows trying to make out who
          is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with
          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.

                         

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT

          The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.
          He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.
          Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm
          up to shield her eyes. It's too much.

                          RALPH
           (in her ear)
           This is your night. None of this
           would be possible without you.
          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks
          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic
          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is
          that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and
          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.
          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved
          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.

                         

          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

          Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect
          toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.

                         

          INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

          The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of
          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the
          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin
          to dim. The overture begins--
          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade
          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers
          old melody's rings in her ears.
          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain
          with Pamela.
          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,
          humming, sad, happy, joyous.
          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices
          of Bert and Jane -
          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--

                          BERT
           You know, begging your pardon, but
           the one my heart goes out to is
           your father.
          The carousel horses at the Allora fair--

                          BERT (CONT'D)
           There he is in that cold, heartless
           bank day after day, hemmed in by
           mounds of cold, heartless
           money.
          The tuppence and rolling pears--

                          BERT (CONT'D)
           I don't like to see any living
           thing caged up.
          Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river
          soaked mother back to the house--

                          JANE
           Father in a cage?
          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--

                          BERT
           They makes cages in all sizes and
           shapes, you know.
          The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--

                          BERT (CONT'D)
           Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets
           and all.

                          DISSOLVE TO:
          Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.
          Rapt.

                          MICHEAL
           You won't ever leave us will you?

                          JANE
           Whatever would we do without you?

                          MARY POPPINS
           I shall stay until the wind
           changes.
          And then an image from the film:
          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined
          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.
          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.
          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her
          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud
          but people are noticing, looking at her.
          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She
          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.

                          WALT
           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's
           alright. Mr Banks is going to be
           all right. I promise.
          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's
          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.

                          PAMELA
           No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I
           can't abide cartoons!
          We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the
          film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are
          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent
          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to
          mouth along with the lyrics.
          And in her head one final image appears.
          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,
          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken
          understanding of what is to come, before his close with
          tiredness.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)
           Never. I promise. I will never lose
           you.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

                         

          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY

          The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty
          sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her
          chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her
          face.

           TRAVERS (V.O.)

                          (SINGING)
           Winds in the East
           Mist coming in--
          The shadow of an umbrella, floats higher and higher--

                          TRAVERS
           --Like something is brewing,
           about to begin--
          And further and further--

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           Can't put me finger on what lies in

                          STORE--
          We give chase but cannot catch up--

                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
           But I feel what's to happen, all

                          HAPPENED BEFORE--
          And the umbrella floats up, up, up into the atmosphere and

                         AWAY--

                          FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:

          EXT. THE STAPLES CENTER - PRESENT DAY

          We hear the faint sounds of a crowd cheering on Kobe Bryant.
          The real Bob Costas does narration.

          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          Before the NBA was the NBA, there
          was another basketball league in
          America...
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of
          great plays are made by ABA stars.

           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          .From 1967 to 1976, there was the
          American Basketball Association. A
          maverick minor-league that would
          change the game forever. The ABA
          made the fast break FAST...
          Invented the three point shot...
          And introduced the world to
          something called the Slam Dunk
          Contest.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and
          dunks in the world's first dunk contest. David Thompson
          finishes an Alley Oop.

          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland
          Oaks. Wilt Chambelain coached the
          Conquistadors. I myself was the
          young voice of the St. Louis
          Spirits.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A young Bob Costas broadcasts from St.
          Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket.

          BOB COSTAS (V.O.)
          Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George
          Gervin and Moses Malone were as
          entertaining as they come. But
          despite the league's flair,
          convincing fans to show up for
          games was often a struggle.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy
          Lewis wins a 'race horse.' Footage of 'Dime Beer Night.'
          Footage of the Kentucky Colonials fielding a cheerleader as
          one of their starting five.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          BOB COSTAS (V.0. )
          For owners, promotional ideas
          became an art form all to
          themselves.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The Miami Ball Girls dance in bikinis
          (In truth, some of the girls were still in high school).

          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          One night, the Nets went as far as
          to give a free gerbil to it's first
          fifty fans... There were plenty of
          punches too, giving the National
          Hockey League a run for it's money.
          DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns
          and punches the guy in the face.

          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          Yes, the ABA had a style all it's
          own. The hair was big, the shorts

           BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          In 1976, rumors of a merger spread
          throughout the league. In the end,
          only four teams would join the NBA
          and survive.

          QUICK CUTS: THE PACERS. THE NUGGETS. THE NETS. THE SPURS.

          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          Teams like the Kentucky Colonels
          and the Virginia Squires would
          disappear forever. But their spirit
          still lives on to this day.

          EXT. A BASKETBALL STADIUM - 1976

          We hear a crowd going crazy.

          BOB COSTAS (V.0.)
          Here, we present the legend of the
          ABA... Exactly as it happened.
          Some FUNKY MUSIC plays.

          never existed.

          INT. AMIGO STADIUM - DAY


          TITLE CARD: ANAHEIM AMIGO STADIUM, 1976.
          CLOSE ON: A logo of a basketball with a sombrero on it.

          "LET'S GO AMIGOS!"
          Welcome to the American Basketball Association. A fan chugs
          his beer and throws some guacamole.
          The crowd screams and curses at MONIX, mid 40'S -- talented,
          but past his prime. (There are three leading characters in
          this movie. This is the old rock. Think Nolte in 48 hours.
          Cosner in Durham. Newman in Slap Shot).

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          The Amigos are up by one here.
          They'll need to find a way to stop
          Monix. He checks the clock,
          waits... And now drives the lane...
          MONIX suddenly takes a HUGE HIT, TOTALLY SLAMMED by a big
          asshole, PETRELLI. He flies into the crowd -- everyone
          erupts, screaming with glee.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Ooh, Monix gets taken out hard.
          Some tough love from Patrelli.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          WHAT!? Where's the foul on that?
          That was all ball.
          (covering mic, screaming)
          Jesus Christ Leonard! Let them play
          for once! This ain't fuckin'
          Greenpeace!

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Some might say that was a close
          call, but these referees have done
          a nice job tonight.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          'Oh please. These refs SUCK.
          Still stuck in the crowd. Monix struggles to get back on the
          court. The crowd shoves him around, twisting his ankle,
          slapping him. The crowd is nuts.

          

          

          

          

          4.

          DRUNK LADY
          Hey Monix, want a sip?
          Monix is confused, until the woman throws the beer in his
          face.

          DRUNK LADY
          (smart ass)
          Oops.
          She and her friends laugh. Monix says nothing. Instead, he
          holds his aching back and limps up to the foul line, annoyed.

          PATRELLI

          (SMILING)
          Sorry, Monix, I got pushed.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Well, it looks like the Amigos are
          in trouble here. Monix is a ninety
          percent shooter, if he can hit both
          of these free throws, it's over.
          Monix performs his ancient free throw ritual: Three dribbles
          and a quick spin of the ball. But he MISSES.

          DRUNK LADY

          HA. NICE SHOT MONIX! YOU FUCKIN'

          SUCK, MAN! YOU SUCK DONKEY DICK.
          Again, Monix ignores the drunk lady.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          They dodged a bullet there. But
          Monix still has one last chance to
          tie it up.
          Monix focuses on his ritual again.

          DRUNK LADY

          WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? SHOOT THE

          BALL YOU PUSSY!
          Monix aims at the basket, about to shoot, but then suddenly

          WHIPS THE BALL HARD AT THE LADY, PEGGING HER IN THE FACE.

          DRUNK LADY

          AHH!

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          (re: nailing the girl)
          And the second free throw sails
          wide.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          Yes! He just pegged a chick! That's
          the greatest thing I've ever seen.
          The lady runs on court and attacks Monix, her boyfriend jumps
          in -- Monix hits her boyfriend with some quick hockey
          punches. The benches clear, everyone is punching everybody.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          (re: violent fist fight)
          And we've got a little bit of
          pushing and shoving under the
          basket. What do you make of this,
          Lou?

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          I'm goin' in.
          Lou Redwood takes his headphones off, climbs over the
          announcer's table and jumps into the fight.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

          Monix is beat up pretty bad. He dabs his cut with toilet
          paper.

          SCHNACK (O.S. )
          Want one?
          SCHNACK, the owner, carries a six pack of Schlitz.

          MONIX
          I'll take two.
          Schnack hands them over. Monix might speak, but he drinks
          instead.

          SCHNACK
          So, Monix. The trade went through.

          MONIX
          Really?

          SCHNACK
          You know, you're not exactly a
          spring chicken anymore...

          MONIX
          Just tell me.

          SCHNACK
          That score board.
          ANGLE ON: Pieces of an old scoreboard are crammed into the
          back of the locker room.

          SCHNACK
          It's a Magnovox.

          (BEAT)
          Tell me: What the Hell did you want
          to get traded back to Flint for, of
          all places? Please tell me this
          isn't about Lynn.

          MONIX
          You still owe me $400.

          ECU: AN OLD TV. A COMMERCIAL PLAYS:
          Super-cool CLARENCE WITHERS, 20's African-American, walks
          around a pet store. This guy is all flash. He spins a ball on
          his finger, but he's more Bootsy Collins than Dr. J.

          CLARENCE (V.0.)
          (on TV)
          Don't get all lonely on me people,
          get yourself a dog or a cat or some-
          - (studies a weird animal) Or a
          couple of these, from PET GALAXY.
          When I'm not dribbling between my
          legs or sinking jump shots, I'm
          buying animals. And if this isn't

          7.
          With that, Clarence chest-passes the ball out of frame and
          smiles.

          INT. QUINCY'S BBQ - NIGHT

           WE PULL BACK to see the TV is on inside a restaurant,
          Quincy's BBQ.
           REVEAL: Clarence. The guy from the TV is also a waiter in
           this restaurant. He's taking an order from some customers.

          CUSTOMER
          Hey, wasn't that you just now,
          there on the TV?

          CLARENCE
          Yeah, so?

          CUSTOMER
          What are you waiting on us for, if
          you're a basketball star?

          CUSTOMER
          The TV said your name was Sugar
          Dunkerton. How come your name-tag
          doesn't say that?

          CLARENCE
          'Cause I changed my name, that's

          A large woman, QUINCY -- Clarence's Mom -- yells from the
          kitchen.

          QUINCY

          HEY CLARENCE!

          CLARENCE
          Shit.
          (to the customers)
          It's been a pleasure serving you.
          Clarence tosses his note pad on the table and his Mother
          tosses him his duffle bag.

          MS. QUINCY
          And don't think I didn't see those
          cotton briefs of yours in there.

          CLARENCE
          Stay outta my stuff!

          MS. QUINCY
          Don't you know our ancestors had to
          pick that cotton? Get yourself some
          silk underpants. Have some respect.

          CLARENCE
          Panties are silk. Briefs are
          cotton. I'm out of here.

          FLINT TROPICS.

          EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT

          Center court, we finally see JACKIE MOON. He sports a perm,
          lamb chop sideburns and black frame glasses. He continues to
          sing this song of his own creation...

          JACKIE MOON

          (SINGING)
          Oh yeah, Baby, who wants to; love
          me sexy. baby, are you ready to;
          lick me sexy.
          Jackie Moon is a sight to see. His one-hit-wonder is
          ridiculous. But you have to admit it's catchy.

          QUICK CUTS: THE RETARDED WORLD OF THE FLINT TROPICS:
          THE CROWD: Under 100 people are in the stands, but they're
          high energy. Lots of drinking and dancing.

          THE BALL GIRLS: They bounce around in shiny-funky hot pants --
          dancing cool, but not in sync. When it comes to ball girls,
          Flint delivers.
          THE TROPICAL AISLE: A rowdy bunch is decked out in Hawaiian
          shirts and packed in behind the visiter's bench, looking for
          trouble.
          THE SCOREBOARD: The Magnovox has been sold. The Tropics now
          do it by hand.

          With that, the lights go out, PITCH BLACK. A spot light drops
          on Jackie Moon.

          JACKIE MOON

          SO TELL ME FLINT, ARE WE HOT

          ENOUGH? WHO'S READY FOR SOME HOT,

          LUSCIOUS, FLINT TROPICS ACTION?
          The crowd cheers, but not all that loud. Jackie looks off
          screen and nods off screen.
          BOBBY DEE works some sound effects, dialing up a knob that
          says CROWD NOISE. The speakers are blown, but they're loud.

          C'mon dude, let's go, get it
          together.
          Players push the giant Vakidis out onto the court.

          JACKIE MOON
          Now this next guy, where do I
          start? First of all, that wife of
          his, she is... Wow.
          (gesturing re: her chest)
          CANONS, people. If you know what
          I'm saying. I don't think she's
          here tonight, but if she was you'd
          see what I'm talking about.

          He's a small forward, the luckiest
          man in Flint: SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-

          Scootsie Double Day 'pops n' locks' his way onto the court.

          AND FINALLY: The man you've been
          waiting for, six foot four, a

          importantly, your POWER FORWARD...
          Yours truly... JACKIE M00000000N!!!
          Jackie takes off his blazer, twirls it, then tosses it off
          screen. It's game time.
          At center court, PLAYER/OWNER/COACH JACKIE huddles them up.

          JACKIE MOON
          Alright you guys, let's huddle up!
          (Vakidis is wandering)
          Vakidis! Where's he walking to?
          Kong, get Vakidis.
          A very short Asian man, KONG, nods. The uniform hangs on his
          tiny body.

          KONG
          You got it boss.

          JACKIE MOON
          (now huddled up)
          Let's put on a good show tonight,
          okay? Let's keep it in the air,
          keep shooting, look for the
          baseball pass, launch some early
          threes to set the tone. Bee Bee,
          try and do that no-look behind your
          back thing, I love that, okay? Now
          let's bring it in. One two three--

          EVERYONE

          (TOGETHER)

          LET'S GET TROPICAL!
          REVEAL: An orange cone sits over a puddle on the court.
          As the Tropics break the huddle, Jackie talks to the
          overweight FATHER PAT THE REF.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          JACKIE MOON
          (smart ass)
          Hey, you lose weight, Father Pat?

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          Oh, fuck off. What's with the cone
          tonight Jackie?
          Jackie points up to a leak in the ceiling.

          JACKIE MOON
          For safety.
          Just then, Vakidis jogs over, SLIPPING HORRIBLY in the
          puddle, ripping his groin.

          BOBBY DEE (V.0. )
          (as P.A. Announcer)
          Okay Tropics fans, it's time to
          guess today's attendance... Is it
          A) 9,254. B) 10,506.. or C) 91
          TIP OFF: The Tropics gain possession.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. )
          Scootsie drops it in low to player-
          owner-coach Jackie Moon. Known best
          for his aggressive defense, leads
          the team in rebounds. He's an
          animal under the boards Lou.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          You're Damn right. He may not be
          black, but he can play basketball.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Now, look at this, Jackie waves the
          rest of his team away, looking for
          the isolation. These fans are in
          for a real treat.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          He looks to be setting up his 'Tear
          Drop from Hades.'

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Jackie is shooting thirty-nine
          percent from the field, but the
          crowd always loves to see him go
          for it.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          He's a true showman.

          

          

          

          

          14.
          Jackie dribbles hard to the hoop, tossing up a high arcing
          baby hook. AIRBALL.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. )
          Airball.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0. )
          Yep, a Polish swish.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Scootsie Double-Day gets the
          offensive rebound and Jackie calls
          for it again, trying to establish
          the low post early.
          Jackie holds the ball, preparing for another 'Tear Drop from
          Hades'... But now he suddenly gets distracted by something up
          in the stands.

          JACKIE MOON
          (into the stands)

          HEY! RAVI! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU

          DOING, MAN?
          IN THE STANDS: A Pakistani vendor, RAVI, IS POURING CHEESE ON

          SOME NACHOS.

          RAVI
          What?

          JACKIE MOON
          Enough with the cheese already.
          More chips, less cheese, how many
          times do I have to tell you?
          WHISTLE! Jackie's been walking with the ball. FATHER PAT THE
          REF wears a holy collar with pin strips over it.

          FATHER PAT THE. REF
          Traveling.

          JACKIE MOON
          Traveling!?... On who?

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          On you.

          JACKIE MOON
          That's bullshit, Father Pat!
          Jackie, furious, SLAMS THE BALL down on the floor.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          man in sports.

          EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MEANWHILE

          Some hot girls in shorts hold up a sign that says 'ALL STAR
          PARKING.' Ms. Quincy's BBQ delivery truck rips into the lot.
          Clarence skids to a stop.

          INT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS

          The crowd looks off camera and suddenly erupts.
          CLARENCE enters out of the tunnel, he takes a bite of a
          Hershey bar, then gestures to the crowd, giving the
          international symbol for 'Let's get funky.'

          BOBBY DEE (V.0.)
          Ladies and gentleman, put your
          hands together for Downtown Funky-
          Stuff Malone!
          Clarence tosses the half eaten candy bar, wipes his hands off
          on his jersey and jogs right out onto the court during the
          game, TAGGING HIS TEAMMATE OUT as if it were pick up.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Downtown, wastes no time entering
          the game -- tagging out Vakidis
          Roscovenski.

          .CLAWS COACH
          (to the ref)
          C'mon Father Pat, he's got to check
          into the game doesn't he?
          The ref just shrugs. Downtown calls for the ball and gets it.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Downtown dribbles left, then right
          a little shake and bake through the
          legs -- double teamed now, he's got
          Twiggy Munson open under the
          basket. Downtown, still with the
          ball, dribbles behind his back,
          they triple him, he's got Munson
          and Ellis wide open under the hoop,
          but look at these moves!
          The entire other team leaves their men and guards Clarence
          five on one, but Clarence never passes. His four teammates
          watch from under the basket.

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Despite his selfish attitude, it's clear Clarence actually
          has some serious talent.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. )
          Downtown has all five guys on him --
          He sprints to the corner and forces
          up a fade away three... YES! Wow.
          You think this league's going
          bankrupt? Well, think again.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          People call him selfish. I call him
          the greatest show in shorts.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME

          CLOSE ON: An old-timey photo of a man with a handle-bar
          moustache. It's been autographed by the inventor of
          basketball: 'Go Tropics! -James Naismith'
          The team enters the locker room happy, even though they're
          losing badly at half time.

          JACKIE MOON
          Yes! Nice first half guys! That's
          what I call Flint Tropic's
          basketball!

          (BEAT)
          I've been telling you all season,
          we're about to make a run. Flint
          Michigan is destined for greatness.
          (at the chalkboard)
          Twiggy, enough with the bounce
          passes, let's show some zip. Bee
          Bee, try not to get fouled so much,
          free throws take too long.
          Scootsie, what did I tell you about
          catching with two hands.? God gave
          you one hand for a reason: To look
          awesome.
          Jackie points to the chalkboard. Where one of his catchy
          slogans is spelled out.

          JACKIE MOON
          Let's stay focused on the four

          'D'S'
          (pointing to the board)
          Dangerous, Dangerous, Dangerous,
          Dunks. Remember: This isn't just a
          basketball team. It's a lifestyle.

          

          

          

          

          17.
          Everyone claps. Meanwhile, Clarence grabs a bunch of hair
          products and goes to work. But he notices something.

          CLARENCE
          Yo, Jackie, is the washing machine
          broken?
          ANGLE ON: A few workers are taking out the washing machine.

          JACKIE MOON
          Listen up guys: I've got some good
          news and I've got some bad news.
          The good news is, we're getting rid
          of that piece of shit washing
          machine. The bad news is, everyone
          does their laundry at home from now
          on. Towels too.
          Everyone complains. Boo etc. Jackie turns to BOBBY DEE a
          'front office' guy.

          JACKIE MOON
          And Bobby Dee, I need you to clean
          out your desk.

          BOBBY DEE
          No. I have kids.

          JACKIE MOON
          You're not fired. I sold your desk.

          BOBBY DEE
          Oh.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to the team)
          And I'm going to shed a few
          lockers, so everyone's getting a
          locker buddy.

          CLARENCE
          Forget that. I need my own
          locker... For the panty dropper.
          Clarence reveals his 'panty dropper' a brown full-length
          leather coat.

          JACKIE MOON
          Fine. Now, there's one last thing:
          I've added some depth to the
          roster. I think he could deliver
          some firepower.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          CLARENCE
          Firepower? Who'd you hire?

          JACKIE MOON
          At guard, six one, the hometown
          kid, from your very own Flint
          Michigan -- He punches in bunches
          Ed MONIXXXXXXXX!
          We hear a TOILET FLUSH. Monix exits the bathroom stall
          buttoning his pants.

          MONIX
          You're out of toilet paper.
          Monix doesn't receive a warm welcome. It's more of a stare-
          off.

          JACKIE MOON
          Okay, now, I know everyone in this
          room has probably been punched in
          the face by Monix at one time or
          another.
          (Scootsie fumes)
          One of you may have even had your
          collar bone broken, twice. But
          that's in the past now and-

          BOBBY DEE (O.S. )
          Yo, Jackie, you're on in two.

          JACKIE MOON
          Thanks Bobby.
          (almost to himself)
          I love half time.
          (abruptly to Monix)
          Anyways, welcome aboard.

          (LEAVING)
          One last thing: If you see a possum
          try and kill it.
          With that, Jackie leaves. Monix faces his team in silence.

          MONIX
          So. Who wants to be my locker
          buddy?

          INT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MEANWHILE

          It's half time show. Jackie has pulled a lucky contestant
          from the audience.

          

          

          

          

          19.
          DUKES, the contestant, is shirtless with jeans, with a star-
          spangled bandana over a mullet. He plays with a ball a
          little.
          A giant five by ten check is propped up, with the words 'TEN
          THOUSAND DOLLARS' written in glitter.

          JACKIE MOON
          Ladies and Gentleman, this man is
          about to attempt the impossible.
          The $10,000 full court shot. So,
          tell me, what's your name?

          DUKES
          Dukes.

          JACKIE MOON
          Okay, Dukes. You feeling it?

          DUKES
          Yeah dude.

          JACKIE MOON
          What are you going to spend all of
          your money on if you win? A shirt?

          DUKES
          Yeah man, a shirt. Ha! Whoooo!

          JACKIE MOON
          Okay people, Dukes is excited.
          Let's get some clapping going as he
          prepares himself for the
          impossible.
          (leading the clapping)
          This is drama, folks! C'mon now,
          let's hear it! The $10,000 shot
          people, let's hear it!!!
          For the first time, Dukes looks kind of serious. He sizes up
          the distant hoop...

          JACKIE MOON
          (doing play by play)
          He looks ready... And... Here he
          goes!
          An uncoordinated baseball pass... Sailing off into the
          distance... And...

          SWISH!
          The crowd can't believe their eyes.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          JACKIE'S FACE TURNS GHOST WHITE.

          JACKIE MOON
          Shit.

          DUKES

          YES!!! HOLY SHIT DUDE!!! I'M A

          MIRACLE!!
          Jackie is freaking out. Dukes has just won $10,000! Dukes
          runs around court, shirtless, leaping in celebration.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to Father Pat the Ref)
          Did he step on the line?

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          No, it was legal. He made it.

          JACKIE MOON
          Who the Hell has $10,000? I sure he
          stepped on the line, you know what
          I'm saying?

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          (getting the hint)
          Listen to this crowd. You can't
          screw a kid over like that. People
          will kill you.
          He's right. The crowd is too hyped for Jackie to explain that
          he's broke.

          JACKIE MOON
          (accepting his fate)
          Fuck me.

          JACKIE HANDS DUKES THE GIANT CARDBOARD CHECK MADE OUT FOR

          A beautiful, down to earth woman, LYNN, 30's, is reading a
          book. In the background, her boyfriend, KYLE, is listening to
          the Tropics game on the RADIO.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Monix was an All-American at
          Michigan State, but then went on to
          a disappointing journeyman career
          in the NBA. But he did manage to
          sit on the bench with the world
          champion Boston Celtics years ago
          and won a ring.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0. )
          (on radio)
          I should hire his agent.
          Kyle listens to this and yells to the other room.

          KYLE
          Hey honey, guess who got traded to
          Flint?

          LYNN
          I don't know, who?

          KYLE
          Monix.
          The word Monix stops her in her tracks.

          LYNN
          Monix?

          KYLE
          Yeah! He's already got an NBA ring,
          but he's still playing... In Flint.
          Can you believe it?

          LYNN
          No, I can't.
          Lynn closes her book, fidgety...

          KYLE
          They say he asked to be traded. Who
          the Hell leaves California to come
          here? I love this guy.

          Get the funk outta-of-my-face...
          A SIGN SAYS: THE KREMLIN. Jackie rolls up and parks in a
          reserved parking space. He rolls up the windows and locks the
          doors by hand and exits.

          REVEAL: JACKIE HAS GIANT ICE PACKS TAPED TO HIS KNEES,

          BALL GIRL MAGGIE
          No.

          

          

          

          

          23.

          JACKIE MOON
          Don't lie to me. Those things got
          bigger.

          BALL GIRL MAGGIE
          No, they're the same.

          JACKIE MOON
          Well, good job.
          Jackie keeps walking, bumping into MS. QUINCY, Clarence's
          mother.

          MS. QUINCY
          Yo Jackie. You know, that wife of
          yours has been making out with that
          Mark Spitz lookin' motherfucker all
          night.
          She gestures to a guy who's lip-locked with Jackie's wife.
          LUCY MOON unbuttons her fur coat.

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh. It's okay, Lucy and I've got an
          open relationship.

          MS. QUINCY
          I know that. But he's about to suck
          on her Damn tits, right here in
          front of all these people.

          JACKIE MOON
          She's hot right? What can I say,
          we're freedom lovers.
          (calling off to his wife)
          Hey honey!
          Lucy Moon ignores him, only making out harder.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to his wife)
          Right on!
          (to Quincy)
          I'm not jealous. It's a sweet deal
          for both of us.

          MS. QUINCY
          Have you ever slept with another
          woman?

          JACKIE MOON
          I could. That's the beauty of it.
          No ball and chain here.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          I can just go for it. You know, if
          I ever get invited to some cool
          orgy, it's definitely not a problem
          at all.

          MS. QUINCY
          Have you ever been to an orgy?

          JACKIE MOON
          Pshh. Are you kidding? When haven't
          I been?

          INT. THE KREMLIN - AT A TABLE - MEANWHILE

          MONIX is hanging out with Bee Bee Ellis, Scootsie Double Day
          and Twiggy Munson. They all do a shot together.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          I heard Jackie is going to go to
          some owner's meeting. What do you
          think that's about?

          MONIX
          I don't know, but it can't be good.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          Hey, let's see that championship
          ring, Monix.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Yeah, you promised we could see the
          ice.
          Monix takes the ring out. It hangs from his neck.

          MONIX
          Look at this piece. It says Celtics
          right there in diamonds.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Why don't you wear it on your
          finger?

          MONIX
          I don't know, I just like to wear
          it around my neck, that's all.
          NOW CLARENCE chimes in without looking over...

          CLARENCE
          Not everyone sits around dreaming
          of playing in the NBA, you know.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Maybe not. But you do.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          Yeah, that's all you ever talk
          about.

          MONIX
          You're not jealous, are you
          Clarence?

          CLARENCE
          No one calls me Clarence.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          His name's Downtown.

          MONIX
          Okay Downtown. I'll make sure
          Downtown is only referred to as
          Downtown, okay Downtown?

          CLARENCE
          Don't think I don't know what
          you're doing. You're doing that
          thing where you pretend to mean
          what you say, but you don't.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Sarcasm.

          CLARENCE
          Yeah. How'd you like that sarcasm
          smacked off your face?

          MONIX
          Bring it, funky stuff.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          That's sarcasm, man. He's doing it
          again!

          CLARENCE
          (to Bee Bee)
          I got this, alright?
          Monix squares off with a smile that says 'hit me.' Clarence
          takes off his leather full length and folds it nicely.

          CLARENCE
          (in Monix's face)
          How'd you like a knuckle sandwich?

          

          

          

          

          26.

          MONIX
          Knuckle sandwich? Who says that?

          CLARENCE
          I do motherfucker. I'm gonna pound
          you so hard, you're--
          MONIX REARS HIS FIST BACK, about to release a strong Popeye

          HOOK--

          CLARENCE

          WAIT!

          CLARENCE IMMEDIATELY SWITCHES GEARS, PUTTING HIS HANDS UP

          LIKE A SCARED LITTLE GIRL.

          CLARENCE
          (like a sissy)

          --WAIT! OKAY? COOL COOL COOL. CHILL

          OUT, MAN, ALRIGHT? WE'RE COOL--

          BAM. MONIX PUNCHES CLARENCE IN THE STOMACH ANYWAY.

          BEE BEE ELLIS

          YESSS! I LIKE IT! IT'S OUR OWN

          TEAM, BUT I LIKE IT.
          One of the party people, a ball girl, GAYLE, interrupts.

          GAYLE
          Excuse me boys. You mind, if I
          borrow your friend for a minute?

          INT. DANCE FLOOR - MEANWHILE

          Jackie is dancing to his own song, still wearing the ice
          packs on his knees. The song ends and A DIFFERENT ONE STARTS.

          JACKIE MOON
          (looking to the DJ)
          Hold on a second.

          MELINDA
          What's wrong?

          JACKIE MOON
          Where's the boogie?
          Jackie fights his way through the crowd to the DJ booth.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to DJ, over music)

          HEY! WHERE'S THE BOOGIE?

          

          

          

          

          27.

          DJ

          I ALREADY PLAYED YOUR SONG FOUR

          TIMES.

          JACKIE MOON

          GET UP.

          DJ

          NO. YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS,

          JACKIE. I'M THE DJ.

          JACKIE MOON
          (taking over as DJ)

          NOT ANY MORE. YOU'RE ON SNACK

          PATROL.
          SCREECH -- The music stops.

          JACKIE MOON
          (into the mic)
          The year was 1973. A young musician
          named Jackie Moon, finishes years
          of musical training, only to find
          he is a slave to the notes on the
          page. He knows it's time to break
          free. In a sudden fit of creative
          mastery, he grabs a pen and a
          napkin and writes a song that
          breaks all the rules. Ladies and
          gentleman... Let's get sweaty.
          MUSIC CUE: Jackie's song. Everyone goes crazy.

          JACKIE MOON (V.0.)
          (studio version)
          Baby, who wants to; love me sexy.
          baby, are you ready to; lick me
          sexy. Take off your shoes and; suck
          me sexy. Baby, we're naked and
          we're; humping sexy--

          INT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - NIGHT

          Gayle and Monix walk upstairs into the 'coolest' room ever.
          Carpet on the ceiling, a plaid couch, a fish tank, a water
          bed, mirrors, etc.

          GAYLE
          I'm glad they traded for you, I got
          myself a cute one.

          MONIX
          So, this is the Daiquiri room?

          

          

          

          

          28.

          LUCY MOON (O.S. )
          That's right.
          REVEAL: LUCY MOON, Jackie's wife, is on the couch. She's the
          hottest girl in the world.

          LUCY MOON
          What do you think, Gayle? Does he
          like it with my boots on, or does
          he like my boots off?

          GAYLE
          He seems like a boots on kind of
          guy.

          LUCY MOON
          Then it looks like I'm ready. As
          soon as you slide these shorts off
          of me.

          MONIX
          Aren't you Jackie's wife?

          LUCY MOON
          He knows about the Daiquiri room.

          GAYLE
          It's a new tradition we're
          starting, when new players join.

          MONIX
          I see. Well, I'm going to have to
          pass. I'm good, thanks.

          LUCY MOON
          Honey, you don't know what good is.
          With that, Lucy flicks on the stereo--

          MUSIC CUE: THE BAR KEYS 'TOO HOT TO STOP.'

          MONIX
          Listen um...
          (i.e. what's your name?)

          GAYLE
          My name is 'no strings attached.'

          LUCY MOON
          You can call me Mrs. Moon.
          Gayle and Lucy perform a funky/seductive dance, moving closer
          and closer to Monix.

          

          

          

          

          29.

          MONIX
          I don't think this is going to
          happen, Mrs. Moon.

          LUCY MOON
          It has to.

          GAYLE
          It's bad luck if you don't.

          MONIX
          Yeah, I'd hate to bring bad luck to
          Flint Michigan.
          Lucy has sprayed some WHIP CREAM on her nipples.

          LUCY MOON
          (whip cream)
          Why don't you lick these clean for
          me?

          MONIX
          I can't eat dairy.
          Lucy decides that now is a good time to aggressively KISS
          him. Monix pushes her away.

          MONIX
          Nice tits, Mrs. Moon. I gotta go.
          Monix walks down the stairs.

          LUCY MOON
          (calling after him)
          I see what this is: You want us to
          send Eric and Marcus up here?
          On the way out, Monix flicks her off.

          INT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Lynn is asleep next to Kyle. She awakes to someone pounding
          on the door.

          EXT. LYNN'S FRONT YARD - NIGHT

          Lynn has arrived at the screen door. Monix, wasted, doesn't
          notice Lynn yet, he keeps pounding until she opens it.

          LYNN
          Why are you here?

          

          

          

          

          30.

          MONIX
          I got traded.

          LYNN
          I mean, why are you here?

          MONIX
          Can we talk?

          KYLE (O.S.)
          --Yo, Monix, you're wasted! Ha!
          Kyle has come out to say hi.

          MONIX
          Yeah. Sorry man--

          KYLE
          What's up! That of jump shot of
          yours ain't broke yet, is it?

          MONIX
          No. Ha.

          KYLE
          Great back door cut for the lay-up
          in the third. That's how basketball
          should be played.

          MONIX
          Kyle, can you give us a second? We
          need to talk.

          KYLE
          No problem. Great game tonight man.

          MONIX
          Why does your boyfriend like me so
          much?

          LYNN
          You're his favorite player.

          MONIX
          Look, there are still some things I
          think we need to talk about.

          LYNN
          I've already said everything I'm
          ever going to say to you.

          

          

          

          

          31.

          MONIX
          I see.

          (BEAT)
          Well, I guess I'll be leaving then.
          Monix walks away... Then turns back.

          MONIX
          You're really not going to stop me?

          LYNN
          No.
          Monix walks more, until Lynn speaks.

          LYNN
          You're going to end up walking with
          a cane the rest of your life. You
          have to quit.

          MONIX
          And do what?

          LYNN
          I don't know... Kill yourself, I
          guess.

          MONIX
          Kill myself?

          LYNN
          You act like there's nothing else
          in the world besides basketball. If
          that's how you really feel, then go
          ahead and get it over with. I'm
          going to sleep.

          MONIX
          Thanks for the pep. talk.

          LYNN
          No problem.

          MONIX
          Lynn.
          (she opens the door again)
          Can I ask you for one favor?

          LYNN
          You want a favor?

          MONIX
          My knee.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          LYNN
          Oh, Jesus Christ Monix. It's 4 a.m.
          Lynn stares at him in disbelief. Monix shrugs.

          MONIX
          No one here can drain it right.

          LYNN
          Fine.
          Monix nods, then makes a move toward the door.

          LYNN
          No. You're not coming in. We'll do
          it in the yard.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. JACKIE'S MONTE CARLO - DAYS LATER

          Jackie drives in his car, practicing for the meeting. tries
          to build some confidence.

          JACKIE MOON
          (into the rear view, very

          CIVILIZED)
          Well, hello Commissioner -- Why
          sure, I would love one of your
          Puerto Rican cigars -- Oh, I know
          I'm a legitimate owner, you don't
          have to tell me that -- We're
          merging with the NBA? Oh, that's
          nice -- Ha Ha Ha! Good one,
          Commish ...

          EXT. INDIANAPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

          A brick building on the outskirts of Indianapolis. A sign
          says. WELCOME ABA OWNERS. Jackie pulls into the lot and
          parks. He looks in the mirror one last time.

          JACKIE MOON
          Your Mom would be proud of you
          today.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Not-quite-Rich guys surround a large oak table. JACKIE is by
          far the youngest of the owners.

          

          

          

          

          33.

          COMMISH
          .I'm sure each of you have heard
          the rumors. And I'm here to tell
          you, the rumors are true. The ABA
          will be merging with the NBA at the
          end of this season.

          JACKIE MOON

          YES!!!
          (to an old guy)

          GIVE ME TEN, NORTON! YES!!
          (fists to the ceiling)

          EVERYONE CAN EAT SHIT! I AM THE

          GREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD!

          COMMISH
          Our league is sold. And the NBA
          agreed to all of our financial
          demands!
          Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly intense. This is,
          without question, the greatest moment of his life.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to himself)
          You're a real owner. You're in the

          NBA.

          COMMISH
          Four of our teams will be absorbed
          into the NBA family, the rest of
          you will terminate operations.

          JACKIE MOON
          Exactly! You know it!
          (now hearing)
          I'm sorry, wait, what?

          COMMISH
          The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs
          and the Pacers will play in the NBA
          next year. The rest of us will
          dissolve.

          JACKIE MOON
          Dissolve? Dissolve, like, how? How
          do I dissolve into the NBA?
          The winning owners look at each other, not sure how to handle
          Jackie.

          JACKIE MOON
          What's happening?

          COMMISH
          I'm sorry Jackie. We all know how.
          emotional you get. We waited until
          the very last second to tell you.
          Jackie pounds the table.

          JACKIE MOON
          No. NO! NO!!!
          He kicks over his chair...

          THE COMMISH
          We know you're upset, Jackie. But
          you'll be very well compensated.

          LOSING OWNER #1
          Everyone's agreed to a very large
          sum.

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't want a sum! I want my team!
          (to the losing owners)
          C'mon you guys, you're not going to
          just sit here and take the money,
          are you?
          They are.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to winning owners)
          What do the Spurs have that we
          don't?

          THE COMMISH
          A huge fan base. A brand new
          stadium. A solid economic growth
          package, including strong tax
          incentives.

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh, c'mon, that's BULLSHIT!

          COMMISH
          The NBA is taking four teams,
          Jackie, there's nothing I can do.
          Jackie goes quiet, thinking... An epic idea hits him.

          JACKIE MOON
          The best four teams should go.

          

          

          

          

          35.

          COMMISH
          What?

          JACKIE MOON
          Forget the huge fan base, the
          stadiums, the economic...
          (a little lost)
          Growing... package... inventions...

          WINNING OWNER #1
          (correcting him)
          Economic growth pack--

          JACKIE MOON

          I KNOW WHAT I SAID!
          (to the room)
          The four teams with the best
          records should merge.

          LOSING OWNER #2
          He's right.

          LOSING OWNER #1
          Yeah, that's the fairest way.

          COMMISH
          These four teams DO have the best
          records. Flint's only won six games
          all year!

          JACKIE MOON
          So far. The season isn't over.

          LOSING OWNER #2
          Yeah, maybe we should finish the
          season first.

          COMMISH
          This plan sounds like a lot of fun,
          but it's too late. The
          commissioner, me, has already
          decided.

          LOSING OWNER #2
          Actually, the terms of a merger can
          only be approved by a league
          mandate.

          JACKIE MOON
          YES. That's right. What he said.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          LOSING OWNER #1
          I move that we vote on the terms of
          the merger.

          EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NEXT DAY

          The team sits around the parking lot, sitting on their duffle
          bags, dejected. Jackie is having a team meeting.

          JACKIE MOON
          C'mon you guys, let's try to stay
          psyched. This is a chance to become
          a real NBA franchise!

          CLARENCE
          There's no way we can make it to
          fourth place. It's mathematically
          impossible.

          JACKIE MOON
          I ran the numbers. All we have to
          do is win about eighty-two percent
          of our remaining games.

          CLARENCE
          Eighty-two percent? Isn't that a
          lot?

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh, c'mon! We just gotta start
          hitting our threes.
          (guys look around, unsure)
          Listen, I know this seems like bad
          news, but it doesn't have to be.
          This is a big road trip for us.
          We've just got to start playing
          solid Flint basketball.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          I don't know. We suck, man.

          JACKIE SLAPS SCOOTSIE.

          JACKIE MOON
          (re: The slap)
          Sorry.

          JACKIE SLAPS HIM AGAIN, HARDER.

          JACKIE MOON
          We do not suck, okay? We just have
          to want it!

          

          

          

          

          37.
          Pumped, Jackie walks around with his hands on his hips.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          What do you think, Monix?
          All eyes turn on the grumpy one.

          MONIX
          I think we suck.

          JACKIE MOON
          Well... See, now there's some team
          unity! Now let's load up the jet.
          REVEAL: A SHITTY SCHOOL BUS has the words 'THE JET!' Spray-
          painted in graffiti letters with a palm tree next to it.

          JACKIE MOON
          (as they load up)
          Now we've got a special treat. You
          know I take care of my family.
          Today, the Jet is catered. I had
          Downtown's Mom pack us some hot
          dish.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Ms. Quincy's hot dish? Sweet!

          INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

          The guys load up. It's so packed it's ridiculous. Everyone
          tries to stuff their gear somewhere and sit down.
          Jackie carries a big pot of hot dish, accidentally burning
          Scootsie's back.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Ah, watch the hot dish, man.

          JACKIE MOON
          Sorry Scootsie.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          Hey Jackie, there's some dude out
          there, wants to talk to you.
          POV: Out the window, we can see DUKES, the full court shot
          winner, holding his GIANT CHECK and looking into the bus.
          He's still shirtless, with a star-spangled headband.

          EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jackie and Dukes are next to the bus, discussing the check.

          

          

          

          

          38.

          DUKES
          I tried Jackie. They won't take it.
          They said it's 'symbolic.'

          JACKIE MOON
          What does symbolic mean?

          DUKES
          I don't know. But they said I need
          a real check.

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't know what your bank is
          talking about. That is a real
          check. I signed it myself.

          DUKES
          It's written in glitter, dude.
          Can't you just give me, like, a
          regular sized one?

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't get it. People are usually
          able to cash these. Maybe you
          should try another bank.
          (trying to wrap it up)
          If you run into any more trouble,
          let me know.

          DUKES
          Okay Jackie, thanks man.

          JACKIE MOON
          Any time, congratulations.
          Jackie turns away from Dukes and exhales, walking back to the
          bus.

          MUSIC CUE: 'SHORT PEOPLE' BY RANDY NEWMAN.

          EXT. THE HIGHWAY - DAY

          We're flying down the highway.

          INT. THE JET - DAY

          Kong, the small Asian player, is driving, singing along with
          Jackie to the radio...

          JACKIE MOON & KONG
          (singing Randy Newman)

          SHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON...

          

          

          

          

          39.

          SHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON...

          SHORT PEOPLE GOT, NO REASON TO LIVE
          Jackie reaches up into a special bin and takes out some beef
          jerky, then yells out the window.

          JACKIE
          (out the window at a car)

          YOU IN-THE-GREEN-CAR GOT, NO REASON

          TO LIVE...
          Pan back to see the whole team crammed into tiny seats.
          Vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the ceiling.
          Twiggy Munson is reading '70's pornography. Clarence is
          sewing a new name onto his jersey. The rest of the guys are
          eating their hot dish.

          MONIX
          So, Clarence, what's in this 'hot
          dish' anyway?

          CLARENCE
          My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn
          meal, why you gotta go asking
          what's in it?

          MONIX
          It's a compliment. It's good.

          CLARENCE
          If it's good, then it's good. Why
          do you gotta know what's in it?
          What's in hot dish? Hot dish is in
          hot dish, asshole.
          BEE BEE and SCOOTSIE look over the seat, facing them.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Hey Monix, what were the Celtics
          like?

          MONIX
          They were fast.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Fast? No one's faster than me. I
          should be on the Celtics.

          MONIX
          (pointing to his mind)
          Fast up here.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          You're supposed to be Mr.
          Smartball. Why'd you get bounced?

          MONIX
          Well, you have to be able to jump
          too.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Hey, let us see that ring again.

          MONIX
          Not right now, okay Twiggy?

          CLARENCE
          Isn't it a little embarrassing
          wearing that thing everyday?

          MONIX
          Embarrassing?

          CLARENCE
          You call yourself a Celtic? You sat
          through every single playoff game.
          You didn't see action once. And now
          you walk around wearing the ice
          like you're Bill Russel. Well you
          ain't.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Oh, you're just jealous.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Yeah, Monix played solid minutes,
          for lots of teams. He's played in
          the NBA, that's more than you can
          say.

          CLARENCE
          Whatever. At least I never sat on
          the bench and then called myself a
          champion. You didn't do shit for
          that Celtic team. If I was Dave
          Cowens, I'd yank that ring right
          off your neck.
          That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he's got
          something to say, but he doesn't. Clarence has the last word.

          CLARENCE
          He doesn't wear it on his finger
          because he knows he didn't earn it.
          He didn't even play.

          

          

          

          

          41.
          Monix looks out the window.

          EXT. ROAD GAME #1 - NIGHT

          'The Jet' is parked outside the arena.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          We're just a few minutes away from
          game one of the Tropic's 6 game
          road trip. With talk of an NBA
          merger hitting the league, there's
          a new electricity surrounding
          tonight's game...

          INT. VISITOR'S LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          Jackie addresses his team before tip off.

          JACKIE MOON
          Alright. Now, a lot of people out
          there are writing us off. A lot
          people are saying things like
          'Jackie Moon is an offensive
          liability.' They're saying 'Flint's
          turnovers led to sixty fast break
          points per game.'
          (Making this up)
          They're saying 'Bee Bee's retarded
          brother is so retarded that his
          eyes look too big,. Like a French
          Bulldog.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          No one said that, man.

          JACKIE MOON
          (trying to motivate)
          Yes they did. And we're going to
          use it as motivation, okay? THIS IS

          OUR TIME! WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT MORE

          THAN WE'VE EVER SHOT BEFORE! NOW

          BRING IT IN! READY? ONE TWO THREE-

          EVERYONE

          LET'S GET TROPICAL!

          MONTAGE: FLINT PLAYS HARDER BUT THEY STILL SUCK.
          GAME 1) JACKIE MOON sprints across the floor tries to get two
          f eet planted in the lane. It's not even close, JACKIE HAS
          TAKEN A GUY DOWN HARD. The ref whistles a blocking foul.

          

          

          

          

          42.

          JACKIE MOON
          OH, C'MON!? Where's the charge,
          Father Pat?

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          Both feet weren't planted.

          JACKIE MOON

          OH, SUCK MY COCK. I WILL MURDER

          YOUR FAMILY.

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          That's it, you're out.

          JACKIE MOON
          What!? What did I say?
          Jackie takes a ball and drop kicks it, PUNTING IT high up
          into the rafters.

          BUZZER! FINAL SCORE: COLONELS 111 TROPICS 92.
          GAME 2) MONIX drives the lane, fast and smart -- A no-look
          pass hits Scootsie Double-Day in the shoulder.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY

          AH. MY COLLAR BONE!

          BUZZER! FINAL SCORE: SQUIRES 90 TROPICS 70.
          GAME 3) CLARENCE and BEE BEE jog back on Defense.

          CLARENCE
          I ain't guarding my guy anymore.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Why not?

          CLARENCE
          He's too'Damn sweaty, man.
          (re: his wet uniform)
          Look at me.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Gross. Well, I ain't guarding him.
          Monix notices this discussion.

          MONIX
          Quit talking and play defense!
          The sweaty guy backs in on Clarence, posting up top.

          

          

          

          

          44.
          GAME 5) Jackie Moon plays great defense, rejecting a shot!
          Monix grabs the ball and dribbles on a fast break. Clarence
          trails, in perfect position...

          CLARENCE
          Right on! I'm open baby! Try a
          behind-the-back!
          Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but Clarence
          isn't ready for anything fundamentally sound -- The ball hits
          him in the nuts.

          CLARENCE
          Ah, shit.

          BUZZER! FINAL SCORE: PIPERS 105 TROPICS 91.

          EXT. HOTEL STRIP - NIGHT

          Angle on a big hotel with fancy lights -- but then we pan to
          reveal: A shitty motel. The 'Jet' is parked at the cheap
          place.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Two twin beds in a crap-box motel room. Monix has the phone
          to his ear, but it just keeps ringing. He'd leave a message
          for Lynn, but answering machines haven't been invented yet.
          He hangs up, looks in the mirror, and now takes his
          Championship ring necklace off.
          He looks at the ring in his hand... And shoves it into his
          duffle bag.

          CLARENCE (O.S.)
          I brought us some ice.
          Monix is startled. Clarence, his roommate for the night,
          enters.

          MONIX
          Ice? What for?

          CLARENCE
          I don't know, it's free.
          Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts
          crunching.

          CLARENCE
          Want some?

          

          

          

          

          45.

          MONIX
          No thanks.
          Now BEE BEE enters, yet another player in the small room.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          That Root Beer machine took my
          fucking change, man. White people
          are assholes.
          Monix ignores this. Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE
          CELTICS are playing. Their trapping defense is a thing of
          beauty.
          Clarence walks over and flicks the channels, until he stops
          at 'Love American Style.'

          MONIX
          You turned off the Celtics?

          CLARENCE
          I don't watch people play
          basketball. They watch me.
          With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it.

          MONIX
          (re: the marijuana)
          What the Hell is that?

          CLARENCE
          (as he inhales)
          It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin.
          Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his
          face.
          JACKIE EXITS the bathroom, having just taken a shower. He's
          wearing a very small robe. This is now the fourth player
          who's sleeping in this tiny room.

          MONIX
          Why don't you shower in your room?

          JACKIE MOON
          My wife is using it. I'll be
          crashing with you guys tonight.

          (NOTICING)
          Ice? Awesome.
          (as he eats ice, re: TV)
          Love American Style? Turn it up.

          

          

          

          

          46.
          Jackie doesn't say a word about the pot. Instead he keeps his
          eyes glued to the TV, then reaches for the joint and SMOKES

          IT.

          MONIX
          Jackie, have you ever even slept
          with your wife?

          JACKIE MOON

          (LYING)
          What? Are you kidding? Try, like,
          every weekend. She's so hot.

          MONIX
          Sounds like a great arrangement.

          JACKIE MOON
          You guys need to wake up. Quit
          living like it's the 1950's, man.
          Live it up.
          (showing off)
          Hey Clarence, let's have some of
          that smoke, bro.

          MONIX
          I'm pretty sure we have a game
          tomorrow.

          JACKIE MOON
          (as he inhales)
          This stuff won't affect you. It's
          premium.
          Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He
          stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates.

          MONIX
          Well, if this is really going to be
          my life, I might as well be stoned
          like everyone else.

          JACKIE MOON
          Well said.
          Monix takes the stupid joint. The instant Monix inhales he

          COUGHS LIKE CRAZY.

          MONIX
          What the Hell is this?

          CLARENCE
          What do you mean?

          

          

          

          

          47.

          MONIX
          It's harsh.

          CLARENCE
          Take that back.

          MONIX
          Take what back?

          JACKIE MOON
          His Mom grows it.

          CLARENCE
          Yeah, in the yard.

          MONIX
          Your Mom grew this?

          CLARENCE
          It's sweet grass.

          MONIX
          Well, I'm finished, thanks.

          CLARENCE
          What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't
          good enough for you?

          MONIX
          I guess not.

          JACKIE MOON
          C'mon man, have some respect for
          his Mom's weed.

          CLARENCE
          That's it, I ain't sleeping in the
          same bed as this motherfucker.

          INT. AMIGO STADIUM - ROAD TRIP GAME 6 - NEXT NIGHT

          Television cameras are being set up. A camera man cleans the
          lens.
          Jackie studies the cameras, mesmerized by the idea of
          television. He speaks with the Amigo's manager.

          AMIGO MANAGER
          You want all the fans to sit on one
          side of the stadium?

          

          

          

          

          48.

          JACKIE MOON
          Yeah, just move all those people
          over to this side.

          (DEMONSTRATING)
          See, the TV cameras are going to
          face this way, right? Well, if we
          fill the seats on that side, we'll
          look sold out.

          AMIGO MANAGER
          Actually, that's not a bad idea.
          MEANWHILE, ON THE COURT: Both teams are warming up. Clarence
          now has a new name on his Jersey. There are so many words,
          there is barely space for a number. It's a mess.

          CLARENCE
          (re: Jersey, new name)
          Check it out. I sewed it on the
          bus.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          (struggling to read it)
          What's it say?

          CLARENCE
          Jumping Johnny Johnson.
          The asshole, PETRELLI, wanders over near the Tropics side of
          the court.

          PETRELLI
          Yo, Granny Yarn Barn, how's the
          needle point going?

          CLARENCE
          Kiss my ass, Petrelli.

          PETRELLI
          (re: the Jersey name)
          Hey man, I think you spelled 'Flint
          sucks balls' wrong.

          (BEAT)
          This guy's the next Betsy Ross!
          Aren't you Clarence?
          The guys laugh. MONIX walks up, defending his teammate.

          MONIX
          No one calls him Clarence. His name

          IS--

          (BEAT)
          What's your name?

          

          

          

          

          49.

          CLARENCE
          Jumping Johnny Johnson.

          MONIX
          His name's Jumping Johnny Johnson.
          (nose to nose)
          You got that?
          Jackie hurries over.

          JACKIE MOON
          Alright, break it up.
          (to his team)
          Everyone huddle up!... VAKIDIS!
          OVER HERE. Where is he walking to?

          (BEAT)
          Fuck it. Listen up, we're on
          National TV tonight. And you all
          know what that means: The league
          needs a good clean game.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Oh, that's a bunch of dog shit.

          JACKIE MOON
          Hey! You guys want to merge or not?
          Because the fastest way to screw
          this up is to start punching people
          in the face while the commissioner
          is at home, watching the game with
          his kids... Children are very
          impressionable. Their minds are not
          yet soiled by the cruel realities
          of this world.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          What?

          JACKIE MOON
          No punching.
          Behind the huddle, FANS BEGIN WALKING RIGHT ACROSS THE COURT.
          Both teams turn to watch this strange thing.
          The Amigos manager leads the herd, Jackie helps out,
          directing them across to the other side.

          JACKIE MOON

          THAT'S RIGHT, JUST MOVE RIGHT

          ACROSS- IF YOU COULD JUST FILL IN

          ALL OF THOSE EMPTY SEATS IN THAT

          AREA, THAT'D BE GREAT.

          

          

          

          

          50.

          INT. AMIGO'S STADIUM - LATER

          The optical illusion has worked. The game does indeed look
          crowded. The game is in full swing.

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
          This sold out crowd is loving this
          one, the Amigos up by twenty-six
          here in the second.
          Monix drains a nice jumper, but out of nowhere, Petrelli, the
          guy we hate, throws a hard shoulder, knocking Monix to the
          floor.

          MONIX
          That's a moving pick Father Pat!
          C'mon!

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          Play on.
          Monix can't believe it. Petrelli taunts Monix.

          PETRELLI
          What's wrong Monix, cat got your
          'nads?
          Monix faces off.

          JACKIE MOON

          MONIX! NO!

          (POINTING)
          Not with the cameras.
          (miming the commish')
          He's watching.
          Monix looks around and thinks...

          MONIX
          What about commercials?

          JACKIE MOON
          What?

          MONIX
          Commercials, what about
          commercials?
          Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea.'

          JACKIE MOON
          I like it. Time out Ref!

          

          

          

          

          51.

           ANNOUNCER (V.0. )
           A time out on the floor, 5:20 left
           before the half, the Amigos 45, the
          Tropics 19, we'll be right back
          after this message from Shasta.
          The camera's on air' red light turns off.

          CAMERA MAN
          (rooting them on)
          And... You're clear.

          JACKIE MOON

          SOMEBODY HIT SOMEBODY!

          BAM! MONIX CLOCKS PETRELLI.

          BAM! JACKIE MOON PUNCHES ANOTHER GUY.

          PETRELLI TAKES THE HIT AND TACKLES MONIX.

          BOTH BENCHES CLEAR. THE CROWD GOES NUTS.

          INT. THE COMMISSIONER'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE

          The commissioner relaxes at home with his two kids... A
          Shasta commercial is on TV.

           SHASTA COMMERCIAL (V.0.)
          (on TV)
          I want a pop... I want a --
          Shasta...

          INT. AMIGO STADIUM - CONTINUOUS


          MAYHEM. JACKIE MOON IS YANKING A FAN'S HAIR.

          A TALL GUY IS ABOUT TO POUND SHORT LITTLE KONG. BUT NOW KONG

          JUMPS IN THE AIR AND DOES A SWEET ROUND-HOUSE JUDO KICK,

          KNOCKING THE TALL GUY TO THE FLOOR.

          KONG
          Hi-Ya!

          MEANWHILE: MONIX AND PETRELLI ARE TRADING HOCKEY PUNCHES...

          And we're back in -5-

          -2-
          (Monix ducks and punches)
          (cuing the announcers)

          AND WE'RE ON.

          THE 'RED LIGHT' GLOWS.

          ON A DIME: EVERYONE STOPS PUNCHING, STANDS UP STRAIGHT AND

          SMILES.

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
          Welcome back to the ABA game of the
          week...
          Players hold their heads in pain. Others limp back to the
          bench.

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
          .The camaraderie and spirit of
          this league is on full display here
          tonight...
          Off camera, Monix delivers a secret punch to Patrelli's
          spleen.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME

          Jackie runs the half time talk, standing in front of the
          chalk board.

          JACKIE MOON
          Okay, solid first half guys, but
          we're going to have to make some

          ADJ--
          Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses the team,
          stepping in front of Jackie Moon.

          MONIX
          --This is bullshit guys. They're
          kicking our ass in basketball and
          they're kicking our ass during the
          commercials, too. Does anybody here
          understand the concept of the pick
          and roll? Because they're going to
          keep double teaming at the top of
          the key until somebody rotates the
          Damn ball...

          JACKIE MOON
          Yeah! C'mon guys! Rotate the ball.
          Monix looks at this group and gets even madder.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          MONIX
          Does anyone in this room have any
          pride? Don't you realize, this is
          thelast four weeks of basketball
          anyus are ever going to play?Is
          thishow we're really going togo
          out?You'd think we'd want toend
          ourcareers battling, hustling
          after every loose ball. Boxing out
          under the boards. Setting picks for
          our teammates. But we haven't done
          shit out there.
          Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads.

          MONIX
          We're a bunch of selfish assholes --
          And I've got news for you, we
          aren't going to finish in fourth,
          we're going to finish dead last.
          Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed.

          MONIX
          One day, you're going to look back
          on your life... And you're going to
          look back on this time... And
          you're going to realize...
          Monix is staring right at Clarence. And Clarence is actually
          listening...

          MONIX
          .You're going to realize you
          never even played basketball.
          A moment of silence after the intensity. Monix waddles to the
          door.

          MONIX
          Now, you guys have fun out there in
          the second half. If anyone needs
          me, I'll be in the training room,
          draining my knee.
          Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          He's right.

          

          

          

          

          54.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Of course he's right. But what the
          Hell are we supposed to do about
          it? We don't even have plays.

          INT. JACKIE MOON'S OFFICE - DAYS LATER

          We're back in Flint. Jackie is back in his office, speaking
          on the phone.

          JACKIE MOON
          (into phone)
          Dukes! I don't make the rules. If
          they can't cash it, maybe you'll
          have to go out of state.

          (BEAT)
          I would if I could, but if I give
          you another check, that would be
          two checks. That would be $20,000,
          not ten. What are you trying to
          pull here?
          (the other line rings)
          I've got to take this other call
          Dukes. Bye!--
          (hits a button, answering)
          Flint Tropics hot line... Oh hey
          Commish ...

          INT. FLINT MICHIGAN TROPICS STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

          On the floor, instead of a basketball court, the stadium
          holds an ice-rink. A 'Welcome to the Flint Ice Capades' sign
          is being removed.
          The entire basketball team is on their hands and knees
          ASSEMBLING THE HARD WOOD. This is a lot of work. Clarence
          hits his thumb with a hammer.

          CLARENCE
          Why do we have to put the court
          together?

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          I guess the Ice Capades sold out.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Yeah, kids love that stuff.
          Although, I find the wild-life
          masks realistic and frightening.

          CLARENCE
          Monix should be here helping us.

          

          

          

          

          55.

          JACKIE MOON (O.S. )
          Guys.
          The guys look up to find Jackie. He does not look happy.

          JACKIE MOON
          The commissioner just called.

          CLARENCE
          What's wrong?

          JACKIE MOON
          I looks like we've got ourselves a
          situation. We've got some new
          'terms and conditions' for this
          merger deal.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          What'd he say?

          JACKIE MOON
          Basically, we've got to average at
          least 2,000 fans per home game for
           the rest of the year.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          2,000 people? Every home game?

          JACKIE MOON
          He said the NBA will only take a
          franchise that has fans.

          CLARENCE
          Shit. Winning is going to be hard.
          But getting 2,000 people to watch
          is going to be impossible.

          JACKIE MOON
          Let's try and stay positive. My
          Mother always believed Flint was a
          town of destiny. And I believe
          that. Now, I've already started
          work on a huge idea to promote us.

          CLARENCE
          What kind of huge idea?

          INT. THE KREMLIN - DAY

          Jackie's place is empty. Monix is drinking alone, totally
          blasted in the middle of the day. He hangs his head, barely
          able to order.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          MONIX
          Two more Johnny Walkers. And
          another pack of Kools.

          BARTENDER
          You could use some fresh air,
          Monix. You want to take a nap in
          the back of my truck?

          MONIX

          (ANGRY)
          Just the drinks and the smokes,
          alright?

          (BEAT)
          Do you have any idea where Lynn is
          these days?

          BARTENDER
          She asked me to tell you to quit
          going to her house.

          MONIX
          Well, tell her that's just fine
          with me.

          BARTENDER
          Okay. Sorry man.

          CLARENCE (O.S. )
          Monix.
          REVEAL: Clarence.

          MONIX
          Well, well, well, look who it is.
          (to the bartender)
          Brian, I'd like you to meet Jumping
          Johnny Downtown Funky stuff Boner-
          time finger-blast Fag-erton.

          CLARENCE
          (to the bartender)
          Johnny for short.
          (to Brian, re: Monix)
          Two coffees.

          MONIX
          So, what brings you to the The
          Kremlin?

          CLARENCE
          Listen, I know you and I haven't
          always been the best of buddies.

          

          

          

          

          57.
          But I've been thinking about what
          you said the other night. This is
          gonna be our last chance. If I'm
          ever going to get into the NBA,
          it's going to be with the Tropics.

          MONIX
          I hate to break it to you,
          Clarence, but the Tropics will
          never play in the NBA.

          CLARENCE
          So maybe we won't. But like you
          said, I don't want to look back on
          this with any regrets. I know what
          you think of me. But I'm willing to
          put our differences aside. I'm
          telling you right now, I'll do
          whatever it takes to win.

          MONIX
          You mean, like, pass?

          CLARENCE
          (with a smile)
          I would consider passing, yes.

          MONIX
          Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play
          harder, this knee won't let me.

          CLARENCE
          I'm not just talking about you
          playing point guard... I'm talking
          about you teaching us...
          Monix could not be less interested.

          CLARENCE
          Monix, you know more about
          basketball than any man who's ever
          set foot in Flint.
          Monix drinks, not into it...

          CLARENCE
          All I'm saying is, instead of
          getting so pissed off at us all the
          time, why not just show us what the
          Hell you're talking about? Coach us
          a little. I mean, we can't get any
          worse.

          

          

          

          

          58.

          MONIX
          And why should I give a shit about
          the Tropics?

          CLARENCE
          I know you. You've got all that
          basketball shit stored up in your
          head. I know you're dying to pass
          it down to somebody. Why not us?

          MONIX
          What about Jackie? He's the coach.

          CLARENCE
          Jackie's got his hands full, trying
          to sell tickets. He's obsessed.
          (looking up, re: TV)

          HEY! IT'S OUR VIDEO! TURN THE SOUND

          UP!

          ECU: THE TROPIC'S VIDEO ON TELEVISION.
          ON TV: The Tropics are performing a video not unlike 'The
          Super Bowl shuffle.' Each member takes a turn rapping,
          dancing around wooden palm trees with a smile.

          ALL THE TROPICS (V.0.)
          (rapping badly)
          We are the Tropics hooping crew,
          running and gunning and dunking on
          you -- But we're not here to talk
          no trash, we're just here to do the
          Tropical Mash --
          This is the worst video ever made. All the guys boogie around
          until Clarence steps forward, taking focus...

          CLARENCE (V.0.)
          (rapping badly)
          I'm Johnny Johnson and I got the
          moves -- If you try and stop me,
          I'll just get smooth --

          KONG (V.0.)
          (rapping badly)
          My name is Kong and I ain't five
          feet -- But I get more ass than a
          toilet seat --

          JACKIE MOON (V.O.)
          This is my team, so get to know
          them -- If you get near the lane
          I'll yank your scrotum --

          we're just here to do the Tropical

           The ball girls trot out and boogie with them.

          CUT BACK TO:
          MONIX CAN'T BELIEVE HIS EYES. Either can the bartender. Monix
          ignores Clarence.

          MONIX
          (to the bartender)
          Two more Johnny Walkers.

          CLARENCE
          So that's the way it's going to be?
          Monix doesn't answer, he just drinks. Clarence gets the hint
          and walks out.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. MONIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Monix looks like shit, laying on the couch, as if he hasn't
          moved for days. Apparently he's been drinking and smoking,
          but not much else.
          KNOCK KNOCK. Someone's at the door.
          REVEAL: LYNN lets herself in.
          Monix is so depressed, he is non-plused.

          LYNN
          Looking good Monix.

          MONIX
          Thanks. You too.

          LYNN
          Ms. Quincy told me the Tropics
          asked you to coach them.

          INT. MONIX'S BATHROOM - LATER


          ECU: A SHARP NEEDLE PIERCES FLESH.
          Lynn is draining Monix's knee. It looks painful.

          MONIX
          I know what it takes to be a real
          team, Lynn.

          LYNN
          (re: his knee)
          Stay still.

          (BEAT)
          And that's the reason you won't
          coach them?

          MONIX
          It doesn't matter. The truth is, I
          hate basketball right now.

          LYNN
          Do you really hate basketball? Or
          do you hate yourself?

          MONIX
          Why would I hate myself?

          LYNN
          Well, for one, you cheated on me.

          MONIX
          You hate me for that. Not me.
          Lynn just stares at him.

          MONIX
          Okay, maybe I hate myself a little.

          LYNN
          You don't wear the ring around your
          neck anymore.
          (no response)
          Where is it?

          MONIX
          I rode the bench through the
          playoffs, Lynn.

          LYNN
          Monix, that was greatest moment of
          your career. And you look back on
          it like some kind of embarrassment.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          MONIX
          Riding the bench was the greatest
          moment of my career?

          LYNN
          You did more than ride the bench,
          Monix.

          MONIX
          What else did I do?

          LYNN
          Every practice, you took your team
          to the limit. I know you did. I was
          the one draining this stupid knee
          of yours every night. The Celtics
          were practicing against you, Monix.
          And when you ran that scout team,
          you were running Milwaukee's
          offense better than their first
          stringers ever could.
          Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the
          toilet and preparing another syringe.

          LYNN
          By game time, your team knew where
          Milwaukee was going to be before
          their own players did. The Celtics
          made the right adjustments to win
          that series. And those adjustments
          came from you.

          MONIX
          So, I should be proud of running
          the scout team?

          LYNN
          Dave Cowens put that ring in the
          palm of your hand. And he told you
          to wear it with pride, because you
          were a champion. And he meant it
          too.

          MONIX
          He was being a nice guy. The bench
          is the bench.

          LYNN
          Your whole life, you've bitched
          about people playing selfish. It
          takes a team to win, right?

          

          

          

          

          62.

          MONIX
          That's right.

          LYNN
          But when you're on the team, your
          effort doesn't count? Is that it?

          (BEAT)
          If you weren't on the Celtics that
          year, would they have won it?

          MONIX
          Watch that needle.

          LYNN
          Answer me. Would they have won?

          MONIX
          I don't know.

          LYNN
          Yes you do. You know.
          Monix looks away for a moment.

          MONIX
          Why are you doing this? What does
          any of this matter, anyway?

          LYNN
          What's it matter? You're drinking
          yourself to death!

          (BEAT)
          God, I wish I hated you as much as
          you hate yourself!
          Lynn throws the needle. Monix dodges it.

          LYNN
          I made sacrifices! How many years
          did I support you? And finally,
          after all of our blood and sweat
          and bullshit together, you got
          there, Monix! You made it, you won
          an NBA championship ring. It wasn't
          just about you, okay? And I'm sick
          of you acting like you're some kind
          of joke. You didn't blow it. You're
          not a fraud. You're not a fake
          champion. And all the time we spent
          together, fighting for you to get
          to that moment, was not a waste!
          You're a champion, you asshole!

          (BEAT)

          

          

          

          

          63.
          But if you want to drink yourself
          to death, go ahead. Fuck you.
          With that, Lynn is gone. Monix stands alone in the bathroom,
          then checks his knee.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLISEUM - NEXT DAY

          It's practice. But this isn't basketball, it's DANCE
          PRACTICE. The entire team performs a complicated 'intro-
          dance.'

          JACKIE MOON

          (CHOREOGRAPHING)
          1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and turn like
           you mean it -- Bee Bee, Arch that
          back. Yes. Now, the waterfall...
          One by one, each dips down like a waterfall. And now a leg
          kick.

          JACKIE MOON
          Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible
          hips are a coach's dream.

          (BEAT)
          Now big finish -- and freeze. And
          then we start the game after that.

          CLARENCE
          Are we going to practice or what?

          JACKIE MOON
          This is practice, okay Clarence? We
          need to get two thousand people in
          here! Our intro dance has to blow
          people's minds.
          He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever...

          JACKIE MOON
          From now on, I want our afros
          bigger... And shinier ... . I want
          our shorts shorter... And
          tighter... We're going to pull our
          tube socks up higher than we ever
          have before.
          The team seems to be looking off screen.

          JACKIE MOON
          What's wrong?

          

          

          

          

          64.
          REVEAL: Monix has been watching this whole thing. With Monix
          on the court, everyone feels kind of stupid.

          JACKIE MOON
          Hey, you're back! Listen, you
          should probably chalk your hands up
          for this number.

          CLARENCE
          Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us.

          JACKIE MOON
          Coach?
          Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the
          team. Clearly, a decision has been made.

          JACKIE MOON
          What do you mean, coach?
          (truly hurt)
          What is this? What's going on?
          (staring his team down)
          It's a Mutiny.

          CLARENCE
          Jackie. Don't be like that.

          JACKIE MOON
          Hold on a second. Last time I
          checked, we didn't live in Flint,
          Russia. We live in Flint, America.
          I'm coach until a new one is
          elected.

          CLARENCE
          Don't make us elect Monix, man.
          (Jackie Moon holds firm)
          Alright, show of hands. Who wants
          Monix to step in as player-coach?
          Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands.

          JACKIE MOON
          Please God No.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          Sorry Jackie.

          JACKIE MOON
          (starting to cry)
          It's cool. I get it. I'm a big boy,
          I can handle it.

          

          

          

          

          65.
          Jackie cries harder.

          CLARENCE
          Don't take it so hard, Jackie.
          You're a great owner. We all know
          that.

          JACKIE MOON
          Woah. Hold on. Did you just say
          'great owner?'

          CLARENCE
          Yeah. Everyone thinks so.

          JACKIE MOON
          Now, when you said great owner,
          were you just saying that? Because
          it's not cool to mess with me about
          this.

          CLARENCE
          We mean it. For real. Monix is just
          more of an X's and O's kind of guy,
          that's all.
          Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off
          his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle.

          JACKIE MOON
          (re: The whistle)
          Here. You may need this.
          Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper
          written in ball point pen. The pages look insane.

          JACKIE MOON
          (handing him papers)
          And here are some ideas for plays
          I've jotted down. Just thoughts.

          MONIX
          Thanks Jackie.
          (to the team)
          The way I see it, any team in this
          league can put together a run. Most
          of our opponents are all flash. If
          we play unselfish, fundamental
          basketball, we can win games.

          JACKIE MOON
          I like it. Unselfish, guys.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          MONIX
          Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning
          tough team defense, full and half
          court traps, boxing your man out to
          help the team rebound.

          (BEAT)
          Unselfish means sprinting up the
          floor on every fast break NOT
          because you can get a DUNK -- and
          get your DICK SUCKED after the game
          -- but because if you sprint up the
          floor you might pull the defense
          out of position and free a teammate
          up for a high percentage shot.

          JACKIE MOON
          Wait, so, what's going on with the
          blow jobs?

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          I vote we keep the blow jobs.

          JACKIE MOON
          (raising his hand)
          All in favor?
          Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs.

          CLARENCE
          Would everyone let the man talk
          please?
          Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up.

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER

          The starters have gotten into position, guarded by the scout
          team, in blue jerseys.

          MONIX
          The most important work we do on
          the court is away from the
          basketball.
          Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL,
          deflating it. This gets everyone's attention.

          MONIX
          (re: deflated ball)
          Until you start moving like a real
          team, you practice without a ball.

          He flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the
          knife closed.

          MONIX
          Alright, Clarence, run the offense.

          CLARENCE
          I don't get it.

          MONIX
          Set a pick for somebody.
          Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.

          MONIX
          Okay, that's kind of a pick, I
          guess. Try standing on the other
          side of Scootsie's man, so you free
          him up to cut into the lane.
          Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him
          to stand.

          MONIX
          Widen your stance. Plant your feet.
          Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie
          GO. Set a pick for Jackie.
          Scootsie cuts across the lane. The team slowly gets i
          rotating faster.

          MONIX
          Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and
          rotate to the rim like this...
          Everyone move to the open space.
          And Clarence you swing back out up
          top.
          They've completed the play. Monix stands there, smiling. The
          players look at each other, what's the big deal?

          MONIX
          You know what that was?

          CLARENCE
          What.

          MONIX
          A flash to the high side post with
          an outside screen and a back door
          cut. Let's do it again.

          

          

          

          
          Ei 8.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Hey, how come you don't have to run
          with us? You're a player, just like
          the rest of us.

          MONIX
          I'm saving my knee for the games.
          Coach's decision. NOW RUN.
          Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the same
          basic rotation.

          MONIX
          (as they run)
          We're not just rotating, we're
          clearing out, making space. A pass
          and cut can change defensive match-
          ups. Creating seams can give us
          back door looks. Down screens can
          make a team vulnerable to
          penetration.

          JACKIE MOON
          Hold on. I'm lost.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          No shit. What's up with all of
          these fucked up words, man?

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          Yeah, what are we, building some
          kind of basketball space. ship?

          MONIX
          You don't have to understand it
          yet. Just run it again. You heard
          me -- AGAIN.

          EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - DAY - LATER

          It's many hours later...

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER

          The team is still doing the exact same thing. Nothing in
          their moves have changed at all. They're exhausted.

          CLARENCE
          We've been running this play for a
          long time, man.

          

          

          

          

          69.

          JACKIE MOON
          Yeah, maybe we could try, like,
          play number two.

          MONIX
          No. We're running this play. We're
          running this play until we puke.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Basically, we have.

          JACKIE MOON
          Yeah, I'm pretty beat.

          MONIX
          'Until we puke' is not a figure of
          speech. We are literally going to
          puke.

          JACKIE MOON
          What does he mean by 'literally?'

          CLARENCE
          I think he's talking about vomit.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Not cool.

          JACKIE MOON
          Monix, can I talk to you for .a
          second?

          MONIX
          No. No talking.

          JACKIE MOON
          Wait...

          MONIX

          GO!
          Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his fate. He runs.

          MONIX
          (as they run)
          We need to get in shape fellas. And
          we need to learn some fundamentals
          quick. -- AGAIN!
          They run it again, getting more and more winded.

          

          

          

          

          -17 0 .

          MONIX
          I want you to be brain dead.
          Because someday you're going to be
          too tired, or too nervous to think -
          - AGAIN! And when you are, this is
          the play I'm going to call. The
          play that your lungs and legs will
          have memorized. We will be able to
          run this in our sleep.
          Clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers.

          MONIX
          HEY! No sticking your fingers down
          your throat, Clarence, I saw that.
          You're going to puke. And it's
          going to be all natural -- AGAIN!

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

          We pan along a row of toilet stalls. Behind the doors, each
          player is throwing up...

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS

          JACKIE IS THE LAST PLAYER LEFT. He crawls across the gym
          floor, dying. Monix screams down at his deflated body.

          MONIX

          MOVE MOVE MOVE! FOURTH QUARTER NOW!

          FOURTH QUARTER!

          JACKIE MOON
          You're fired!

          MONIX
          Fuck you.

          JACKIE MOON
          Fuck you.

          MONIX
          Get up and run. You're going to
          puke like everybody else.

          JACKIE MOON
          Monix, I need to talk to you.

          MONIX
          We'll. talk after you puke. GO!

          

          

          

          

          71.
          Jackie can't get up, but he crawls, dying...

          JACKIE MOON
          I can't puke Monix!

          MONIX
          Yes you can. Go.
          Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood.

          JACKIE MOON
          Monix! You don't understand. I've
          never thrown up in my life.

          MONIX
          What are you talking about?

          JACKIE MOON
          I've never puked. Ever.

          MONIX
          That makes no sense. Everyone has
          thrown up before.

          JACKIE MOON
          I haven't. I swear to God. I can
          eat anything. I can drink anything.
          I've been sick, but I've never
          puked. I swear to God.

          MONIX
          That's bullshit. Keep moving,
          you're going to puke.

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't puke. I can't do it! It's
          the truth! I swear on my Mother's
          grave.
          At this point, Monix can't help but be intrigued.

          MONIX
          What about when you were a baby?
          Babies throw up all the time.

          JACKIE MOON
          My Mom said I never did. I swear.
          She said I was fascinating.

          MONIX
          No way.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          JACKIE MOON
          You can call my Dad! I've never
          puked.
          When Jackie looks up at Monix, it's clear he is not lying.

          MONIX
          Isn't that kind of dangerous?

          JACKIE MOON
          What do you mean?

          MONIX
          What happens if you swallow poison?

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't know. I ate bad sausage
          before. But nothing happened.

          MONIX
          Stand up.
          Jackie manages to stand up.

          MONIX
          Have you ever been punched in the
          Jejunum?

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't know. What's a Jejunum?

          MONIX
          It's part of your small intestine.

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't know. I doubt--

          BOOM.

          MONIX'S POWERFUL FIST LIFTS JACKIE'S TORSO IN THE AIR.
          ECU: Monix's knowing fist digs deep under Jackie's rib cage.
          It's the hardest punch ever filmed.
          ON JACKIE'S REACTION: He stands, beyond pain, empty of any
          possible air. The blood leaves his face andhis eyesbecome
          confused, watering strangely.
          Part of Jackie's brain wants tospeak,buthe feelsunhuman--
          his lips separate only slightly.
          He wanders out of frame.

          

          

          

          

          73.

          EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLESIUM - LATER - DAY


          A SIDE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. JACKIE STUMBLES OUT INTO DAYLIGHT,

          INTO THE GRASS. HE PAUSES, THEN SUDDENLY STARTS RUNNING, BUT

          STOPS, CONFUSED, LIKE A WOUNDED GAZELLE...

          JACKIE STAGGERS FURTHER, USING A TREE TO KEEP HIS BALANCE AS

          HE STRUGGLES TO STAY CONSCIOUS.

          JACKIE IS ABOUT TO SPEAK, BUT HIS BODY LURCHES. HE HOLDS HIS

          RIB CAGE, SHOCKED. A SUDDEN FEELING OF FEAR SHOOTS THROUGH

          HIS BONES.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to the sky)
          Mom?

          WITH THAT, JACKIE PROJECTILE VOMITS. THE DISCHARGE IS BEYOND

          BELIEF. A LIFETIME'S WORTH OF TOXINS ARE LAUNCHED OVER A

          SHRUB. JACKIE WAILS IN DESPAIR.
          MONIX stands in the doorway, watching this.

          MONIX
          You okay?
          Jackie is about to speak, but then takes stock of his
          feelings. There is now an air of tranquility about him.
          Reborn. He's almost Euphoric...

          JACKIE MOON
          I'm beautiful.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT

          An intense game is underway. The Flint team works hard away
          from the ball. As the Monix voice over continues, we watch
          the team move just like in practice. Monix is playing too.
          Note: The team also looks 'hot.' Clarence plays with an even
          bigger afro. Jackie Moon sports a large perm, striped tube
          socks and the whitest thighs you've ever seen.

          MONIX (V.O.)
          .On offense, we share the ball.
          We look for the easy pass, not the
          spectacular pass...
          Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it. For the first
          time in this sequence, we see the ball. Clarence has a clear
          passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up.

          

          

          

          

          74.

          MONIX (V.O.)
          . If a guy's more open than you
          are, he gets the ball...
          Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. The
          Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play, we
          continue to the voice over from practice...

          MONIX (V.0.)
          .On defense, we're going to learn
          to play together. We're going to
          use team traps to pressure people
          into turnovers.
          On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent.
          Monix slaps the ball free. He flips to Clarence who fakes; the
          fast break dunk and dishes to Scootsie.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Can you believe that? Jumping
          Johnny Johnson actually passed the
          ball.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          It was a great pass, too.
          The other team calls time out.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.O.)
          And Jackie Moon has made several
          great defensive plays down the
          stretch. I tell you, Jackie's not
          afraid to knock people around in
          the lane. He's a monster.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          Like a retard in a China shop.
          A twenty-second time out on the floor, Monix huddles them up.

          MONIX
          (huddling up)
          Listen up. I'll in-bound. Clarence,
          protect the ball and penetrate if
          you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or
          me and everyone crash the boards
          hard. Looking good, we're thirty
          seconds away from taking this one
          home. Let's bring it in.

          JACKIE MOON
          He's right guys. But remember, we
          want to win, but not by too much.

          

          

          

          

          '75 .

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          We don't want to win by too much?

          MONIX
          What the Hell is he talking about?

          CLARENCE
          He's worried about the corn dogs.

          MONIX
          What?

          CLARENCE
          If we score a hundred points,
          everyone gets a free corn dog.
          There are signs everywhere.

          JACKIE MOON
          I'm sorry, Monix, but we don't even
          have corn dogs.

          MONIX
          I don't give a shit. We're taking
          it to them.

          JACKIE MOON
          We're up by seven, Monix. Can't we
          just take it easy? We're talking
          about a lot of corn dogs here.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          There could be a riot.

          MONIX
          I don't give a shit about the corn
          dogs, okay? We play hard every
          second. We're running the offense.
          Everyone got that?
          Everyone nods. WHISTLE!

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
          The Tropics are just one bucket
          away from the magic number. Listen
          to this crowd. They know what's at
          stake: A free corn dog.
          Monix has the ball in his hands. He in bounds to Clarence.
          Clarence penetrates and kicks it to Scootsie.
          Scootsie has an open look. He sizes up a jumper...

          

          

          

          

          76.

          FLYING IN LIKE THE WIND IS JACKIE MOON... JUMPING HIGHER THAN

          HE EVER HAS BEFORE IN HIS LIFE...

          REJECTED. SCOOTSIE'S SHOT IS BLOCKED.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Look at this, Jackie Moon has just
          blocked his own teammate's shot.
          I've never seen this before.

          THE BALL BOUNCES UNDER THE BASKET TO VAKIDIS, WHO SEEMS TO

          HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.

          JACKIE MOON

          VAKIDIS! NO!!!

          VAKIDIS TAKES THE BALL AND GOES FOR A DUNK --

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Vakidis takes it up strong to the
          basket...

          BAM! JACKIE MOON TACKLES VAKIDIS INTO THE STANDS.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Ooh. He gets taken out hard by the
          coach.

           LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          Nice!
           The ball bounces into the air, rolls around the rim... And

          DROPS IN.

           LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
           And the basket is... GOOD!

          BUZZER! FINAL SCORE. TROPICS 100 PRO STARS 91.

          JACKIE MOON
          Shit.

          INT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - LATER

          The daiquiri room is crowded with guys. JACKIE is having a
          team meeting.

          JACKIE MOON
          I asked you up to the Daiquiri
          room, because this is a private
          matter.
          (everyone looks around)
          As you know, I threw up recently.

          

          

          

          

          77.
          It was the first time in my life.
          And, well, it's made me feel... I
          guess you could say I've got a new
          clarity in life.
          (Everyone stares back)
          Since vomiting on Wednesday, I've
          been facing my demons. I'm not
          going to be an imposter any more.

          (BEAT)
           And I want you to know, I just
          mailed out 562 corn dog coupons.

          (BEAT)
          And I'd like to bring somebody
          special in... DUKES!
          Dukes walks in. He is still shirtless. Jackie hands him a
          duffel bag.

          JACKIE MOON
          In this bag, is ten thousand
          dollars.

          DUKES
          No way. Really?

          JACKIE MOON
          Actually, it's twenty three
          hundred. But I'm going to pay you
          the rest. The Tropics will not let
          you down. From now on, I want my
          conscience clear.

          DUKES
          Wow. Thanks Jackie.

          JACKIE MOON
          Can I confess something to
          everyone? It's something I've never
          told anybody.

          CLARENCE
          What is it?

          JACKIE MOON
          You know my song 'Love Me Sexy?'

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Everyone knows that song.

          JACKIE MOON
          I stole it.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          No.

          

          

          

          

          7 8

          JACKIE MOON
          It's true.
          (turns away, dramatic)
          My Mom wrote it. Three weeks before
          she died. And I stole it.
          Even Monix is fascinated by this.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Wait, your Mom wrote that? Was she
          a singer?

          JACKIE MOON
          No, she wrote it on a napkin. I
          duped the whole world. I'm nothing
          but a fraud.

          (BEAT)
          It's true, I'm a famous singer. And
          I've landed the hottest wife in the
          world. But, to be honest, we
          usually only sleep together once a
          year. On VJ day.

          CLARENCE
          Damn. VJ day? That's cold.

          JACKIE MOON
          (ignoring Kong)
          And even on that day, I don't feel
          like it's me who's sleeping with
          her.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          What does that mean?

          JACKIE MOON
          She married me because of my song,
          but I didn't write it. So sometimes
          I feel like it's not even me who's
          with her.
          (more emotional)
          Deep down, I feel like it's really
          my Mom who is making love to her.
          When I hold Lucy's supple breasts
          in my hands, they are my Mom's
          hands. When I eat a pair of edible
          panties off of her, they are my
          Mom's teeth.

          DUKES
          That's pretty weird.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          JACKIE MOON
          I'm living in a prison, Dukes.

          CLARENCE
          Why don't you write a song
          yourself? Then you wouldn't feel
          like a fake any more.

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh please! I could never write
          anything as brilliant as 'Love Me
          Sexy!'
          (standing tall)
          Listen to me, Tropics. Today is a
          new day. I am going to be the
          greatest basketball owner you've

          MONIX
          Rotate further out from the key, so
          when you get the ball you can face
          the basket. You've actually got
          some moves, so you can penetrate...
          FLINT RALLIES AROUND THEIR TEAM: The guys in Hawaiin shirts
          are out flyering.

          ever.
          -MONIX THE PLAYER: Despite his knees and back killing him,
          Monix plays like a champion. He's still got some jump left

          .Jackie Moon with a three. He's

          CLARENCE
          Hold up. Are these girls wearing
          underwear?

          JACKIE MOON
          Which girls?
          (turning around)
          Oh. It doesn't look like it. Wow.
          It's true, the ball girls are flashing the crowd with every
          kick.

          CLARENCE

          (MESMERIZED)
          Nice work, Jackie.

          JACKIE MOON
          I didn't do it. They did.
          Melinda winks at Jackie, as her skirt flips up. The crowd is
          going goes crazy.
          -ATTENDANCE: The clicker raises to 906.
          -MORE PRACTICE: Clarence slams a dunk and does a jig.

          MONIX
          Clarence, do me a favor, if you
          dunk the ball, don't dance
          afterwords. Act like you've been
          there before.

          JACKIE MOON
          Actually, Monix, I need him to
          dance. A lot. The fans need it.

          (BEAT)
          It's either that, or we play with a
          monkey.

          MONIX
          Fine, you can dance a little bit.

          JACKIE MOON
          If you dunk it, go fuckin' ape
          shit.
          -GAME TIME. CLARENCE DUNKS THE BALL: He immediately launches
          into a preposterous celebration: Back flip, 360 spin down to
          the splits, back up, he and Jackie give each other ten and
          then do an extended hand jive routine. Now Jackie blows
          Clarence a kiss, which 'knocks him out flat.' Clarence then
          poses, elbow on the floor, hand under his head, smiling.

          JACKIE'S WIFE: LUCY MOON sleeps with LOU REDWOOD.
          -JACKIE THE PROMOTER: Halftime, at center court, a ramp is
          set up. Behind the ramp, all the ball girls lay head-to-toe.

           BOBBY DEE (V.0.)
           These beautiful girls reach a
           combined total of 47 feet... And
           here he comes...
           Jackie comes ROLLER-SKATING at high speed. He hits the jump --
          It's going to be close --

          BAM! HE LANDS HARD, POUNDING DOWN ON TOP OF THE LAST GIRL.

          SHE IS ABSOLUTELY FLATTENED BY THE IMPACT.

          JACKIE HOLDS HIS LEFT SHOULDER IN PAIN, THEN STANDS AND LIFTS

          HIS OTHER HAND, CLAIMING VICTORY.

          THE GIRL ROLLS OVER TO HER BACK, TRYING TO STAY CONSCIOUS.

          BOBBY DEE (V.0.)
          How about that!

          END OF MONTAGE.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NIGHT

          Jackie is on the bench, mid-game. Bobby Dee is taping his
          shoulder.

          JACKIE MOON

          OW.
          (Bobby Dee stops taping)
          No, keep doing'it.

          BOBBY DEE
          You sure boss?

          JACKIE MOON
          Just keep taping it up. I'm fine.
          Now the COMMISH (the league official) steps over.

          COMMISH
          Hey Jackie.

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh, hey Commish.
          (a little worried)

          

          

          

          

          84.
          I didn't know you were in town this
          weekend.

          COMMISH
          Listen, my office has been getting
          your numbers. You claim you've had
          over two thousand people at every
          home game this month.

          JACKIE MOON
          (dead pan)
          That's correct.
          The commissioner looks around, skeptical. As we scan the
          stands, it's clear the crowd is still not big enough.

          COMMISH
          Well, we've counted only nine
          hundred and eighty three here
          tonight.

          JACKIE MOON
          What, you don't think people go to
          the bathroom?
          (Commish isn't buying it)
          Saturdays can be a little slow. You
          should have been here the other
          night, it was SO PACKED.

          COMMISH
          Don't bullshit me, Jackie.
          The commish waves over a little bald man in a suit. PEEKSKILL
          carries a brief case and never talks.

          COMMISH
          From now on, Peekskill here will be
          attending every Tropics home game.
          You're going to have to get a real
          crowd here if you want to qualify
          for the merger.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Jackie Moon is being interviewed on a local talk show.

          INTERVIEWER
          So, the Tropics will be at a size
          disadvantage against the Americans.
          How do you intend to match up with
          their strong inside game?

          

          

          

          

          85.

          JACKIE MOON
          Tomorrow, at half time, I, Jackie
          Moon, will wrestle a bear.

          INTERVIEWER
          Oh, well there's something. But,
          defensively, as a team, do you

          THINK--

          JACKIE MOON
          --That's tomorrow! One night only!
          See Dewie the wrestling bear attack
          me. He's killed people in public
          before.

          INTERVIEWER
          Okay, well, that's some half time
          show.

          JACKIE MOON

          I'M TELLING YOU, NOBODY CAN MISS

          THIS! IF YOU'RE A CHILD, TAKE MONEY

          OUT OF YOUR MOTHER'S PURSE AND WALK

          COLISEUM! EIGHT O'CLOCK!

          INTERVIEWER
          Well, there you have it. Jackie
          Moon, thanks for stopping by. From
          channel 5, this is Mick Kenterman,
          signing off. Good night.

          JACKIE MOON

          DEWIE IS INSANE. HE COULD RIP MY

          HEAD OFF!

          EXT. LYNN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          LYNN carries the garbage out. As she closes the lid, she
          notices something.
          REVEAL: Monix is standing in the yard.

          LYNN
          Well, if it isn't the toast of
          Flint Michigan. Shouldn't you be
          out signing autographs?
          Monix doesn't speak... He stares into her eyes for a moment.

          MONIX
          Will you marry me?

          

          

          

          

          86.

          LYNN
          What?

          MONIX
          You heard me.

          LYNN
          Technically, we're still married
          right now, Monix.

          MONIX
          You know what I mean.

          LYNN
          Do I?

          MONIX
          Do you love me?

          LYNN
          Probably.

          MONIX
          Then let's do it. For real this
          time. I need you.

          LYNN
          Shit. I know you need me, Monix.
          The question is, do I need you?

          KYLE (O.S.)

          WHAT'S UP MONIX!?
          Kyle pokes his head out of the screen door. He wears a Flint
          Jersey with Monix on the back.

          KYLE

          CHECK OUT THE JERSEY, MAN. I'M YOU.

          HA!

          MONIX

          YEAH. HA!
          (to Lynn)
          And I suppose you need him?

          LYNN
          He's loyal.

          MONIX
          Dogs are loyal.

          

          

          

          

          87.

          LYNN
          He ain't stupid, if that's what
          you're trying to say.

          MONIX

          HEY KYLE!

          KYLE

          YEAH?

          MONIX

          CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR? CAN YOU GO

          PICK ME UP A TUBE OF BEN GAY?

          KYLE

          NO PROBLEM, I'LL LEAVE RIGHT NOW.
          Monix and Lynn meet eyes. Lynn tries not to smile, trying to
          be mad. Kyle pulls on some jeans and gets into his truck.

          LYNN
          Don't fuck with him. It's just
          rude.

          MONIX
          (while looking at Lynn)

          DON'T GO TO THE PHARMACY, KYLE. I

          NEED A BIG TUBE, THE KIND THEY SELL

          OUT AT LUGER'S, ON ROUTE 59.

          KYLE

          I'M ALREADY GONE BRO.

          LYNN
          (eyeing Monix)
          What do you think you're doing?

           SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. LYNN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Monix and Lynn are HAVING SEX.
          Lynn is aggressive.
          Years of pent up emotion are building to a climax...

          INT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Meanwhile, KYLE RE-ENTERS THE HOUSE!

          

          

          

          

          88.

          KYLE
          (to the empty living room)
          What's up. I forgot my stupid walle-
          -Kyle stops in his tracks. He HEARS a sound he's never truly
          heard before, Lynn having an orgasm. He slowly walks toward
          the bedroom.
          KYLE'S POV: Peeking around the corner, we spy Monix and Lynn
          still going at it.
          ON KYLE: His whole body goes numb, his face turns red... We
          hold on his face until:

          KYLE
          Monix?

          (BEAT)
          Yes.
          Still undetected, Kyle settles in to watch the show, still
          wearing his Monix jersey.
          Lynn finally looks over and spots Kyle. We can't be sure, but
          his hand might be in his pants. Lynn can't believe her eyes.

          LYNN
          (having sex, whispering
          off to Kyle)
          Stop that.

          KYLE
          Stop what?

          LYNN
          (in pig Latin)
          Ixne-on-the-erking off-je.
          Monix finally notices his sex partner is having a
          conversation. He turns to see Kyle.

          MONIX
          Woah. What the fuck?

          KYLE
          Monix, you of dog!

          MONIX
          What the Hell are you doing!?

          KYLE
          Hey, I'm the victim here. I'm
          allowed to do as I please. This was
          an honor.

          

          

          

          

          89.

          LYNN
          What?
          Monix stands up, wrapping a sheet around him.

          MONIX
          I'm outta here.

          KYLE
          Oh, c'mon man. Don't be like that.
          It's all cool.

          MONIX
          Believe me, this is not all cool.'
          Monix grabs his shit and walks out of the bedroom.

          MONIX
          I'll call you.

          KYLE
          Okay.

          LYNN
          Not you, asshole. He was talking to
          me.

          EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NEXT NIGHT

          There's a real buzz in the air. People are pouring into the
          stadium tonight. Clarence is right outside the locker room,
          eating a Bit-o-Honey, watching with amazement.

          OFFICER MILLER
          Hey is that Coffee Black? I'm
          officer Miller, State Correctional,
          I'm a big fan, you can call me
          Jimmy.

          CLARENCE
          Nice to meet you.

          OFFICER MILLER
          Jackie Moon ordered up a bus full
          of prisoners. Any idea where we all
          should sit?

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS

          PAN: The PRISONERS are all packed into the stands. Next to
          them is a huge group of ladies from an OLD FOLKS HOME... Next
          to a bus load of SICK KIDS from the hospital.

          

          

          

          

          90.
          ON PEEKSKILL trying to count. There's no use analyzing it,
          the place is sold out and the fans are going nuts.
          CENTER COURT: In a wrestling ring, Jackie is in a wrestling
          singlet, wearing head gear, drinking from a squirt bottle.
          PAN TO DEWIE THE BEAR, ready to go.
          CLARENCE, DRESSED AS A REF, is standing in front of JACKIE,
          messaging his shoulders.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          We sold out, man. You did good.

          JACKIE MOON
          I'm scared of bears, Clarence.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          What?

          JACKIE MOON
          I hate these things. I'm freaking
          out right now.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          If you're scared of bears, why the
          Hell are you wrestling one then?

          JACKIE MOON
          Look at this place. We're packed.
          It was a good idea.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          Well, don't worry, you'll pin him
          easy. It'll be fine.

          JACKIE MOON
          You don't understand. I don't like
          bears. I'm feeling dizzy.
          Jackie is seriously petrified. Clarence adjusts the collar of
          his ref jersey and looks around, worried about his friend.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          Maybe we should call it off.

          JACKIE MOON
          NO. Look into my eyes.
          (Clarence does)
          You're the ref tonight. No matter
          what happens in there, do not stop
          the fight, okay?

          

          

          

          

          91
          These people came to see a show.
          I've got to make it through at
          least one round.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          Okay, until you finish the first
          round, I won't call it. Hey, how
          bad can three minutes be, right?

          BEAR HANDLER (O.S.)
          Are you guys ready?
          The bear handler is a large frizzy haired woman.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          I don't know, are we ready?

          JACKIE MOON
          Yeah, let's do it.

          BEAR HANDLER
          You guys want to give me a safe
          word?

          CLARENCE THE REF
          What's a safe word?

          BEAR HANDLER
          It's a word for you to yell to the
          Ref, so he can stop the match.

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't need a safe word.

          BEAR HANDLER
          Tell you what, if you get injured
          or you really feel like you're in
          danger, yell, um, I don't know...
          Spumoni. Once I get a signal from
          the ref, I'll come in.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          What's Spumoni?

          JACKIE MOON
          It's an Italian Gelato, sort of
          like Almond flavored ice cream.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          Is it good?

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't know, I've never had it.

          

          

          

          

          92.

          BEAR HANDLER
          It's really good.
          (Jackie and Clarence nod)
          Okay, so Spumoni is the safe word
          then?

          JACKIE MOON
          No, I don't need a safe word, okay?
          Let's just do this. One round.
          (nodding to the bell man)
          DING DING DING! The bell has rung. The crowd goes crazy.
          Clarence assumes his position as ref.
          Jackie walks slowly toward the bear, frightened.
          They bear scratches his belly, cute. Jackie immediately
          quits.

          JACKIE MOON
          (re: The scratching)
          Okay, fuck this.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          What? You can't quit already.

          JACKIE MOON
          SPUMONI. I'm out of here.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          You can't SPUMONI, all he did was
          scratch his nuts.

          JACKIE MOON
          Well, too bad, I'm SPUMONI-ING.
          PEOPLE START TO BOO. Jackie looks around at the angry crowd.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          You gotta give 'em a show. C'mon,
          the bear seems pretty tired, look
          at him.
          It's true, the bear is pretty docile. The bear's indifference
          gives Jackie a glimmer of confidence.

          CLARENCE THE REF
          Just test him out a little. Maybe
          it won't be so bad.
          Jackie nods, then hops around with his dukes in the air. Now
          he does a shuffle for the crowd. After dancing a bit, the
          bear is still motionless.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          JACKIE MOON
          (tapping the bear)
          C'mon Dewie...
          (off screen)
          What's going on? Is he going to--

          --THE BEAR MAULS JACKIE. LIKE LIGHTENING, JACKIE HAS ALREADY

          BEEN TACKLED AND STRANGLED AGAINST THE ROPES.

          JACKIE MOON

          AAAHHHHHH!!!!!

          CLARENCE THE REF
          Damn.

          BEAR HANDLER
          Woah-ho. I've never seen that
          before.

          THE CROWD IS GOING BALLISTIC. NOW THE BEAR THROWS JACKIE

          ACROSS THE RING LIKE A LIMP RAG DOLL.

          JACKIE MOON

          AAAHHH!!! SPUMONI!!!

          CLARENCE THE REF

          NO SPUMONI.

          JACKIE MOON

          FUCK YOU CLARENCE! SPUMONI!

          THE BEAR IS GOING BALISTIC. JACKIE TRIES TO CRAWL AWAY, BUT

          DEWIE JUMPS ON HIM, GRABS HIS HEAD AND TRIES TO RIP IT OFF OF

          HIS SHOULDERS. THIS BEAR HAS LOST HIS MIND.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to the handler)

          SPUMONI!

          ANIMAL HANDLER
          (to Clarence)

          I THINK MY BEAR'S SPOOKED, REF. I

          THINK YOU NEED TO CALL IT.

          CLARENCE THE REF

          NO. ONE ROUND. THIS IS WHAT HE

          WANTS, TRUST ME.

          GASPING FOR BREATH, JACKIE IS BEING SUFFOCATED BY A POWERFUL

          BEAR HUG.

          

          

          

          

          94.

          JACKIE MOON

          PLEASE GOD, SOMEONE SPUMONI! I'M

          BEGGING YOU, CLARENCE.

          CLARENCE THE REF

          LOOKING GOOD, BOSS.

          JACKIE IS HANGING HALF WAY OUT OF THE RING. HE'S NOSE TO NOSE.:

          WITH THE BEAR HANDLER.

          JACKIE MOON
          (screaming at the bear

          HANDLER)

          GELATO! ALMOND ICE CREAM!
          (in Italian)
          Asta zittu'sto parcnuso spumoni!

          BEAR HANDLER
          (to Clarence)

          WE HAVE TO STOP IT!

          CLARENCE THE REF

          NO WAY! I'M THE REF!

          BEAR HANDLER
          (climbing in)
          Screw this, I'm stopping it.
          The bear handler tries to get into the ring with a stick and
          loop. But CLARENCE TRIES TO PUSH THE BEAR HANDLER back out of
          the ring.

          DEWIE TURNS TO FIND HIS HANDLER IN DANGER.

          LIKE LIGHTENING, THE BEAR MAULS CLARENCE.

          CLARENCE THE REF

          AAAHHHHH!!! I'M THE REF!!!

          SPUMONI!!!
          DING! The first round is over, but the bear does not return
          to his corner.

          CLARENCE THE REF

          THE BELL RANG! SPUMONI!!!

          And, believe it or not, the Flint
          Tropics are in perfect position to
          qualify for the NBA merger. If they
          win their final game, they'll
          clinch fourth place. But nothing is
          ever easy against the first place
          San Antonio Spurs.
          As Jackie does a victory dance, the commissioner approaches.

          COMMISH
          Jackie.

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And
          a packed house too.

          COMMISH
          I need to talk to you... And the
          rest of your team. Alone.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          The whole team stands solemnly.

          

          

          

          

          96.

          COMMISH
          I'm sorry, but even if you beat the
          Spurs on Friday, we just can't have
          an NBA franchise in Flint.

          MONIX
          What are you saying?

          COMMISH
          It's just not good business. Flint
          isn't a big enough media market,
          okay? This stadium is small and,
          frankly, it needs to be torn down
          before someone gets hurt. I'm sorry
          but nobody ever thought you guys
          could ever get this far.

          CLARENCE
          Well tough shit. This team did make
          it this far. Rules are rules.

          COMMISH
          Rules are rules... Until the
          expansion committee makes new
          rules. Then those rules are the
          rules.
          Everyone looks at each other. Jackie's brain has slipped into
          a deep trance. He is no longer inside his body.

          COMMISH
          Don't take this personally, Jackie.
          These other teams have strong
          markets, new stadiums. It's just
          not going to happen for you Flint
          boys. I'm sorry.
          The devastation of what is happening is palpable. Nothing has
          ever hurt this bad before.

          COMMISH
          I know you're going to punch me,
          Jackie. So let's just get it over
          with.
          The commissioner stands brave, eyes closed, chin out.
          Jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything. He
          stumbles out of the room like a zombie. The team follows.
          The commissioner opens his eyes. A long silent beat...

          

          

          

          

          97.

          COMMISH
          (to himself)
          How did I get out of that one?
          Suddenly KONG darts in and squeezes the commissioner's balls
          with a kung fu grip.

          COMMISH
          Ah!

          EXT. FLINT TROPICS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          The team files out into the parking lot, totally devastated.

          We can get a lawyer, dude. We can
          fight this!... Can't we?... Monix?
          Monix just looks to the ground, as in 'it's over.'

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Jackie... Please... Say something.
          Jackie opens his mouth... He tries to speak, but he can't.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Are you crying?

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't know.
          (contorting his face)
          I'm trying to.
          (looking to the sky)
          I wish I could just puke this away.
          (to Monix)
          Do it to my Jejunum, Monix. Help
          me.
          But Monix is leaving. He turns and walks off, alone down the
          dark street... The others walk away too...

          JACKIE MOON
          Wait! Monix! Where is everyone
          going?...

          CLARENCE
          Thought I might find you here.
          (long beat)
          I got traded.

          MONIX
          Yeah, I heard.

          CLARENCE
          I guess the San Antonio Spurs are
          picking up the players they want,
          before we're eligible for the
          expansion draft.

          MONIX
          Coffee Black, going to the NBA...

          CLARENCE
          They won't let me finish out with
          the Tropics. So, we'll be playing
          against each other in the last
          game. That's pretty weird.

          MONIX
          It won't be weird. The game doesn't
          count.

          CLARENCE
          Listen I'm sorry about--

          MONIX
          Don't be sorry.

          CLARENCE
          I mean, I just want to say that,
          this year, you really--

          MONIX
          --DON'T. Alright? Just don't.
          Clarence stares at him. Then eventually stands up to leave.
          There are a million things he wants to say, but he says this:

          CLARENCE
          We worked so hard.

          MONIX
          Well, it was all for nothing.

          CLARENCE
          So, that's just it then?

          

          

          

          

          100.

          MONIX
          That's just it.
          Clarence shakes his head and walks out.

          EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - MORNING

          The morning sun shines down on the sad town of Flint.
          Monix walks home in the street. He stops and TAKES A LEAK
          right in the middle of the road. A car honks at him to get
          out of the way, then skids to a stop.
          Lynn pokes her head out of the car.

          LYNN
          What the fuck are you doing?

          MONIX
          Oh. Hey Lynn.

          INT. LYNN'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

          Monix is on the couch, drunk. He gazes at the TV and swigs
          his beer.
          Now LYNN walks in.

          LYNN
          I thought the deal was, you were
          going to sleep.

          MONIX
          Pshh. Relax.

          LYNN
          So, you're just going to sit here
          in my house and drink for the
          entire day?

          MONIX
          You got a problem with that?

          LYNN
          Yeah, I do. Maybe you could put
          some pants on and go piss off
          somebody else.

          MONIX
          Fine, maybe I will!

          (STANDING)
          Where are my pants?

          

          

          

          

          101.

          LYNN
          Tell me something, Monix-

          MONIX
          No.

          LYNN
          Whatwereyou trying to accomplish
          thisyear?You never really gave a
          shitaboutthat NBA merger, did
          you?
          Monix doesn't say anything.

          LYNN
          The merger, Monix, did you ever
          care about it?
          Monix still stays quiet.

          LYNN
          Tell me, if you didn't care about
          the merger, what the Hell were you
          playing for!?

          MONIX
          I wanted fourth place! Okay? That
          was the whole fucking thing!

          LYNN
          Well, guess what! Fourth place is
          still sitting there, waiting for
          you to win it!
          Monix doesn't look at her.

          LYNN
          Think about it.

          EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - DAY

          A wide shot of an alley. We hear a familiar voice off screen.

          JACKIE MOON (O.S.)
          (singing bizarre)
          Baby, who wants to- love me sexy!
          baby, Ugh, are you ready to; lick
          me sexy!!!? Yeah yeah!! HA!
          INSIDE A DUMPSTER, REVEAL: Jackie lays in garbage and sings
          up to the sky. It's official, he has lost his mind.

          

          

          

          

          102.

          JACKIE MOON
          (tweaking the lyrics)
          I'm a big faker and I stole this;
          Song-ly sexy. I'm the biggest
          failure in the; world-ly sexy. I'm
          going to kill my; self-y sexy.

          BEE BEE ELLIS (O.S.)
          Jackie?
          Bee Bee Ellis hears Jackie voice and discovers him in laying
          the garbage. Jackie ignores his teammate.

          JACKIE MOON
          I'm going to hang myself with an
          extension; cord-y sexy.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Jackie! What the Hell are you doing
          in a dumpster?

          JACKIE MOON
          (ignoring Bee Bee)
          I am urinating in my pants right
          now.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          You gotta get it together, man.
          Monix called a team meeting.

          INT. THE KREMLIN - LATER DAY

          The entire team has gathered. Monix addresses them.

          MONIX
          Listen up. We all know that
          Clarence has been traded. And we
          all know that this game doesn't
          matter anymore, right?

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Right.

          MONIX
          Well I've got news for you. This
          game does matter. It matters
          because this is the last real
          basketball game any of us is ever
          going to play. Ever.
          The guys nod, solemn.

          

          

          

          

          103.

          MONIX
          Tomorrow night, I say we leave it
          all out there on the floor. Because
          there's nothing else for us to save
          it for. Clarence or no Clarence.
          NBA or no NBA. Merger or no merger.
          We decided we are going to win
          fourth place. And that's what we're
          going to do.
          Jackie is moved. The guys look at each other and nod.

          MONIX
          Over the past five weeks, we've
          become a team. And that is no small
          thing. Jackie, have you ever been
          on a real team before?

          JACKIE MOON
          No sir.

          MONIX
          How does it feel?

          JACKIE MOON
          It feels pretty good.

          MONIX
          All your lives, you've dreamed of
          playing in the NBA. Well, guess
          what? Tomorrow night, you are.
          You're playing an NBA team. And for
          one night, the world is going to
          know that you belong.

          (BEAT)
          Look, I tried to pretend like it
          didn't matter to me if we made it
          to fourth or not.
          Monix turns inward, speaking with an emotion that is pure.

          MONIX
          But the truth is, I want this more
          than anything I've ever wanted in
          my whole fucked-up life.

          (BEAT)
          And I think you do too. I think you
          can taste it. Because we earned
          this. We made this happen. And
          we're four quarters away from
          making our dreams come true.

          

          

          

          

          104.

          JACKIE MOON

          LET'S DO THIS!

          BEE BEE ELLIS

          YEAH! LET'S GO!

          MONIX

          JACKIE, YOU'VE GOT ONE MORE GAME TO

          PROMOTE!
          (to the team)

          LET ME HEAR IT! FOURTH PLACE!

          EVERYONE

          FOURTH PLACE!
          Pumped, they jump around, ready to make their own history.

          MONIX

          FOURTH PLACE!

          EVERYONE

          FOURTH PLACE!

          INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

          A sports show host is interviewing Jackie.

          JACKIE MOON
          The Spurs may be the #1 team in the
          league, but they're going to have
          to prove it on Friday night.

          TV ANNOUNCER
          Since this game doesn't count,
          Jackie. What exactly is your
          motivation?

          JACKIE MOON
          (with a gleam in his eye)
          We.'re going to win this game,
          because we want it. It's as simple
          as that. That alone should make
          people want to show up and root for
          us.
          Jackie and the announcer look at each other for a long moment
          of silence...

          JACKIE MOON
          Plus, this is the FLINT MICHIGAN

          MEGA-BOWL!

          

          

          

          

          105.

          TV ANNOUNCER
          What?

          JACKIE MOON
          Save your ticket stubs, the mega-
          bowl is an historic event.

          TV ANNOUNCER
          I'm not sure I understand.

          JACKIE MOON
          It's a Mega-Bowl. What's not to
          understand?

          TV ANNOUNCER
          This game has no effect on--

          JACKIE MOON
          --The Mega Bowl trophy is twelve
          feet high. AND IT IS GLORIOUS.

          TV ANNOUNCER
          I'm sorry, but this sounds like
          something you just made up.

          JACKIE MOON
          Well, I didn't.

          TV ANNOUNCER
          Well, it doesn't make any sense.
          They're just words.

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh please. You're just words.
          (directly at camera)

          COME SEE THE FLINT TROPICS RAISE

          THE MEGA BOWL TROPHY HIGH ABOVE OUR

          HEADS. WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO

          FINISH IN FOURTH, WE'RE GOING TO

          TAKE HOME THE MEGA BOWL TROPHY.

          TOMORROW NIGHT AT 8 O'CLOCK!

          EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN - MORNING

          The sun rises above the city. In the morning light, Flint
          looks almost electric.

          EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - FRIDAY NIGHT

          The parking lot is rocking. The whole town is jazzed for the
          big event.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          if the commissioner is listening, I
          recommend he stay out of the city
          of Flint tonight. He's not too
          popular in this town.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.O.)
          i will stab him in the stomach with
          an eight inch hunting knife.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          There were many wild protests in
          Flint this week. But it seems like
          the whole city is now focused on
          beating the San Antonio Spurs. This
          team seems to have captured every
          heart in this town of underdogs.
          People have poured in from around
          the state to support this drive
          toward their first mega-bowl
          championship.

          INT. SPURS LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

          Clarence is getting dressed in the visitor's locker room. He
          holds up a Spurs Jersey and now pulls the strange colors over
          his head.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.O.)
          The Flint Tropics will be playing
          without their number one scorer,
          Coffee Black tonight. The Spurs
          have signed several new players
          from around the ABA, locking them
          in before they hit the free market
          in next year's expansion draft. The
          .big man, Pete Petrelli has been
          sent over from the dismantled
          Anaheim Amigos.
          Now Petrelli enters frame. The guy we hate has been traded to
          the Spurs too.

          PETRELLI
          We may be teammates, but I still
          think you're a dick.

          CLARENCE
          Thanks Petrelli.

          

          

          

          

          107.

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS

          WHEELCHAIR DARREN and JODY take their positions next to the
          court. DUKES sits in the stands. QUINCY wears a new fur coat,
          sitting center court. The TROPICAL AISLE cheers, rowdy. The
          BALL GIRLS look almost nervous. You can feel the excitement.
          And now entering, by herself, standing in the back, is LYNN.
          She takes a deep breath.

          INT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Monix addresses the team.

          MONIX
          You want to know what I love? This.
          The eleven of us right here, right
          now, waiting for the biggest game
          of our lives to begin.

          (BEAT)
          I want you to remember something. I
          want you to remember what this
          feels like, to be here in this
          locker room together, one last
          time, shoulder to shoulder with
          these men. Because we are not
          ourselves tonight. We are one.
          This is what I love.

          (BEAT)
          Let's play basketball.

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LATER

          The game is well under way. It's full tilt action.
          It's immediately clear that the Tropics are being over
          powered.
          QUICK CUTS: PETRELLI knocks over Monix and scores.
          -The Tropics offense is getting shut down.
          -Jackie gets a rebound, but then dribbles off his ankle.
          -The fans are disappointed. The guys in the Tropical Aisle
          are all bummed out. Wheelchair Jody looks pissed.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Not a good first half for the
          Tropics so far. They're already
          down by ten.
          ON CLARENCE: He sits on the Spurs bench.

          

          

          

          

          108.

          SPURS COACH
          Coffee Black, you're going in.

          CLARENCE
          I can't. I've got back spasms.
          The coach stares him down, then picks another player.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          This is easily the worst half of
          basketball the Tropics have ever
          played. And that's saying
          something.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          Yep. It's a shit fucking sandwich.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Let's watch the F-bomb, Lou. We're
          live.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          Oh, please, this is our last game.
          I can say whatever I want. Watch
          this: I hope Gerald Ford gets ass
          raped.

          LIVE TROPICS RADIO
          Okay then. We've got just fifteen
          seconds left in the first half...
          Here's Monix with a no-look to
          Jackie... He goes up strong--

          SLO MO: PETRELLI FLIES IN AND ELBOWS JACKIE HARD IN THE HEAD.

          SLO MO: JACKIE'S HEAD SNAPS BACK...

          SLO MO: JACKIE FALLS TO THE HARDWOOD, UNCONSCIOUS, HE BOUNCES

          OFF THE FLOOR.

          LYNN
          Oh my God.
          Everyone in the stadium watches as Jackie lays out cold.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          I've never seen anyone take a hit
          quite like that before. This looks
          serious.
          CLARENCE looks worried from the Spurs bench.

          

          

          

          

          109.

          CLARENCE

          JACKIE!

          SPURS COACH
          Do not leave this bench, Coffee.
          BEE BEE leans over Jackie, worried.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Jackie? You awake?

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          Bring in the stretcher!

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          We don't have one.

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          I don't want to speculate, but I'm
          pretty sure he's dead.
          MONIX gets in Petrelli's face.

          MONIX
          What are you trying to prove
          Petrelli? You afraid to play
          basketball?

          PETRELLI
          Hey, check the scoreboard.
          Monix attacks Petrelli.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Now Monix is after Petrelli. This
          is total chaos.

          FATHER PAT THE REF
          (to the clock man)
          Let those fifteen seconds run out!
          (to everyone)
          It's half time! Everyone off the
          court!

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          And at half time. It's the Spurs
          60, the Tropics 29.
          The guys carry Jackie off the court and into the locker room.
          ON CLARENCE: He's had enough. He stands up and begins walking
          across the court, to join the Tropics.

          

          

          

          

          110.

          SPURS COACH
          Where the Hell are you going?

          CLARENCE
          I'm going to my team.

          SPURS COACH
          This is your team. You are not
          leaving this bench.
          From the front row, the COMMISSIONER hears all of this and
          stands up, surrounded by security guards.

          COMMISH
          You sit down! You're not playing
          with those idiots ever again. If
          you walk away from this bench now,
          you're never coming back. I'll see
          to it you never play in the NBA!
          Ever! Do you understand what I'm
          saying to you, Coffee?

          CLARENCE
          My name ain't Coffee. It's
          Clarence.
          With that, Clarence walks across the floor. The crowd erupts.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Look at this. Coffee Black is
          walking over to the Tropics. This
          crowd is going crazy!
          Clarence takes off his Spurs jersey and throws it into the
          crowd.

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - LOCKER ROOM - HALF TIME

          Jackie is laid out on a bench. Scootsie pours a bucket of
          water on him. It doesn't work. Everyone looks worried.
          Clarence enters the locker room.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          Clarence!

          CLARENCE
          Is he okay?

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          I don't know.

          

          

          

          

          MONIX
          What the Hell are you doing here?

          CLARENCE
          I'm with you guys.

          MONIX
          Are you out of your mind? You want
          to lose your NBA contract? Get out
          of here.

          CLARENCE
          No.

          MONIX
          You're going to give up the NBA for
          this?
          (he is)
          Well, you're a fucking asshole.
          (now to Jackie)
          Jackie. Are you okay buddy?
          Monix cracks a smelling salt and waves it over Jackie's face.

          WE PUSH IN ON JACKIE...

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. DREAMLAND - DAY

          We're in Heaven. Jackie floats next to his Mother, who wears
          a white robe and holds a red, white and blue basketball. A
          basketball hoop hovers behind their heads.

          JACKIE'S DREAM MOM
          (in a dream)
          Now, I want you to go forward, and
          tell the others what I have told
          you here today. Do you understand
          me, son?

          JACKIE MOON
          (in a dream)
          Yes Mother. You are so kind.

          (BEAT)
          I'm sorry I stole your song.

          JACKIE'S DREAM MOM
          I forgave you for that a long time
          ago. I'd say it's about time you
          forgave yourself.

          

          

          

          

          112.

          JACKIE MOON
          I don't want to leave this place.
          It's so fluffy. I miss you, Mom.

          JACKIE'S DREAM MOM
          I miss you too, Jackie. Now, you
          gotta wake up. You're missing the
          game.

          JACKIE MOON
          Oh. I am? That's bad isn't it?

          (BEAT)
          Can you make time go backwards?

          JACKIE'S DREAM MOM
          Not really. Now hurry up. And don't
          forget what I said.
          Jackie walks into the clouds, then turns back.

          JACKIE MOON
          Hey Mom, I threw up.

          JACKIE'S DREAM MOM
          I know you did, sweetie.

          INT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Jackie wakes from his dream. Confused.
          JACKIE'S POV: Bee Bee Ellis, Twiggy Munson, Scootsie Double-
          Day and Kong Yi look down at camera.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          He's awake.

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER

          We're back with Live ABA radio.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          This just in. It sounds like Jackie
          Moon is up and around the locker
          room. That's good news for the
          Tropics.

          INT. TROPICS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Monix coaches the team. Jackie rubs his head, not listening.

          

          

          

          

          113.

          MONIX
          And I don't care how quick their
          defense is, we need to move the
          ball and--

          JACKIE MOON
          --Hold on you guys. I have
          something to tell you.

          MONIX
          What is it?
          Jackie seems very serious...

          JACKIE MOON
          I had a dream. I had a dream, I was
          in heaven and my Mother spoke to
          me... She was wearing a flowing
          white gown... And she showed me a
          whole new way to score a basket.
          She spoke to me and said with this
          gift, you will win fourth place.'

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          He's lost his mind.

          TWIGGY MUNSON
          We need to figure out what we're
          going to do in the second half.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Yeah, we don't have time for any
          ghost baskets.

          JACKIE MOON

          YOU WILL NOT SPEAK OF MY MOTHER

          THIS WAY! THIS SHOT IS MAGICAL!

          DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
          Jackie's eyes are intense and he's breathing way too hard.
          This dream was real. Monix tries to pacify him.

          MONIX
          Alright Jackie, relax, okay?

          JACKIE MOON

          I WILL NOT RELAX! WE HAVE TO USE

          THIS! IT'S A GIFT FROM THE

          OTHERWORLD!
          Monix and Clarence shoot each other a look. Clearly, Jackie
          is not going to take no for an answer.

          

          

          

          

          114.

          CLARENCE
          Okay Jackie, so what's the play?

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLLESIUM - NIGHT

          The second half is underway. Clarence and Jackie are both
          playing for the Tropics.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          We're back in action here at the
          Mega Bowl. Coffee Black is playing
          for the Tropics... And Jackie Moon
          makes the start... In fact, it
          looks like he's trying to run the
          offense here...
          Jackie dribbles at the top of the key, doing a lot of
          pointing along with multiple hand signals.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          This is a new offense for the
          Tropics. Jackie dribbles to the top
          of the key... And...
          Jackie makes eye contact with Clarence.
          Clarence cuts to the basket and Jackie throws him a lob.
          SLO MO: As Clarence leaps, we hear Jackie's voice over from
          the locker room...

          JACKIE (V.0.)
          I had a dream. And in my dream, my
          mother jumped... Her gown flowing
          in the wind... And she caught a
          pass in the air and dunked it,
          without ever touching the ground...
          SLO MO: Clarence catches it and slams it hard.

          JACKIE MOON (V.0.)
          .She lifted her veil and said 'I
          call this the Alley Oop.'
          Everyone stands there, astonished. The other team is frozen.
          The fans are confused. The ref has no idea what to do.

          JACKIE MOON (V.0.)
          .And she said it would change the
          game forever...
          The other players are starting to appreciate what they've
          just seen.

          

          

          

          

          115.

          SPUR #1
          Damn, bro.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Woah. I'm sorry, I don't know what
          just happened.

          SPUR #2
          Doesn't he have to dribble first?

          LOU REDWOOD (V.0.)
          What the Hell is going on?

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          Hey Jackie, isn't that against the
          rules?

          JACKIE MOON
          No. My Mom said it was fine.
          The whole arena is waiting for Father Pat the Ref to process
          this information.

          SPURS COACH

          C'MON FATHER PAT! HE CAN'T DO THAT!

          IT'S TRAVELING!
          WHISTLE! Father Pat The ref waves his hands.

          FATHER PAT THE REF

          HOLD ON. STOP THE GAME.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          The ref has stopped the Mega Bowl.

          FATHER PAT THE REF

          FOUL ON NUMBER TWENTY FIVE.

          JACKIE MOON

          FOUL? I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYBODY!

          FATHER PAT THE REF

          WELL, PEOPLE CAN'T JUST FLY IN THE

          AIR LIKE THAT!

          THIS CAUSES JACKIE TO LOSE HIS MIND.

          JACKIE MOON

          OH, PLEASE! DO YOU THINK MY MOM

          WOULD CHEAT IN MY DREAMS?

          FATHER PAT THE REF

          WHAT?

          

          

          

          

          116.

          JACKIE MOON

          SHE'S AN ANGEL! HEAVEN WANTS US TO

          WIN! I WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!
          The other players stop Jackie's attack. Monix steps over and
          calmly states the facts.

          MONIX
          It's not a foul unless you touch
          another player. And it can't be
          traveling without first
          establishing a pivot foot. It's two
          points, Father Pat, two points.
          Father Pat the Ref thinks about this...

          FATHER PAT THE REF

          I'M GOING TO ALLOW IT. TWO POINTS

          FOR FLINT!
          The crowd goes nuts. The other team protests. Jackie points
          to the sky, right through the hole in the roof.

          MUSIC CUE: THE JACKSON FIVE 'DANCING MACHINE'

          QUICK CUTS: THE TROPICS ALLEY OOP THEIR WAY TO FOURTH PLACE.
          -Clarence slams down another alley-oop. Wheelchair Darren and
          Wheelchair Jody go crazy.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          There it is again, Clarence
          leaping, and forcing the ball in a
          downward direction through the goal
          net off of a high arching pass --
          Hold on, I'm being told this is
          called an Alley Oop. Yes, That's
          easier to say.
          -Another Alley Oop! Dukes, shirtless, pumps his fist.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Jackie lobs to Clarence again. YES!
          Another Alley Oop! The Spurs don't
          know what's hit them.
          -Monix double teams and forces a turn over. In the back of
          the stadium, LYNN can't help but scream.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Monix with a steal-- A long bounce
          pass to Scootsie Double-Day for a
          lay-up.

          

          

          

          

          117.
          I'll tell you, Monix is playing on
          one leg here in the second half.
          -Monix cuts off a Bee Bee Ellis pick toward the basket..

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0. )
          Monix penetrates-- and-- Wow! He
          flipped it up behind his back and
          Clarence slammed it home with one
          hand!
          SCOREBOARD: SPURS 100, TROPICS 99 -- : 15 left.

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - FIFTEEN SECONDS LEFT

          Monix's team breaks the huddle and takes the floor.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          In all my years of radio, I've
          never seen anything like this. The
          Tropics have fought their way back
          from a twenty nine point deficit.
          With twelve seconds left to play,
          they're down by one point. A basket
          here could win it.
          IT'S THE FINAL PLAY: The fans pray. Monix takes a deep
          breath, then in bounds the ball--
          SLO MO: Jackie dribbles, looks up and lofts a perfect pass to
          Clarence...
          SLO MO: Clarence flies up for the alley oop slam dunk...
          SLO MO: At the last second, Petrelli flies into frame and
          swats it away!

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Petrelli with the rejection! It's
          out of bounds -- The Tropics keep
          the ball, with seven seconds on the
          clock. I'll tell you Lou, the Spurs
          were looking for that one.
          IN THE HUDDLE: Monix is yelling above the noise.

          MONIX
          (in the huddle)
          Okay, listen up: They've made
          adjustments out there. We can't
          just keep running the Alley Oop,
          okay? They're keying on Clarence.
          Everyone looks at each other, worried.

          

          

          

          

          118.

          SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY
          We're not going to run the alley
          oop?

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          What are we going to run?

          MONIX
          We're going to run The Puke.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          The Puke?

          MONIX
          Don't tell me you've forgotten it.
          Everyone smiles at each other. They haven't.

          MONIX
          We're going to pick away from the
          ball. We're going to move to the
          open space. I won't in bound the
          ball until someone has a good look.
          (beat).
          The Puke.

          CLARENCE
          Amen.

          JACKIE MOON
          Bring it in! One two three--

          EVERYONE

          LET'S GET TROPICAL!
          THE TROPICS RUN THE PUKE: A flash to the high side post with
          an outside screen and a back door cut.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Monix, looking to inbound...
          SLO MO: Clarence sets a pick for Scootsie- Everyone rotates.
          Jackie picks and rolls to the basket, open...
          Monix zips Jackie a no-look pass...

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Jackie goes up strong...

          BUT PETRELLI ELBOWS HIM IN THE HEAD AGAIN! WHISTLE!

          

          

          

          

          119.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          No Good! But Petrelli fouls him!

          JACKIE IS ABLE TO SHAKE OFF THE HEAD INJURY.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          Jackie Moon will shoot two free
          throws here, his team down by one,
          with two seconds on the clock. One
          will tie it. He needs both to win
          it.
          The ref hands Jackie the ball. The players take their places
          along the lane. Jackie steps to the line. The whole arena is
          on pins and needles.

          JACKIE MOON
          (to his team)
          Don't worry you guys, I got this...
          (to the ball girls)
          I am awesome at free throws.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          I'll tell you, I don't remember the
          last time I've ever seen Jackie
          attempt a free throw...

          JACKIE MOON
          (Louder now, to the fans)

          IT'S OKAY EVERYBODY. SERIOUSLY.

          FREE THROWS ARE, LIKE, MY BEST

          THING.
          Now Jackie sets up for the shot...

          BUT, AS JACKIE PREPARES, HE SETS UP TO SHOOT GRANNY STYLE,

          TOSSING UNDERHANDED FROM BETWEEN HIS KNEES.

          MONIX
          What the Hell are you doing?

          JACKIE MOON
          What, you've never seen me shoot
          free throws before?

          CLARENCE
          He shoots them Granny style.

          BEE BEE ELLIS
          Always has.

          

          

          

          

          120.

          MONIX
          (to himself)
          Shit.
          Jackie's ritual is insane. He breathes, spins the ball, turns
          around 360, deep knee bends, touches his left shoulder four
          times, then SUDDENLY WINGS THE BALL HIGH IN THE AIR.

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          The first attempt is... GOOD!

          IT SWISHES. THE CROWD GOES NUTS...

          LIVE ABA RADIO (V.0.)
          The game is tied. One more and the
          Tropics win.
          Jackie does the same ritual. But this time a bead of sweat
          rolls over his forehead. He is nervous. But he tosses
          anyway...
          SLO MO: The Ball floats toward the basket. Flash bulbs pop.
          SLO MO: The ball bounces off the rim, away from the basket.
          SLO MO: Monix elbows his way into position for a rebound.

          WINS THE MEGA BOWL! FLINT WINS THE

          MEGA BOWL!
          Victory. All the Tropics go crazy, screaming, they pile on
          top of each other at center court.
          The crowd is going nuts. Wheelchair Darren and Jody roll out
          onto the court. Dukes jumps into the pile of players. Lynn
          has tears in her eyes.
          In the madness. LUCY MOON finds her husband, Jackie.

          LUCY MOON
          Jackie!

          Lucy?

          LUCY MOON
          Kiss me, you hero.

          JACKIE MOON
          My Mom says you're a bad lady. She
          says your vagina is for sad people.

          EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS

          Tropics fans pour out onto the streets from the sports bars
          and immediately start smashing shit. It's a total riot.
          A group of Flint COPS see the riot, then FLIP THEIR OWN COP

          CAR OVER.

          INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS

          The team is still celebrating, going crazy at center court.

          THE CHAOS.

          JACKIE LIFTS A GIANT TWELVE FOOT GOLDEN TROPHY IN THE AIR.

          CLARENCE
          Wait, there really is a trophy?

          JACKIE MOON
          Hey, it's the Mega Bowl.

          VICTORY. IN THIS MOMENT, ALL THREE OF THEM SEE THE BEAUTY IN

          WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

          As Credits roll, we hear a voice...

          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          With their first pick in the 1977
          NBA draft, the New Jersey Nets
          select...

          

          

          

          

          122.

          INT. NBA DRAFT - SIX MONTHS LATER

          The NBA draft is crowded with businessmen and fans.

          DRAFT ANNOUNCER
          .Shit, bitch, you be fine...
          Clarence stands up, happy, and walks on stage.
          He holds up a uniform with words: SHITBITCH U.B. PHYNE on it.
          REVEAL: In the crowd, Monix claps, cheering Clarence on... He
          is with wife, LYNN.
          But now Monix stands up and walks on stage too. He puts a NEW
          YORK NETS hat on.

          DRAFT ANNOUNCER
          Here to welcome him is rookie Nets
          coach, Ed Monix.
          Monix and Clarence shake hands for the cameras.

          CLARENCE
          Thanks for bringing me on board,
          coach.

          MONIX
          All the good players were gone.

          CLARENCE
          Do we really have to live in New
          Jersey?

          MONIX
          Just smile for the cameras,
          Shitbitch.

          INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

          Jackie is in a recording studio, playing the synthesizer.
          plays some beats, then hits the keyboards.

          TITLE: JACKIE MOON WENT ON TO WRITE AND RECORD HIS OWN

          ORIGINAL SONG.
          We recognize Jackie's song as the most familiar song in the
          world. It's Gary Glitter's 'Rock N' Roll Part II' the most
          famous sports-stadium standard in history.

          JACKIE MOON
          (singing Gary Glitter)

          HEY!

          

          

          

          

          123.
          (waiting for the beats)

          HEY!
          (waiting for the beats)

          HEY!

          TITLE: HIS SONG WOULD LATER BE STOLEN BY GARY GLITTER AND

          PLAYED IN STADIUMS ACROSS THE GLOBE.

          JACKIE MOON
          (singing Gary Glitter)

          HEY!
          (waiting for the beats)

          HEY!
          (waiting for the beats)

          HEY!
          The song ends. The recording engineer pipes in.

          RECORDING ENGINEER
          Sounded pretty nice.

          JACKIE MOON
          Yeah, that was a great take. Play
          that back for me, would you?

          RECORDING ENGINEER
          Listen, can you take that ring off
          for a little while? I'm getting
          some feedback from your microphone.

          ECU: JACKIE WEARS A HUMONGOUS FLINT MICHIGAN TROPICS FOURTH

          PLACE DIAMOND RING.
          Jackie studies his ring with a smile.

          JACKIE MOON
          Sorry Robert, the ring stays on.
