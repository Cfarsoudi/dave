SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE 


                     by Marc Norman & Tom Stoppard



       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

       SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears. 
       Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre 
       two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and 
       audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, 
       home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. 
       Across the river was the competition, built by Philip 
       Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...

       ...The Rose...

       Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-
       tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, 
       roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It 
       says:

       SEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON

       MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE 
       THEATRE, BANKSIDE

       THE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D

       OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams 
       are coming from the curtained stage.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
                 You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it 
                 is I who am bitten?

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       The theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man 
       screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned 
       in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of 
       a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that 
       position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN, 
       who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is 
       FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper.

                           FENNYMAN
                 What am I, Mr. Lambert?

                           LAMBERT
                 Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

                           FENNYMAN
                 How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

                           FREES
                 Twelve pounds, one shilling and four 
                 pence, Mr. Fennyman, including 
                 interest.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Aaagh! I can pay you!

                           FENNYMAN
                 When?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! 
                 For pity's sake.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Take his feet out. Where will you get

                           FREES
                     (the mathematical genius with 
                      a notebook)
                 Sixteen pounds, five shillings and 
                 nine pence

                           FENNYMAN
                 including interest in three weeks?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I have a wonderful new play!

                           FENNYMAN
                 Put his feet in.

                           HENSLOWE
                 It's a comedy.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Cut his nose off.

                           HENSLOWE
                 A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!

                           FENNYMAN
                 And his ears.

                           HENSLOWE
                 And a share. We will be partners, Mr. 
                 Fennyman!

                           FENNYMAN
                     (hesitating)
                 Partners!

                           HENSLOWE
                 It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken 
                 identities, a shipwreck, a pirate 
                 king, a bit with a dog, and love 
                 triumphant.

                           LAMBERT
                 I think I've seen it. I didn't like 
                 it.

                           HENSLOWE
                 This time it is by Shakespeare.

                           FENNYMAN
                 What's the title?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Good title.

       FENNYMAN snaps his fingers at FREES and LAMBERT. LAMBERT 
       unties HENSLOWE, FREES starts writing a contract.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 A play takes time. Find actors 
                 rehearsalslet's say open in three 
                 weeks. That's--what--five hundred 
                 groundlings at tuppence each, in 
                 addition four hundred groundlings 
                 tuppence each, in addition four 
                 hundred backsides at three pence--a 
                 penny extra for a cushion, call it two 
                 hundred cushions, say two performance 
                 for safety how much is that Mr. Frees?

                           FREES
                 Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. 
                 Fennyman.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Correct!

                           HENSLOWE
                 But I have to pay the actors and the 
                 authors.

                           FENNYMAN
                 A share of the profits.

                           HENSLOWE
                 There's never any

                           FENNYMAN
                 Of course not!

                           HENSLOWE
                     (impressed)
                 Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit 
                 on something.

       FENNYMAN slaps a contract down on the table next to n ink-
       pot and quill.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Sign here.

       HENSLOWE takes the quill and signs.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's 
                 DaughterAlmost finished?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Without doubt he is completing it at 
                 this very moment.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY

       A small cramped space in the eaves of a building. A 
       cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged 
       between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have 
       time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM 
       STRATFORD-UPON-AVON. 

       At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper 
       are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing 
       them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing 
       studiously with a quill. 

       Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his 
       signature, over and over again. "Will ShagsbeardW 
       ShakspurWilliam Shasper" Each time he is dissatisfied, 
       and each time he crumples, and tosses it away. 

       Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to 
       the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts 
       to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and 
       HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will! Where is my play? Tell me you 
                 have it nearly done! Tell me you have 
                 it started.
                     (desperately)
                 You have begun?

                           WILL
                     (struggling with his boots)
                 Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt 
                 that the sun doth move

                           HENSLOWE
                 No, no, we haven't the time. Talk 
                 prose. Where is my play?

                           WILL
                     (tapping his forehead and 
                      heading out the door)
                 It is all locked safe in here

                           HENSLOWE
                 God be praised!
                     (then doubt)
                 Locked?

                           WILL
                 As soon as I have found my muse

       EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL lives in a crowded area of the city. Hawkers are 
       crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and 
       merchants go about their business. HENSLOWE catches up 
       with WILL as he strides purposefully along.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (catching up)
                 Who is she this time?!

                           WILL
                 She is always Aphrodite.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind 
                 the Dog and Trumpet?

                           WILL
                 Henslowe, you have no soul so how can 
                 you understand the emptiness that 
                 seeks a soulmate?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Well, I am a dead man and buggered to 
                 boot. My theatre is close by the 
                 plague these twelve weeks, my company 
                 is playing the inn-yards
                 of England, while Burbage and the 
                 Chamberlain's Men are invited to court 
                 and receive ten pounds to play your 
                 piece, written for my theatre, by my 
                 writer, at my risk when you were green 
                 and grateful -

                           WILL
                 What piece? Richard Crookback?

                           HENSLOWE
                 No--it's comedy they want, Will! 
                 Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?

                           WILL
                 Who wrote that?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Nobody! You are writing it for me! I 
                 gave you three pounds a month since.

                           WILL
                 Half what you owed me. I am still due 
                 for One Gentleman of Verona.

       EXT. ANOTHER STREET. DAY

       HENSLOWE'S hardly paused in his appeal.

                           HENSLOWE
                 . . . Will! What is money to you and 
                 me? I, your patron, you my wordwright! 
                 When the plague lifts Burbage will 
                 have a new Christopher Marlowe for the 
                 Curtain and I have nothing for the 
                 Rose.

       WILL stops.

                           WILL
                 Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty 
                 pounds?

                           HENSLOWE
                     (staggered)
                 Fifty pounds? What for?

                           WILL
                 Burbage offers me a partnership in the 
                 Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my 
                 hired player days are over.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to 
                 the dogs!

                           WILL
                     (answering for him)
                 No, then.

       WILL turns down a side street.

       EXT. MARKETPLACE. DAY.

       HENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace 
       where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone 
       who will listen.

                           MAKEPEACE
                 and the Lord shall smite them! Yea, 
                 harken to me. The theatres are 
                 handmaidens of the devil! Under the 
                 name of the Curtain, the players
                 breed lewdness in your wives, 
                 rebellion in your servants, idleness 
                 in your apprentices and wickedness in 
                 your children! And the Rose smells 
                 thusly rank by any name! I say a 
                 plague on both their houses!

       As he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note.

       EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a 
       doorway.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Where are you going?

                           WILL
                 To my weekly confession.

       As HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign 
       identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH, 
       apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of 
       dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled.

       INT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY

       A stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills, 
       potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic 
       paraphernalia festoon the place. Testimonials and framed 
       degrees hang on the walls. 

       WILL lying on a couch, on his back. His eyes are closed 

       DR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and 
       occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee. 
       What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of 
       analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass.

                           WILL
                 Words, words, wordsonce, I had the 
                 giftI could make love out of words as 
                 a potter makes cups out of clay love 
                 that overthrows empires, love that 
                 binds two hearts together come 
                 hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a 
                 line, I could cause a riot in a 
                 nunnerybut now

                           DR. MOTH
                 And yet you tell me you lie with 
                 women?

       WILL seems unwiling to respond. DR. MOTH refers to his 
       notes.

                           DR. MOTH (CONT'D)
                 Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, 
                 Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who 
                 does it behind the Dog and

                           WILL
                     (interrupting)
                 Aye, now and again, but what of it? I 
                 have lost my gift.

                           DR. MOTH
                 I am here to help you. Tell me in your 
                 own words.

                           WILL
                 I have lost my gift.
                     (not finding this easy)
                 It's as if my quill is broken. As if 
                 the organ of the imagination has dried 
                 up. As if the proud tower of my genius 
                 has collapsed.

                           DR. MOTH
                 Interesting.

                           WILL
                 Nothing comes.

                           DR. MOTH
                 Most interesting.

                           WILL
                 It is like trying to a pick a lock 
                 with a wet herring.

                           DR. MOTH
                     (shrewdly)
                 Tell me, are you lately humbled in the 
                 act of love?

       WILL turns towards him. How did he know that?

                           DR. MOTH (CONT'D)
                 How long has it been?

                           WILL
                 A goodly length in times past, but 
                 lately

                           DR. MOTH
                 No, no. You have a wife, children

       The sand runs through the hourglass.

                           LATER
                 Not much sand left.

                           WILL
                 I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway 
                 was a woman, half as old again.

                           DR. MOTH
                 A woman of property?

                           WILL
                     (shrugs)
                 She had a cottage. One day, she was 
                 three months gone with child, so

                           DR. MOTH
                 And your relations?

                           WILL
                 On my mother's side the Ardens

                           DR. MOTH
                 No, your marriage bed.

                           WILL
                 Four years and a hundred miles away in 
                 Stratford. 
                 A cold bed too, since the twins were 
                 born. Banishment was a blessing.

                           DR. MOTH
                 So now you are free to love

                           WILL
                 yet cannot love nor write it.

       DR. MOTH reaches for a glass snake bracelet.

                           DR. MOTH
                 Here is a bangle found in Psyche's 
                 temple on Olympus cheap at four pence. 
                 Write your name on a paper and feed it 
                 in the snake.

       WILL looks at the snake bangle in wonder.

                           WILL
                 Will it restore my gift?

                           DR. MOTH
                 The woman who wears the snake will 
                 dream of you, and your gift will 
                 return. Words will flow like a river. 
                 I will see you in a week.

       He holds out his hand. WILL drops a sovereign into it, 
       and takes the bracelet.

       EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL comes out. HENSLOWE is waiting, standing in a horse 
       trough to ease his feet. WILL walks straight past him, 
       and HENSLOWE follows.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Now where? Will?

                           WILL
                 To the Palace at Whitehall.

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       WHITEHALL means nothing yet. We are behind closed 
       curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the 
       imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is 
       not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see. 

       RICHARD BURBAGE is to play "PROTEUS." A BOY PLAYER will 
       play "SILVIA," and last minute improvements to his makeup 
       etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE. 
       "LAUNCE," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL 
       KEMPE. "LAUNCE'S" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is 
       not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard 
       reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS 
       can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other 
       side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE 
       leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of 
       proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his 
       elbow on his knee, he looks at the skullin other words 
       he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of 
       WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage.

                           WILL
                     (approaching)
                 Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You 
                 too, good Crab.

                           KEMPE
                 Crab is nervous. He has never played 
                 the Palace. When will you write me a 
                 tragedy, Will? I could do it.

                           WILL
                 No, they would laugh at Seneca if you 
                 played it.

       WILL'S attention has been caught by ROSALINE, BURBAGE'S 
       mistress. ROSALINE is big breasted, dark-eyed, dark-
       haired, sexual.

                           BURBAGE
                     (to ROSALINE)
                 My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress 
                 Rosaline, where were my seamstress's 
                 eyes?

       BURBAGE kisses her mouth and slaps her behind. He comes 
       over to greet WILL.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                 There is no dog in the first scene, 
                 Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it 
                 Will?

                           WILL
                 I am still owed money for this play, 
                 Burbage.

                           BURBAGE
                 Not from me. I only stole it. When are 
                 you coming over to the Chamberlain's 
                 Men?

                           WILL
                 When I have fifty pounds.

       ROSALINE brings over the last elements of BURBAGE'S 
       costume and helps him into them.

                           BURBAGE
                 Are you writing?

                           WILL
                     (nods somewhat defensively)
                 A comedy. All but done, a pirate 
                 comedy, wonderful.

                           BURBAGE
                 What is the chief part?

                           WILL
                 Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.

                           BURBAGE
                 The title?

                           WILL
                 Romeo

                           BURBAGE
                 I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.

                           WILL
                 It's for Henslowe. He paid me.

                           BURBAGE
                 How much?

                           WILL
                 Ten pounds.

                           BURBAGE
                 You're a liar.

       BURBAGE digs under his costume for his purse, which is on 
       a waistband, over his corset.

                           WILL
                 I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and 
                 the Admiral's Men.

                           BURBAGE
                 Ned is wrong for it.

       WILL turns to see HENSLOWE approaching.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                     (to WILL)
                 Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you 
                 two more when you show me the pages.

                           WILL
                 Done.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (arriving)
                 Burbage, I will see you hanged for a 
                 pickpocket.

                           BURBAGE
                 The Queen has commanded, she loves a 
                 comedy and the Master of the Revels 
                 favours us.

                           HENSLOWE
                 And what favour does Mr. Tilney 
                 receive from you?

                           BURBAGE
                 Ask him.

       The Master of the Revels (TILNEY) comes through the 
       curtain officiously.

                           TILNEY
                 She comes!

       He disappears back through the curtains. The hubbub falls 
       silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS 
       know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and 
       find places to peep through.

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF 
       HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.

       THE POV OF THE PLAYERS.

       The arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to 
       take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill 
       is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her 
       seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the 
       QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience 
       an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound. 

       Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing "W. 
       Shakespeare." WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips 
       it into the mouth of the snake bangle. 

       The curtain draws back and CONDELL as "VALENTINE" and 
       BURBAGE as "PROTEUS" begin the play.

                           CONDELL AS VALENTINE
                 "Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus; 
                 Home-keeping youth have ever homely 
                 wits"

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. THE 
       WINGS/BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       With BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE 
       curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily. 
       After a moment, WILL pulls back.

                           ROSALINE
                 When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

                           WILL
                 I have lost my gift.

                           ROSALINE
                 You left it in my bed. Come to look 
                 for it again.

                           WILL
                 Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?

                           ROSALINE
                 Burbage has my keeping but you have my 
                 heart.

       WILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm. 
       ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again, 
       but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the 
       auditorium.

                           WILL
                 You see? The consumptives plot against 
                 me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let 
                 us go and cough through it."

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. STAGE. DAY.

       "VALENTINE" is on stage with "PROTEUS."

       CONDELL AS VALENTINE

       "To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy 
       looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth 
       With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights"

       As the scene continues, WILL appears at the back of the 
       hall and finds himself next to HENSLOWE.

                           WILL
                 I feel a scene coming on.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Is it about a pirate's daughter?

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACK OF THE BANQUETING HALL/STAGE. 
       DAY.

       Laughter. It is later, and KEMPE is now on stage with his 
       dog. The audience is roaring.

                           HENSLOWE
                 You see? Comedy.

       QUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the 
       others.

                           QUEEN
                 Well played, Master Crab, I commend 
                 you.

       She throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it 
       down. Everyone applauds.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Love and a bit with a dog, that's what 
                 they like.

       Now we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and 
       beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural 
       enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family 
       group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY 
       MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind 
       as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE. 

       Elsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his 
       forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed 
       VIOLA. The nurse notices him.

       INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF 
       HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.

       LATER. "VALENTINE" is on stage alone. He is speaking the 
       speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear 
       later.

                           CONDELL AS VALENTINE
                 "What light is light if Silvia be not 
                 seen? 
                 What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? 
                 Unless it be to think that she is by 
                 And feed upon the shadow of 
                 perfection"

       Now we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is 
       silently mouthing it with the actor.

                           HENSLOWE
                 There's a lady knows your play by 
                 heart.

       But when he turns to WILL he finds that WILL has gone.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       WILL comes into his room, goes straight to his table in 
       the window, and arranges pen, ink, and paper. Now he has 
       his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his 
       hands together and spits on the floor. Then he sits down, 
       picks up his pen, and stares in front of him. PAUSE. Then 
       he begins to write.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE is undressing her, though VIOLA tries 
       intermittently to push her away. She is still bright with 
       excitement.

                           VIOLA
                 Did you like Proteus or Valentine 
                 best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine 
                 for looks.

                           NURSE
                 I liked the dog, for laughs.

                           VIOLA
                 But Silvia I did not care for much. 
                 His fingers were red from fighting and 
                 he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. 
                 Stage love will never be true love 
                 while the law of the land has our 
                 heroines played by pipsqueak boys in 
                 petticoats! Oh, when can we see 
                 another?

                           NURSE
                 When the Queen commands it.

                           VIOLA
                 But at the playhouse. Nurse?

                           NURSE
                 Be still.

       Now the NURSE is cleaning VIOLA'S ears, one by one, of 
       course. She has an ear-cleaning implement for this. VIOLA 
       submits.

                           NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Playhouses are not for well-born 
                 ladies.

                           VIOLA
                 I am not so well-born.

                           NURSE
                 Well-monied is the same as well-born 
                 and well-married is more so. Lord 
                 Wessex was looking at you tonight.

                           VIOLA
                 All the men at court are without 
                 poetry. If they look at me they see my 
                 father's fortune. I will have poetry 
                 in my life. And adventure. And love. 
                 Love above all.

                           NURSE
                 Like Valentine and Silvia?

                           VIOLA
                 No . . . not the artful postures of 
                 love, but love that over- throws life. 
                 Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot 
                 in the heart, and nothing to be done, 
                 come ruin or rapture. Love like there 
                 has never been in a play.
                     (beat)
                 I will have love or I will end my days 
                 as a . . .

                           NURSE
                 As a nurse.

                           VIOLA
                     (kissing her)
                 But I would be Valentine and Silvia 
                 too. Good Nurse, God save you and good 
                 night. I would stay asleep my whole 
                 life if I could dream myself into a 
                 company of players.

       VIOLA goes over to the window.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE thrusts a twig to her face.

                           NURSE
                 Clean your teeth while you dream, 
                 then.

       Automatically, VIOLA takes the twig and begins brushing 
       her teeth, all the while looking downriver towards the 
       Rose. The NURSE attends her with a beaker of water, and a 
       bowl.

                           NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Now spit

       VIOLA gazes longingly towards the Rose And, there and 
       then, she makes a plan.

       EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

       HENSLOWE is making his way from the theatre to the market 
       place when FENNYMAN and LAMBERT appear at either shoulder 
       and propel him back the way he came. FREES follows 
       behind.

                           FENNYMAN
                 This time we take your boots off!

                           HENSLOWE
                 What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?

                           FENNYMAN
                 The theatres are all closed by the 
                 plague!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Oh, that.

                           FENNYMAN
                 by order of the Master of the Revels!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the 
                 theatre business.
                     (they stop)
                 The natural condition is one of 
                 insurmountable obstacles on the road 
                 to imminent disaster. Believe me, to 
                 be close by the plague is a bagatelle 
                 in the ups and downs of owning a 
                 theatre.

                           FENNYMAN
                 So what do we do?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Nothing. Strangely enough , it all 
                 turns out well.

                           FENNYMAN
                 How?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I don't know. It's a mystery.

                           LAMBERT
                     (dumbly)
                 Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

       At this point din is heard in the background. a 
       messenger, ringing a bell, is running though the street.

                           MESSENGER
                 The theatres are reopened. By order of 
                 the Master of the Revels, the theatres 
                 are reopened

       FENNYMAN is intrigued.

                           FREES
                 Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened 
                 the playhouses.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Yes I heard.

       HENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly, 
       shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (to LAMBERT)
                 If you wouldn't mind

       HENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE, 
       curious.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Where is the play?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Oh, it's coming, it's coming.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       It is. WILL is writing furiously. A burnt-down candle is 
       still alight, although it is day outside the window. He 
       has been writing all night. He has written about ten 
       pages. Pleased with himself and excited, he gathers them 
       up and leaves the room like a man with a mission.

       EXT. WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.

       Leaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down 
       HENSLOWE who has come to see him.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will! The theatres are

       Before he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his 
       hand.

                           WILL
                 Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, 
                 I'm good!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Rosaline? You mean Ethel.

       WILL has gone.

       EXT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

       BURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs 
       through the door without ceremony.

                           WILL
                     (shouting)
                 Richard!

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL enters and calls out.

                           WILL
                 Burbage?

       INT. BURBAGE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

       WILL charges into the bedroom. ROSALINE is in bed. The 
       Master of the Revels is pulling up his breeches. WILL is 
       shattered.

                           WILL
                 Mr. Tilney

       The unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from 
       ROSALINE'S arm.

                           TILNEY
                 Like you, I found him not at home!

                           WILL
                 So this is the favour you find in the 
                 Chamberlain's Men.

                           ROSALINE
                 Will!

                           WILL
                     (to ROSALINE)
                 I would have made you immortal.
                     (turning to go)
                 Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by 
                 Will Shakespeare.

                           TILNEY
                 What does Burbage care of that? He is 
                 readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.

                           WILL
                 You have opened the playhouses?

                           TILNEY
                 I have, Master Shakespeare.

                           WILL
                 But the plague

                           TILNEY
                     (sighs)
                 Yes, I know. But he was always hanging 
                 around the house.

       A bell can be heard ringing outside.

                           ROSALINE
                     (to WILL, leaving)
                 Willyou're the only one, Will!--in my 
                 heart.

       EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands 
       by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He 
       watches for a moment as the pages catch fire.

       INT. TAVERN. DAY.

       WILL walks in to find the place in an uproar of 
       celebration. A handsome young serving man (NOL) is 
       bumping through with a tray of tankards.

                           NOL
                     (excitedly)
                 Mr. Henslowe!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Yes, I heard. The theatres are open. 
                 But where is my playwright?

       HENSLOWE finds a seat, and takes a tankard off NOL'S 
       tray.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Chalk it up, Nol. I'm hungry, too.

                           NOL
                 The special today is a pig's foot 
                 marinated in juniper-berry vinegar, 
                 served with a buckwheat pancake which 
                 has been

       They are interrupted by WILL who joins them. He looks 
       distracted.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will! Have you finished?

                           WILL
                 Yes. Nearly.
                     (he taps his forehead)
                 It's all locked safe in here. We need 
                 Ralph for the Pirate King. Good 
                 morning, Master Nol. You will have a 
                 nice little part.

       NOL shouts for you, takes off his apron and flings it 
       behind the bar. HENSLOWE jumps up and embraces WILL. The 
       entire staff and half the customers are now crowding 
       around, actors the lot of them. HENSLOWE bangs the table 
       to shut them all up.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men are 
                 out on tour. I need actors. Those here 
                 who are unknown will have a chance to 
                 be known.

                           ACTOR
                 What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?

                           HENSLOWE
                 It won't cost you a penny! Auditions 
                 in half-an-hour!

       The din of excited chatter returns. He sweeps grandly to 
       the tavern doorwhere he meets RALPH BASHFORD, a big, 
       burly, middle-aged actor.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                 Ralph Bashford! I'd have a part for 
                 you but, alas, I hear you are a 
                 drunkard's drunkard.

                           RALPH
                 Never when I'm working.

       INT. TAVERN. DAY.

       WILL has remained behind, aghast now at his predicament. 
       He goes to the bar.

                           WILL
                 Give me to drink mandragora.

                           BARMAN
                 Straight up, Will?

                           VOICE
                 Give my friend a beaker of your best 
                 brandy.

       WILL turns towards a figure further down the bar. It's 
       CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.

                           WILL
                 Kit

                           MARLOWE
                 How goes it, Will?

                           WILL
                 Wonderful, wonderful.

                           MARLOWE
                 Burbage says you have a play.

                           WILL
                 I have. And chinks to show for it.

       His drink arrives. WILL places a sovereign on the bar.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. 
                 The BARMAN does the business.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I hear you have a new play for the 
                 Curtain.

                           MARLOWE
                 Not new--my Doctor Faustus.

                           WILL
                 I love your early work. "Was this the 
                 face that launched a thousand ships 
                 and burnt the topless towers of 
                 Ilium?"

                           MARLOWE
                 I have a new one nearly done, and 
                 better. The Massacre at Paris.

                           WILL
                 Good title.

                           MARLOWE
                 And yours?

                           WILL
                 Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
                     (beat, sighs despondently)
                 Yes, I know.

                           MARLOWE
                 What is the story?

                           WILL
                 Well, there's a pirate
                     (confesses)
                 In truth, I have not written a word.

                           MARLOWE
                 Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of 
                 love.

                           WILL
                 Yes, that's good. Until he meets

                           MARLOWE
                 Ethel.

                           WILL
                 Do you think?

                           MARLOWE
                 The daughter of his enemy.

                           WILL
                     (thoughtfully)
                 The daughter of his enemy.

                           MARLOWE
                 His best friend is killed in a duel by 
                 Ethel's brother or something. His name 
                 is Mercutio.

                           WILL
                 Mercutiogood name.

       NOL hurries back to WILL'S side.

                           NOL
                 Will--they're waiting for you!

                           WILL
                 I'm coming.

       He drains his glass.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Good luck with yours, Kit.

                           MARLOWE
                 I thought your play was for Burbage.

                           WILL
                 This is a different one.

                           MARLOWE
                     (trying to work it out)
                 A different one you haven't written?

       WILL makes a helpless gesture and hurries after NOL.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. GALLERY/STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       HENSLOWE and WILL are sitting in the gallery, listening 
       to a YOUNG ACTOR auditioning.

                           YOUNG ACTOR
                 " Was this the face that launched a 
                 thousand ships, And burnt the topless 
                 towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me 
                 immortal with a kiss!"

                           HENSLOWE
                 Thank you.

       HENSLOWE and WILL look a bit deflated. The YOUNG ACTOR 
       leaves and is replaced by a SECOND ACTOR.

                           SECOND ACTOR
                 I would like to give you something 
                 from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

                           HENSLOWE
                 How refreshing.

                           SECOND ACTOR
                 "Was this the face that launched a 
                 thousand ships, And burnt the topless 
                 towers of Ilium?"

       HENSLOWE and WILL let him continue a bit further, but 
       exchange despairing looks. A succession of would-be 
       actors offer their version of Marlowe's lines, each as 
       inappropriate as the other. Among them is a small URCHIN.

                           URCHIN
                 "the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet 
                 Helen, make me immortal with a--?"

                           HENSLOWE
                     (bellows)
                 Thank you!

       The URCHIN leaves, glowering furiously, and is replaced 
       by a beanpole of a man (WASBASH). WABASH has a bad 
       stutter.

                           WABASH
                 "W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f-
                 f-face"

                           HENSLOWE
                     (unexpectedly)
                 Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. 
                 Report to the property master.

       WILL looks at HENSLOWE in outrage.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                     (apologetically)
                 My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I 
                 have a few debts here and there. Well, 
                 that seems to be everybody. Did you 
                 see a Romeo?

                           WILL
                 I did not.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Well, I to my work, you to yours. When 
                 can I see pages?

                           WILL
                 Tomorrow

       HENSLOWE leaves him.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                     (a prayer)
                 please God.

       WILL sits brooding alone for a moment. Then he realizes 
       he is being addressed from the stage. ANOTHER ACTOR.

                           ACTOR
                 May I begin, sir?

       WILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man, 
       with a hat shadowing his eyes.

                           WILL
                 Your name?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Thomas Kent. I would like to do a 
                 speech by a writer who commands the 
                 heart of every player.

       WILL can hardly manage a nod.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
                 "What light is light, if Silvia be not 
                 seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be 
                 not by? Unless it be to think that she 
                 is by And feed upon the shadow of 
                 perfection.

       It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to 
       confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is 
       VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon 
       gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has 
       found his "ROMEO".

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
                 " except I be by Silvia in the night, 
                 There is no music in the nightingale. 
                 Unless I look on Silvia in the day, 
                 There is no day for me to look upon."

       WILL interrupts "him."

                           WILL
                 Take off your hat.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 My hat?

                           WILL
                 Where did you learn how to do that?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 I . . .

                           WILL
                 Wait there.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Are you Mr. Shakespeare?

                           WILL
                 Let me see you. Take off your hat.

       THOMAS begins to panic. WILL jumps down to ground level. 
       THOMAS runs offstage, to WILL'S bewilderment. WILL 
       hurries after him. We go with WILL as he crosses the 
       stage, then backstage, then into the

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. RETIRING ROOM. DAY.

       RETIRING ROOM which is crowded with actors and HENSLOWE'S 
       lieutenant, property manager, copier, and general 
       factotum who is a new character, PETER.

                           ACTOR
                 What are we playing?

                           NOL
                 Where are the pages?

       WILL enters into the middle of this.

                           WILL
                     (shouts)
                 Where's the boy?

       NOBODY knows what he is talking about. WABASH, the 
       stutterer, grabs Will's hand and shakes it excitedly.

                           WABASH
                 B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!

       The street door is swinging shut. WILL sees it. He fights 
       his way through the men to get to the door.

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BANKSIDE. DAY.

       WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing 
       with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins, 
       tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews 
       (lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time 
       before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded 
       street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.

       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

       When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in 
       a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The 
       river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a 
       number of waiting "taxis." WILL jumps into the nearest 
       one and shouts at the "Taxi Driver" BOATMAN.

                           WILL
                 Follow that boat!

                           BOATMAN
                 Right you are, governor!

       WILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits 
       facing him, rowing lustily.

                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
                 I know your face. Are you an actor?

                           WILL
                     (oh God, here we go again)
                 Yes.

                           BOATMAN
                 Yes, I've seen you in something. That 
                 one about a king.

                           WILL
                 Really?

                           BOATMAN
                 I had the Christopher Marlowe in my 
                 boat once.

       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

       LATER. The BOATMAN is puffing. WILL is looking ahead to 
       where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther 
       shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the 
       north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run 
       toward the house.

                           WILL
                 Do you know that house?

                           BOATMAN
                 Sir Robert De Lesseps.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL runs towards the house.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES'S HOUSE. DAY.

       THOMAS rushes up the back stairs, removing his hat. Her 
       hair tumbles down about her shoulders, so we will call 
       her VIOLA again.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.

       Her mother LADY DE LESSEPS, is talking to the NURSE.

       LADY DE LESSEPS

       Where is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too, 
       bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled 
       tonight.

       Behind her, the door opens revealing VIOLA as THOMAS to 
       the NURSES view, but only for a moment. The door closes 
       again as LADY DE LESSEPS turns.

                           LADY DE LESSEPS (CONT'D)
                 Tomorrow he drags me off to the 
                 country and it will be three weeks 
                 gone before we return from our 
                 estates.

       A different door communicating to the next room, opens 
       and VIOLA comes in after a lightning dress change into a 
       robe. She curtseys to her mother.

                           VIOLA
                 God save you, mother.
                     (to NURSE)
                 Ho water, nurse.

       The NURSE looks at her, round-eyed.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY.

       From a cauldron on the stove, hot water is poured into 
       two pails, by the a KITCHEN BOY under the NURSE'S 
       command.

                           SCULLERY MAID (O.S.)
                 Thomas Kent, sir? No sir.

                           WILL (O.S.)
                 The actor

                           NURSE
                 Who asks for him?

       WILL has come to the kitchen door with a letter.

                           WILL
                 William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and 
                 playwright of the Rose.

       The NURSE sends the SCULLERY MAID back to work.

                           NURSE
                 Master Kent ismy nephew.

                           WILL
                     (giving her the letter)
                 I will wait.

                           NURSE
                 Much god may it do you.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BATHROOM. EVENING.

       VIOLA in her bath, reads WILL'S letter. The NURSE is 
       adding hot water to the tub.

                           VIOLA
                     (delighted)
                 He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, 
                 a young man of Verona.

                           NURSE
                     (unimpressed)
                 Verona again.

                           VIOLA
                     (devouring the letter)
                 A comedy of quarreling families 
                 reconciled in the discovery of Romeo 
                 to be the very same Capulet cousin 
                 stolen from the cradle and fostered to 
                 manhood by his Montague mother that 
                 was robbed of her own child by the 
                 Pirate King!

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

       WILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a 
       SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general 
       direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and 
       escapes a soaking.

                           SERVANT
                 Be off!

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE is helping VIOLA into her party dress.

                           NURSE
                 Your mother, and your father

                           VIOLA
                     (gaily)
                 From tomorrow, away in the country for 
                 three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not 
                 handsome?

                           NURSE
                 He looks well enough for a mountebank.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent 
                 the life of Viola De Lesseps's 
                 dreaming.

                           NURSE
                     (firmly)
                 My lady, this play will end badly. I 
                 will tell.

                           VIOLA
                     (twice as firmly)
                 You will not tell. As you love me and 
                 as I love you, you will bind my breast 
                 and buy me a boy's wig!

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

       WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying 
       instruments. WILL recognizes them.

                           WILL
                 Master Plum! What business here?

                           MUSICIAN
                 A five shilling business, Will. We 
                 play for the dancing.

       The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a 
       GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who 
       have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the 
       house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX 
       skid to a halt and enter the house.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he 
       strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests 
       are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances 
       around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing 
       SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.

                           SERVANT
                 Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's 
                 orders.

                           WILL
                 I seek Master Thomas Kent.

       It means nothing to the SERVANT who moves on. ANGLE ON 
       WESSEX and SIR ROBERT.

                           SIR ROBERT
                 She is a beauty, my lord, as would 
                 take a king to church for a dowry of a 
                 nutmeg.

                           WESSEX
                 My plantations in Virginia are not 
                 mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an 
                 ancient name that will bring you 
                 preferment when your grandson is a 
                 Wessex. Is she fertile?

                           SIR ROBERT
                 She will breed. If she do not, send 
                 her back.

                           WESSEX
                 Is she obedient?

                           SIR ROBERT
                 As any mule in Christendom. But if you 
                 are the man to rider her, their are 
                 rubies in the saddlebag.

                           WESSEX
                 I like her.

       ANGLE on WILL--watching the dancing. Then he sees VIOLA in 
       the crowd. He turns to blood. 
       Love at first sight, no doubt about it. VIOLA has not 
       seen him. She is doing a daughter's duty among her 
       parents' friends. The guests form up to begin a changing-
       partners dance (the very same one you get in every ROMEO 
       and JULIET).

                           WILL
                     (to Musician)
                 By all the stars in heaven, who is 
                 she?

                           MUSICIAN
                 Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.

       WILL leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to 
       keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. VIOLA 
       moves through patterns of the dance untilas night 
       follows day, she finds WILL opposite her. He has 
       insinuated himself into the dance. VIOLA gasps.

                           VIOLA
                 Master Shakespeare

       WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance 
       separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.

                           WESSEX
                 My lady Viola.

                           VIOLA
                 My lord.

                           WESSEX
                 I have spoken with your father.

                           VIOLA
                 So my lord? I speak with him every 
                 day.

       WESSEX scowls. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds 
       herself opposite WILL again. WILL stares at her 
       entranced.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Good sir ?

       WILL has lost his tongue.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 I heard you are a poet.

       WILL nods in his trance and she smiles at him.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 But a poet of no words?

       WILL tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. He 
       is dumb with adoration. Suddenly WESSEX takes him affably 
       by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.

                           WESSEX
                     (smiling evilly)
                 "Poet?"

                           WILL
                     (coming round form the 
                      anaesthetic and not noticing 
                      the danger)
                 I was a poet till now, but I have seen 
                 beauty that puts my poems at one with 
                 the talking ravens at the Tower.

       To his surprise he finds a lordly dagger at this throat.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                     (startled)
                 How do I offend, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                 By coveting my property. I cannot shed 
                 blood in her house but I will cut your 
                 throat anon. You have a name?

                           WILL
                     (gulps)
                 Christopher Marlowe at your service.

       WESSEX shoves him through the nearest door.

       VIOLA'S eyes are searching the room for WILL. She finds 
       WESSEX smiling at her. She looks away.

       EXT. DE LESSEPS' GARDEN/VIOLA'S BALCONY. NIGHT

       There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed 
       for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space. 
       WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room 
       is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto 
       the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her. 
       VIOLA sighs dreamily.

                           VIOLA
                 Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of 
                 Verona. A comedy. By William 
                 Shakespeare.

       WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of 
       hiding, and approaches the balcony.

                           WILL
                     (whispers)
                 My lady!

                           VIOLA
                     (gasps)
                 Who is there?

                           WILL
                 Will Shakespeare!

       The NURSE calls "Madam!" from inside the room.

                           VIOLA
                 Anon, good nurse. Anon.
                     (to WILL)
                 Master Shakespeare?!

                           WILL
                 The same, alas.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh but why "alas?"

                           WILL
                 A lowly player.

                           VIOLA
                 Alas indeed, for I thought you the 
                 highest poet of my esteem and a writer 
                 of plays that capture my heart.

                           WILL
                 Oh--I am him too!

       The NURSE calls again.

                           VIOLA
                     (to NURSE)
                 Anon, anon!
                     (to WILL)
                 I will come again.

       She goes inside for a moment.

                           WILL
                     (to himself)
                 Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be 
                 punished for this!

       VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Oh my lady, my love!

                           VIOLA
                 If they find you here they will kill 
                 you.

                           WILL
                 You can bring them with a word.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, not for the world!

       The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!"

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Anon, nurse!

       But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that 
       there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb 
       up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a 
       soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops 
       his head over the parapet and is face to face with the 
       NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the 
       tree.

       EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

       Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle 
       flames appear in different windows, the garden door is 
       flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one 
       hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top 
       of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He 
       could have written it better.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN.

       WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and 
       metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen 
       sheets. He is inspired.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing 
       pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are 
       looking through their pages.

                           JOHN
                 "Draw if you be men!
                     (to JAMES)
                 Gregory, remember thy washing blow."

                           NOL
                 "Part, fools, put up your swords."

       WILL is going around pumping hands and slapping 
       shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading 
       his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him.

                           HENSLOWE
                 It starts well, and then it's all long-
                 faced about some Rosaline. Where's the 
                 comedy, Will. Where's the dog?
                     (to RALPH)
                 Do you think it is funny?

                           RALPH
                 I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. 
                 That's funny

       WILL pulls HENSLOWE aside.

                           WILL
                 We are at least six men short, and 
                 those we have will be overparted, 
                 ranters and stutterers who should be 
                 sent back to the stews. My Romeo has 
                 let me down. I see disaster.

                           HENSLOWE
                 We are at least four acts short, Will, 
                 if you are looking for disaster.

       WILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor, 
       the URCHIN we met before.

                           WILL
                 Who are you, master?

                           URCHIN
                 I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's 
                 daughter.

                           WILL
                     (furiously)
                 I'll be damned if you are!

       And he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN 
       glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to 
       face with FENNYMAN.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Is it going well?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Very well.

                           FENNYMAN
                 But nothing is happening.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Yes, but very well.

                           WILL
                     (shouts)
                 Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Who is that?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Nobody. The author.

                           WILL
                 We are about to embark on a great 
                 voyage.

                           HENSLOWE
                 It is customary to make a little 
                 speech on the first day. It does no 
                 harm and authors like it.

                           WILL
                 You want to know what parts you are to 
                 receive. All will be settled as we go

       That's as far as he gets before there is a dramatic 
       interruption--the public entrance door is flung open and 
       SIX MEN make a loud entrance, headed by NED ALLEYN, the 
       actor, who is a handsome piratical figure with a big 
       voice and a big sword.

                           ALLEYN
                 Huzzah! The Admiral's Men are returned 
                 to the house!

       He gets various reactions. HENSLOWE and WILL shout his 
       name joyfully, some of the actors are friends with the 
       new group and behave accordingly, others know they are 
       out of a job. FENNYMAN recovers, or tries to.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Who is this?

       ALLEYN slaps him aside with his sword.

                           ALLEYN
                     (roars)
                 Silence, you god! I am Hieronimo! I am 
                 Tamburlaine! I am Faustus! I am 
                 Barrabas, the Jew of Malta--of yes, 
                 Master Will, and I am Henry VI. What 
                 is the play, and what is my part?

       FENNYMAN is impressed.

                           FENNYMAN
                 A moment, sir!

                           ALLEYN
                     (roars)
                 Who are you?

                           FENNYMAN
                     (bleating)
                 I am the money!

                           ALLEYN
                 Then you may remain so long as you 
                 remain silent. Pay attention and you 
                 will see how genius creates a legend.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (respectfully)
                 Thank you, sir.

                           WILL
                 We are in desperate want of a 
                 Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of 
                 Verona

                           ALLEYN
                 And the title of this piece?

                           WILL
                 Mercutio

                           HENSLOWE
                 Is it?

                           ALLEYN
                 I will play him!

       Half a dozen of the ADMIRAL'S MEN will be given roles in 
       our play and we meet them and identify them as WILL 
       enthusiastically shakes hands.

                           WILL
                 Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, 
                 George Bryan! James Armitage!
                     (and now greeting SAM GOSSE, 
                      the female star of the 
                      Admiral's Men)
                 Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to 
                 fall in love again?

                           SAM
                     (hoarsely)
                 I am, Master Shakespeare.

                           WILL
                     (concerned)
                 But your voice
                     (he thrust a hand between 
                      SAM'S legs)
                 Have they dropped?

                           SAM
                     (a girlie voice now)
                 No, no, a touch of cold only. We 
                 suspect he is lying but WILL has 
                 turned away.

                           WILL
                 Master Henslowe, you have your actors.

       He leaves, passing by the humbled FENNYMAN.

                           FENNYMAN
                 I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. 
                 Wonderful.

                           WILL
                 Yes, I saw it.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Of course, it was mighty writing. 
                 There is no one like Marlowe

       WILL is used to it. He goes.

       EXT. RIVERBANK. DAY.

       WILL arrives in a hurry at the wharfside, and looks 
       vainly in the direction of the DE LESSEPSES' house: no 
       THOMAS.

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE DOOR. DAY.

       WILL looks down the alley:--no THOMAS. He turns away. The 
       URCHIN, the short-lived Ethel, is sitting in the alley.

                           WILL
                 Better fortune, boy.

                           URCHIN
                     (shrugs)
                 I was in a play. They cut my head off 
                 in Titus Andronicus. When I write 
                 plays, they will be like Titus.

                           WILL
                     (pleased)
                 You admire it?

       The URCHIN nods grimly.

                           URCHIN
                 I like it when they cut heads off. And 
                 the daughter mutilated with knives.

                           WILL
                 Oh. What is your name?

                           URCHIN.
                 John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty.

       Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest. 
       The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches 
       the result with sober interest.

                           URCHIN (CONT'D)
                 Plenty of blood. That is the only 
                 writing.

       WILL backs away, unnerved by the boy.

                           URCHIN (CONT'D)
                 Wait, you'll see the cat bites his 
                 head off.

                           WILL
                 I have to get back.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       On stage . . . the actors carry their parts.

       NOL AS BENVOLIO

       "See where he comes. So please you step aside; I'll know 
       his grievance or be much denied."

                           MONTAGUE
                 "I would thou wert so happy by thy 
                 stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam, 
                 let's away."

       Onstage "MONTAGUE" and "LADY MONTAGUE" make their exit. 
       Offstage, WILL appears next to HENSLOWE.

                           WILL
                 Cut round him for now.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (not understanding)
                 What? Who?

                           WILL
                 Romeo.

                           HENSLOWE
                 The one who came with your letter?

                           WILL
                 What?

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO (O.S.)
                 "Good morrow, cousin."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO (O.S.)
                 "Is the day so young?"

       The voice is THOMAS'S. WILL turns back to the stage and 
       sees him. Today THOMAS has a wig as well as his small 
       mustache.

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "But new struck nine."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that 
                 my father that went hence so fast?"

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's 
                 hours?"

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Not having that which, having, makes 
                 them short."

                           WILL
                 Good

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "In love?"

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Out."

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "Of love?"

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Out of her favour where I am in 
                 love."

                           WILL
                     (interrupting)
                 No, no, noDon't spend it all at once!

       The rehearsal stops.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Yes, sir.

                           WILL
                 Do you understand me?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 No, sir.

                           WILL
                 He is speaking about a baggage we 
                 never even meet! What will be left in 
                 your purse when he meets his Juliet?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Juliet? You mean Ethel.

                           WILL
                     (rounding on him)
                 God's teeth, am I to suffer this 
                 constant stream of interruption?!
                     (to THOMAS)
                 What will you do in Act Two when he 
                 meets the love of his life?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (timidly--looking through his 
                      few sheets of paper)
                 I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen 
                 Act Two.

                           WILL
                 Of course you have not! I have not 
                 written it!

       Alone in the auditorium, FENNYMAN looks and listens, 
       fascinated. So this is theatre!

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Go once more!

       NED ALLEYN comes out of the wings, frowning over his 
       manuscript.

                           ALLEYN
                 WillWhere is Mercutio?

                           WILL
                     (tapping his forehead)
                 Locked safe in here. I leave the scene 
                 in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a 
                 sonnet to write.

       WILL moves back into the wings where HENSLOWE is looking 
       anxious.

                           HENSLOWE
                 A sonnet? You mean a play.

       WILL moves on, ignoring him. As he goes, we see that 
       VIOLA is love-struck by him, a riot in the heart.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. STAIRCASE. DAY.

       VIOLA still dressed as THOMAS, sonnet in hand, runs up 
       the stairs to her room. From the other end of the house 
       WESSEX can be heard ranting.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT.

       LORD WESSEX is being kept waiting. The NURSE is bearing 
       the brunt of his impatience.

                           WESSEX
                 Two hours at prayer!

                           NURSE
                 Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at 
                 prayer is not piety, it is self-
                 importance!

                           NURSE
                 It would be better that you return 
                 tomorrow, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 It would be better that you tell her 
                 to get off her knees and show some 
                 civility to her six-day lord and 
                 master.

       VIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too 
       hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her 
       bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately, 
       the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming 
       forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola 
       from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S 
       presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by 
       VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has 
       disappeared.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 My lady VIOLA.

                           VIOLA
                 Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.

                           WESSEX
                 I am aware of it, but it is beauty's 
                 privilege.

                           VIOLA
                 You flatter, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 No. I have spoken to the Queen.
                     (pause)
                 Her majesty's consent is requisite 
                 when a Wessex takes a wife, and once 
                 gained, her consent is her command.

                           VIOLA
                 Do you intend to marry, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                 Your father should keep you better 
                 informed. He has bought me for you. He 
                 returns from his estates to see us 
                 married two weeks from Saturday.
                     (pause)
                 You are allowed to show your pleasure.

                           VIOLA
                 I do not love you, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 How your mind hops about! Your father 
                 was a shopkeeper, your children will 
                 bear arms, and I will recover my 
                 fortune. That is the only matter under 
                 discussion today. You will like 
                 Virginia.

                           VIOLA
                 Virginia?!

                           WESSEX
                 Why, yes! My fortune lies in my 
                 plantations. The tobacco weed. I need 
                 four thousand pounds to fit out a ship 
                 and put my investments to work--I fancy 
                 tobacco has a future. We will not stay 
                 there long, three or four years . . .

                           VIOLA
                 But why me?

                           WESSEX
                 It was your eyes. No, your lips.

       He kisses her with more passion than ceremony. VIOLA 
       recoils, and slaps him.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 Will you defy your father and your 
                 Queen?

                           VIOLA
                 The Queen has consented?

                           WESSEX
                 She wants to inspect you. At 
                 Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, 
                 modest, grateful and brief.

                           VIOLA
                     (forced to submit)
                 I will do my duty, my lord.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       She is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table. 
       We can read part of it. "Shall I compare thee to a 
       summer's day"

       Now we see what VIOLA is writing.

       INSERT: "Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech 
       you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a 
       daughter's duty "

       She sheds a romantic, unhappy tear.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I 
       Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and 
       "JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners 
       dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge.

                           ALLEYN
                 Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!

       The dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault.

                           ALLEYN (CONT'D)
                     (furious)
                 Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! 
                 Are you a lady, Mr. Kent?

       THOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the 
       bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to 
       PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an 
       argument.

                           WILL
                     (preempting)
                 You did not like the speech?

                           ALLEYN
                 The speech is excellent.
                     (he does the first line 
                      impressively)
                 "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been 
                 with you!" Excellent and a good 
                 length. But then he disappears for the 
                 length of a bible.

       WILL points significantly at the pages he has given 
       PETER.

                           WILL
                 There you have his duel, a skirmish of 
                 words and swords such as I never 
                 wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such 
                 passion and poetry as your ever heard: 
                 "a plague on both your houses!"

       NED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns 
       back.

                           ALLEYN
                 He dies?

       But the author has escaped.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

       Up aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down 
       to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round 
       in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the 
       floor. That done, he picks up his pen.

       EXT. STREET. NIGHT.

       WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into 
       BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern.

                           BURBAGE
                 Will!

       WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls 
       after him.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                 And where are my pages . . .

       WILL hurries on.

       EXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK.

       VIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From 
       behind, in the direction of Bankside, "he" hears 
       shouting.

                           WILL
                     (O.S. shouting)
                 Did you give her my letter?

       VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind, 
       following in another boat. She takes a letter from her 
       coat and holds it aloft.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (calling)
                 And this for you.

       EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.

       WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open 
       the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He 
       collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.

                           WILL
                 Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I 
                 am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, 
                 like a puppet in a box.

                           BOATMAN
                 Writer, is he?

       WILL turns on him savagely

                           WILL
                 Row your boat.

       EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.

       WILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation 
       intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The 
       BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore 
       him.

                           WILL
                 She tells me to keep away. She is to 
                 marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 If you love her, you must do what she 
                 asks.

                           WILL
                 And break her heart and mine?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 It is only ours you can know.

                           WILL
                 She loves me, Thomas!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Does she say so?

                           WILL
                 No. And yet she does where the ink has 
                 run with tears. Was she weeping when 
                 she gave you this?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 I  Her letter came to me by the 
                 nurse.

                           WILL
                 Your aunt?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (catching up)
                 Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a 
                 little. Tell me how you love her, 
                 Will.

                           WILL
                 Like a sickness and its cure together.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and 
                 heat.
                     (collecting herself)
                 Is your lady beautiful? Since I came 
                 to visit from the country, I have not 
                 seen her close. Tell me, is she 
                 beautiful?

                           WILL
                 Oh, if I could write the beauty of her 
                 eyes! I was born to look in them and 
                 know myself.

       He is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but 
       WILL belies his words.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 And her lips?

                           WILL
                 Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early 
                 morning rose would wither on the 
                 branch, if it could feel envy!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 And her voice? Like lark song?

                           WILL
                 Deeper. Softer. None of your 
                 twittering larks! I would banish 
                 nightingales from her garden before 
                 they interrupt her song.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 She sings too?

                           WILL
                 Constantly. Without doubt. And plays 
                 the lute, she has a natural ear. And 
                 her bosom--did I mention her bosom?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (glinting)
                 What of her bosom?

                           WILL
                 Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round 
                 and rare as golden apples!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 I think the lady is wise to keep your 
                 love at a distance. For what lady 
                 could live up to it close to, when her 
                 eyes and lips and voice may be no more 
                 beautiful than mine? Besides, can a 
                 lady born to wealth and noble marriage 
                 love happily with a Bankside poet and 
                 player?

                           WILL
                     (fervently)
                 Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of 
                 rank or riverbank! It will spark 
                 between a queen and the poor vagabond 
                 who plays the king, and their love 
                 should be minded by each, for love 
                 denied blights the soul we owe to God! 
                 So tell my lady, William Shakespeare 
                 waits for her in the garden!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 But what of Lord Wessex?

                           WILL
                 For one kiss, I would defy a thousand 
                 Wessexes!

       The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house. 
       The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her 
       round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her. 
       The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth 
       and jumps out of the boat.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, Will!

       She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the 
       house.

                           BOATMAN
                 Thank you, my lady!

                           WILL
                     (stunned)
                 Lady?

                           BOATMAN
                 Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she 
                 was this high. Wouldn't deceive a 
                 child.

       WILL gets out of the boat.

                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
                     (reaching under his seat)
                 Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a 
                 writer myself.

       The BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript.

                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)
                 It wouldn't take you long to read it, 
                 I expect you know all the booksellers 
                 . . .

       But WILL has gone.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' GARDEN. NIGHT.

       WILL drops over the wall into the garden and without 
       hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL comes in through the window, just as VIOLA enters by 
       the door. They stare at each other across the room.

                           WILL
                 Can you love a fool?

                           VIOLA
                 Can you love a player?

       They run together and fall into a passionate kiss.

                           WILL
                     (springs back)
                 Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps 
                 as mistook in me as I was mistook in 
                 Thomas Kent.

                           VIOLA
                 Answer me only this: are you the 
                 author of the plays of William 
                 Shakespeare?

                           WILL
                 I am.

                           VIOLA
                 Then kiss me again for I am not 
                 mistook.

       They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA 
       fumbles with his clothing, he with hers.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 I do not know how to undress a man.

                           WILL
                 It is strange to me, too.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE has come to listen. She puts her ear against 
       the door. Because she hears muffled voices, she looks 
       startled.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and 
       chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside. 
       He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she 
       is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose 
       end and spins her naked.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom 
       door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping 
       guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of 
       VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her 
       little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes 
       along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is 
       dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of 
       the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to 
       rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from 
       within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE. The NURSE 
       stares at the CHAMBERMAID.

                           NURSE
                 Go to, go to.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

       WILL and VIOLA have finished making love, and lie in each 
       other's arms.

                           VIOLA
                 I would not have thought it. There is 
                 something better than a play.

                           WILL
                 There is.

                           VIOLA
                 Even your play.

                           WILL
                     (frowns)
                 Oh

                           VIOLA
                 And that was only my first try.

                           WILL
                 Well perhaps better than my first.
                     (he kisses her again)

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAWN.

       Dawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with 
       envious streaks.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN

       The NURSE has fallen asleep in her rocking chair.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.

       A rooster crows at some distance. VIOLA and WILL are in 
       bed. She stirs drowsily. VIOLA, coming awake, speaks his 
       name and he kisses her.

                           VIOLA
                 Will

       Then he starts to get out of bed.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 You would not leave me?

                           WILL
                 I must. Look-- how pale the window.

                           VIOLA
                     (pulling him down)
                 Moonlight!

                           WILL
                 No, the morning rooster woke me.

                           VIOLA
                 It was the owl--come to bed

       She is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes 
       around them.

                           WILL
                     (giving in)
                 Oh, let Henslowe wait.

                           VIOLA
                     (pausing, pushing him away)
                 Mr. Henslowe?

                           WILL
                     (persisting)
                 Let him be damned for his pages!

                           VIOLA
                 Oh--no, no!

                           WILL
                     (kissing her)
                 There is time. It is still dark.

                           VIOLA
                 It is broad day!
                     (the rooster crows again)
                 The rooster tells us so!

                           WILL
                 It was the owl. Believe me, love, it 
                 was the owl.

       He kisses her and starts to make love to her again. VIOLA 
       gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor. She 
       sits up and pulls on her gown.

                           VIOLA
                 You would leave us players without a 
                 scene to read today?!

       There's a knock at the door.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VIOLA'S 
       BEDROOM/VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.

       The NURSE is knocking. VIOLA comes to the door.

                           NURSE
                 My lady, the house is stirring, it is 
                 a new day.

       VIOLA looks beautified by the hours that have passed.

                           VIOLA
                 It is a new world!

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The cut is to the middle of a rehearsal. We are coming up 
       to the moment when "ROMEO" and "JULIET" kiss for the 
       first time (Act I Scene V) NED ALLEYN is in charge but 
       WILL is watching. His life has turned perfect.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Have not saints lips, and holy 
                 palmers too?"

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use 
                 in prayer."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what 
                 hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest 
                 faith turn to despair."

       WILL is in her eye-line. Her eyes flash an intimate 
       secret look to him.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Saints do not move, though grant for 
                 prayer's sake."

       And VIOLA misses her cue as a result.

                           SAM
                     (prompting her)
                 It's you.

                           ALLEYN
                     (roars)
                 Suffering cats!

       VIOLA guiltily picks up her line.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Then move not, while my prayer's 
                 effect I take."

       In character, VIOLA kisses SAM, demurely, but apparently 
       not demurely enough for WILL, who gives a twitch.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO(CONT'D)
                 "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin 
                 is purg'd."

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Then have my lips the sin that they 
                 have took."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly 
                 urg'd. Give me my sin again."

       VIOLA kisses SAM again. WILL gives a major twitch, which 
       in fact catapults his body onto the stage. Everybody 
       looks at him in surprise.

                           WILL
                 Yesyesernot quite rightit is more 
                 let me
                     (as JULIET)
                 "Then have my lips the sin that they 
                 have took."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly 
                 urg'd. Give me my sin again."

       VIOLA kisses WILL. They lose themselves for a fraction of 
       a moment. As VIOLA withdraws her lips, WILL'S lips are 
       going for it again.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO (CONT'D)
                 "You kiss by th' book."

                           ALLEYN
                     (to Will, sarcastically)
                 Well! It was lucky you were here! Why 
                 do not I write the rest of your play 
                 while you

                           WILL
                     (apologising, retreating)
                 Yes, yescontinue. Now the Nurse. 
                 Where is Ralph?

       RALPH has been ready and waiting.

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Madam, your mother craves a word with 
                 you."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "What is her mother?"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Marry bachelor, Her mother is the 
                 lady of the house"

       WILL has retreated to

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       He is behind the curtain now.

                           RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)
                 "And a good lady, and wise and 
                 virtuous. I nurse her daughter that 
                 you talk'd withal"

       During RALPH'S lines (which are continuous) WILL stands 
       in the shadow behind the curtain, alone, agitated.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       RALPH AS NURSE

       "I tell you, he that can lay hold of her (he makes the 
       money sign) Shall have the chinks."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Is she a Capulet" Oh dear account. My 
                 life is my foe's debt."

       NOL, AS "BENVOLIO," at a party, carrying a goblet, tipsy, 
       enters the scene.

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                     (to ROMEO)
                 "Away, be gone, the sport is at best."

       VIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the 
       curtain at the gap.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

       WILL is kissing her hand.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Ay, so I fear; the more is my 
                 unrest."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

       VIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss, 
       dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the 
       general backstage area.

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 "Come hither nurse. What is yond 
                 gentleman?"

                           VIOLA
                     (to Will)
                 Oh let it be night!

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "I know not."

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Go ask his name--If he be married, My 
                 grave is like to be my wedding bed."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

       "JULIET'S" line bits WILL between the eyes. WILL pulls 
       away.

                 Oh, do not go

                           WILL
                 I must. I must

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       As WILL races up the ladder to his writer's corner, the 
       rehearsal can be heard continuing.

                           RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)
                 "His name is Romeo, and a Montague, 
                 The only son of your great enemy."

                           ALLEYN (O.S.)
                     (roaring from the audience)
                 Terrible!

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

       WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's 
       corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands 
       together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all 
       over the table. 
       We take a peak at the lines he has already written. 
       INSERT MANUSCRIPT: "But soft, what light through yonder 
       window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun." 
       VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line.

                           VIOLA (VO)
                 "But soft, what light through yonder 
                 window breaks? It is the east and 
                 Juliet is the sun!"

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

                           VIOLA
                     (reading)
                 "Arise fair sun and kill the envious 
                 moon Who is already sick and pale with 
                 grief That thou her maid art far more 
                 fair than she"

       VIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript 
       page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Oh, Will!

                           WILL
                 Yes, some of it is speakable.

       She has to speak through WILL'S kisses, he is nibbling at 
       her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with 
       the pages.

                           VIOLA
                     (continuing reading)
                 "It is my lady, O it is my love! O 
                 that she knew she were!"

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       VIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in 
       rehearsal, with SAM as "JULIET" sighing on the balcony 
       above her.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "The brightness of her cheek would 
                 shame those stars As daylight doth a 
                 lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through 
                 the airy region stream so bright That 
                 birds would sing and think it were not 
                 night. See how she leans her cheek 
                 upon her hand. O that I were a glove 
                 upon that hand, That I might touch 
                 that cheek.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                     (above)
                 "Ay me."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "She speaks.

       Oh speak again bright angel"

       We have abandoned real time. The scene continues CROSS 
       CUT between the STAGE and VIOLA'S BED.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

                           WILL
                     (reading through VIOLA'S 
                      kisses)
                 "Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou 
                 Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy 
                 name."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my 
                 love And I'll no longer be a Capulet."

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                     (below)
                 "Shall I hear more or shall I speak at 
                 this?"

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL and VIOLA in bed.

                           WILL
                 "What man art thou that thus 
                 bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my 
                 counsel?"

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. NIGHT.

       It's become late and the rehearsal is continuing by 
       torchlight.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "By a name I know not how to tell 
                 thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is 
                 hateful to myself Because it is an 
                 enemy to thee"

       We see that a group of the other actors have drifted "out 
       front," drawn by the scene. FENNYMAN is there entranced. 
       Clearly, this stuff is a cut above the normal.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

       WILL, undressed, strides around the room, feeding 
       "JULIET'S" lines to VIOLA in bed.

                           WILL
                 "The orchard walls are high and hard 
                 to climb, And the place death, 
                 considering who thou art, If any of my 
                 kinsmen find thee here. If they do see 
                 thee, they will murder thee."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. NIGHT.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Alack, there lies more peril in thine 
                 eye, Than twenty of their swords! Look 
                 thou but sweet, And I am proof against 
                 their enmity."

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 I would not for the world!

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 I have night's cloak to hide me from 
                 their eyes; And but thou love me, let 
                 them find me here.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL and VIOLA are both out of bed, halfway though 
       dressing. Still rehearsing.

                           WILL
                 "Good night, good night. As sweet 
                 repose and rest Come to thy heart as 
                 that within my breast. O wilt thou 
                 leave me so unsatisfied?"

                           VIOLA
                 That's my line!

                           WILL
                 Oh, but it is mine too!

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. NIGHT.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "What satisfaction can'st thou have 
                 tonight?"

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "The exchange of thy love's faithful 
                 vow for mine."

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL and VIOLA are back on the bed, kissing and making 
       love.

                           WILL
                 "My bounty is as boundless as the sea, 
                 My love as deep:

                           VIOLA AND WILL
                     (continuing the speech with 
                      him)
                 the more I give to thee The more I 
                 have, for both are infinite."

       Outside the NURSE is knocking on the door and calling.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "I hear some noise within. Dear love, 
                 adieu."

       RALPH, the Nurse, call's "JULIET!" off stage.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

                           VIOLA
                     (calling to the NURSE who is 
                      outside)
                 Anon, good Nurse

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       The NURSE listens at the door.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Anon, good Nurse--Sweet Montague be 
                 true."

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

                           WILL
                 "Stay but a little, I will come 
                 again."

       VIOLA slaps him playfully for his vulgarity, and then 
       kisses him.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Stay but a little, I will come 
                 again."

       SAM leaves the balcony through the curtain.

                           VIOLA AS ROMEO
                 "Oh blessed blessed night."

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       It is night. They have just made love. Suddenly it is 
       very still.

                           VIOLA
                     (almost to herself)
                 "I am feared,

       Being in night, all this but a dream, Too flattering-
       sweet to be substantial."

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       Onstage, the scene continues. Backstage NED ALLEYN is 
       working his way upstairs. He passes by RALPH (the Nurse) 
       who has a couple of words "of," as it were, in "JULIET'S" 
       chamber.

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 "All my fortunes at thy foot I'll 
                 lay, And follow thee my lord 
                 throughout the world."

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Madam!"

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 "I come, anon--But if thou meanest not 
                 well, I do beseech thee--"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Madam!"

                           SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
                 By and by I come to cease thy strife 
                 and leave me to my grief. A thousand 
                 times good night!"

       SAM exits (i.e. enters to us) through the curtain.

                           SAM
                     (to NED)
                 I cannot move in this dress! and it 
                 makes me look like a pig! I have no 
                 neck in this pig dress!
                     (and then hearing his cue 
                      from "ROMEO")
                 Oh, she's off again! She says she's 
                 going and then she doesn't

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

       NED is arriving. WILL is busy writing. PETER is there, 
       holding the pages WILL has completed, and waiting for 
       WILL to finish his page. PETER is reading his pages. WILL 
       sees NED arrive. He gives his page to PETER.

                           WILL
                     (to PETER)
                 How is it?

                           PETER
                     (shrugs)
                 It's all right.

       Typical!, says WILL'S face. Peter departs, leaving the 
       field to NED. WILL braces himself.

                           WILL
                 NedI knowI know

                           ALLEYN
                 It's good.

                           WILL
                 Oh

                           ALLEYN
                 The title won't do.

                           WILL
                 Ah

                           ALLEYN
                 Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.

                           WILL
                 Thank you, Ned.

       The whole exchange is in ironic code, between old 
       soldiers. NED nods curtly and turns to descend.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 You are a gentleman.

                           ALLEYN
                 And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       PETER is just handing the pages HENSLOWE in the 
       auditorium. HENSLOWE has acquired a performing dog. The 
       dog does somersaults tirelessly. As PETER hands over the 
       pages, he shakes his head.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (in disbelief)
                 You mean, no dog of any kind?

       FENNYMAN, the born-again theatre groupie shushes HENSLOWE 
       and looks daggers at him.

                           PETER
                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 The Friar married them in secret, then 
                 Ned gets into a fight with one of the 
                 Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he 
                 gets in Ned's way, I mean in 
                 Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills 
                 Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt. 
                 Then the Prince banishes him from 
                 Verona.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (much relieved)
                 That must be when he goes on the 
                 voyage and gets shipwrecked on the 
                 island of the Pirate King.

       FENNYMAN can't hear it. He storms over. Kicks the dog, 
       roars at HENSLOWE .

                           FENNYMAN
                 Cease your prattling! Get out!
                     (to the stage where the 
                      action has paused)
                 A thousand apologies!

                           SAM AS JULIET
                 "Good night, good night. Parting is 
                 such sweet sorrow That I shall say 
                 good night till it be morrow."

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.

       A sunbeam wakes the lovers. Sunday morning. Church bells. 
       VIOLA wakes with a start. Something is bothering her, she 
       can't think what. WILL calms her.

                           WILL
                 Sundayit is Sunday.

       He brings her back down to the pillow.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I found something in my sleep. The 
                 Friar who married them will take up 
                 their destinies.

                           VIOLA
                 Oh, but it will end well for love?

                           WILL
                 In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy 
                 I am writing now. A broad river 
                 divides my lovers--family, duty, 
                 fate--as unchangeable as nature.

                           VIOLA
                     (sobered)
                 Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a 
                 stolen season.

       Suddenly there is a great racket heard from downstairsa 
       man shouting.

                           WESSEX (O.S.)
                 Not ready? Where is she?

                           NURSE (O.S.)
                 Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.

                           WESSEX (O.S.)
                 Will you ask Her Majesty to be 
                 patient?!

       VIOLA remembers. She jumps up and gives a cry.

                           VIOLA
                 Sunday! Greenwich!

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. 
       MORNING.

       The NURSE is barring the stairs to WESSEX.

                           WESSEX
                 Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen, 
                 Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel, 
                 the Radiant One, who shines her light 
                 on us, is at Greenwich today, and 
                 prepared, during the evening's 
                 festivities, to bestow her gracious 
                 favour on my choice of wife--and if 
                 we're late for lunch, the old boot 
                 will not forgive. So you get you to my 
                 lady's chamber and produce her with or 
                 without her undergarments.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.

       VIOLA has her dress on and is putting on her shoes. WILL, 
       in his underwear is in mid-argument.

                           WILL
                 You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!

                           VIOLA
                 What will you have me do? Marry you 
                 instead?

                           WILL
                     (brought up short)
                 To be the wife of a poor player?--can I 
                 wish that for Lady Viola, except in my 
                 dreams? And yet I would, if I were 
                 free to follow my desire in the harsh 
                 light of day.

                           VIOLA
                     (tartly)
                 You follow your desire freely enough 
                 in the night. So, if that is all, to 
                 Greenwich I go.

                           WILL
                 Then I will go with you.

                           VIOLA
                 You cannot, Wessex will kill you

                           WILL
                 I know how to fight!

                           VIOLA
                     (now fixing her hair)
                 Stage fighting!
                     (turn to him)
                 Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart 
                 belongs to you but as Viola the river 
                 divides us, and I will marry Wessex a 
                 week from Saturday.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM 
       DOWNSTAIRS HALL. MORNING.

       The ranting from WESSEX has continued

                           WESSEX
                     (ranting)
                 By heaven, I will drag her down, by 
                 the Queen's command

       And is cut off short as VIOLA'S door opens at the top of 
       the stairs.

                           VIOLA
                 Good morning, my lord!

                           WESSEX
                     (impressed by her appearance)
                 Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no 
                 man, but I swear it would wait for 
                 you!

       VIOLA comes down the stairs. Behind her WILL appears 
       gowned and bonneted. He has also assumed a country 
       accent.

                           WILL
                 Here we come at last, my lord!

                           WESSEX
                     (taken aback)
                 Are you bringing your laundry woman?

                           WILL
                 Her chaperone. My lady's country 
                 cousin.
                     (arriving with a curtsey)
                 My, but you be a handsome gallant, 
                 just as she said! You may call me Miss 
                 Wilhelmina!

                           WESSEX
                 On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps

                           WILL
                 Oh, my lord, you will not shake me 
                 off, she never needed me more, I sear 
                 by your breeches!

       EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. NIGHT.

       Fireworks explode in the evening sky over Greenwich, a 
       royal palace, crowded now with noble guests.

       EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. TERRACE. NIGHT.

       The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, 
       chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while 
       QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes 
       through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with 
       a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the 
       best chairwhere she establishes a headquarters. Her 
       current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to 
       a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the 
       next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and 
       bowing as they are greeted by people who know themWill, 
       in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until 
       VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The 
       QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.

                           WESSEX
                     (to him)
                 Now?

                           LORD IN WAITING
                 Now.

                           WESSEX
                     (to Viola)
                 The Queen asks for you. Answer well.

       The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL 
       starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 Is there a man?

                           WILL
                 A man, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                     (impatiently)
                 There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, 
                 I heard--does he come to the house?

                           WILL
                 A theatre poet?

                           WESSEX
                 An insolent penny-a-page rogue, 
                 Marlowe, he said, Christopher 
                 Marlowe--has he been to the house?

                           WILL
                 Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely 
                 waistcoat, shame about the poetry.

                           WESSEX
                     (venomously)
                 That dog!

       ANGLE on the QUEEN.

       The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks 
       from a frozen curtsey.

                           VIOLA
                 Your Majesty.

                           QUEEN
                 Stand up straight, girl.

       VIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 I have seen you. You are the one who 
                 comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, 
                 at Richmond.

                           VIOLA
                     (agreeing)
                 Your Majesty.

                           QUEEN
                 What do you love so much?

                           VIOLA
                 Your Majesty

                           QUEEN
                 Speak out! I know who I am. Do you 
                 love stories of kings and queens? 
                 Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?

                           VIOLA
                 I love theatre. To have stories acted 
                 for me by a company of fellows is 
                 indeed

                           QUEEN
                     (interrupting)
                 They are not acted for you, they are 
                 acted for me.

       VIOLA remains silent, in apology.

       ANGLE on WILL.

       He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN 
       so close. He is fascinated.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 And--?

                           VIOLA
                 And I love poetry above all.

                           QUEEN
                 Above Lord Wessex?

       She looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX 
       has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (to WESSEX)
                 My Lord--when you cannot find your wife 
                 you had better look for her at the 
                 playhouse.

       The COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 But playwrights teach nothing about 
                 love, they make it pretty, they make 
                 it comical, or they make it lust. They 
                 cannot make it true.

                           VIOLA
                     (blurts)
                 Oh, but they can!

       She has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN 
       considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they 
                 have not, but I believe there is one 
                 who can

                           WESSEX
                 Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your 
                 Majesty is wise in it. 
                 Nature and truth are the very enemies 
                 of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

                           QUEEN
                 I thought you were here because you 
                 had none.

       Titters again. WESSEX could kill somebody.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (by way of dismissing him)
                 Well, no one will take your wager, it 
                 seems.

                           WILL
                 Fifty pounds!

       Shock and horror. QUEEN ELIZABETH is the only person 
       amused.

                           QUEEN
                 Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a 
                 very worthy question. Can a play show 
                 us the very truth and nature of love? 
                 I bear witness to the wager, and will 
                 be the judge of it as occasion arises.
                     (which wins a scatter of 
                      applause. She gathers her 
                      skirts and stands)
                 I have not seen anything to settle it 
                 yet.
                     (she moves away, everybody 
                      bowing and scraping)
                 So--the fireworks will be soothing 
                 after the excitements of Lady Viola's 
                 audience.
                     (and now she is next to 
                      WESSEX who is bowing low. 
                      Intimately to him)
                 Have her then, but you are a lordly 
                 fool. She has been plucked since I saw 
                 her last, and not by you. It takes a 
                 woman to know it.

       The QUEEN passes by, and as WESSEX comes vertical again, 
       we see his face a mask of furious realisation.

                           WESSEX
                     (to himself)
                 Marlowe!

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. ENTRANCE. DAY.

       CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE shuts the door behind him. Above him, 
       the ceiling creaks to the rhythm of copulation. He has a 
       sheaf of manuscript pages in his hand. He goes to the 
       stairs.

                           MARLOWE
                 Burbage!

       The creaking stops.

                           BURBAGE'S VOICE
                 Who's there?

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. STAIRS. DAY.

       MARLOWE ascends.

                           MARLOWE
                 Marlowe.

                           BURBAGE'S VOICE
                 Kit!

       INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.

       MARLOWE enters, ignoring the situation on the bed where 
       ROSALINE is astride BURBAGE.

                           MARLOWE
                 You are playing my Faustus this 
                 afternoon. Don't spend yourself in 
                 sport.

                           ROSALINE
                     (working hard)
                 This afternoon!--we'll still be here 
                 this afternoon.

                           BURBAGE
                 What do you want, Kit?

                           MARLOWE
                 My Massacre at Paris is complete.

                           BURBAGE
                 You have the last act?

                           MARLOWE
                 You have the money?

                           BURBAGE
                 Tomorrow.

                           MARLOWE
                     (leaving)
                 Then tomorrow you will have the pages.

                           BURBAGE
                 Wait!
                     (to ROSALINE)
                 Will you desist!

                           MARLOWE
                 Twenty pounds on delivery

                           BURBAGE
                 What is money to me like us? Besides, 
                 if I need a play, I have another 
                 waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

                           MARLOWE
                 Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.

                           BURBAGE
                 Never!

                           MARLOWE
                 Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my 
                 respects, Miss Rosaline.

                           BURBAGE
                 I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for 
                 Romeo!

                           MARLOWE
                     (leaving)
                 You did. But Ned Alleyn and the 
                 Admiral's Men have the playing of it 
                 as the Rose.

                           BURBAGE
                 Treachery!

       BURBAGE rouses himself violently, throwing ROSALINE off 
       the bed. The glass bracelet is flung from her wrist. It 
       breaks on the floor, releasing a strip of paper. BURBAGE 
       picks it up. What he reads on it does not please him: it 
       is WILL'S signature.

                           BURBAGE (CONT'D)
                 Traitor and thief!

       EXT. STREETS. DAY.

       BURBAGE and a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEND are 
       cleaving a path through the crowds. Their faces are grim.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM/UNDER THE STAGE. 
       DAY.

       We are in Act III Scene I. NED ALLEYN as "MERCUTIO" and 
       NOL as "BENVOLIO", and two "MONTAGUE" sidekicks are in 
       occupation of the stage, when the "CAPULETS" swagger in, 
       four of them headed by JAMES HEMMINGS as "TYBALT."

                           NOL AS BENVOLIO
                 "By my head, here comes the Capulets."

                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO
                 "By my heel, I care not."

                           JAMES HEMMINGS AS TYBALT
                 "Follow me close, for I will speak to 
                 them. (with bombast to "MERCUTIO") 
                 Gentlemen, good e'en: a word with one 
                 of you."

       NED comes out of character.

                           ALLEYN
                 Are you going to do it like that? And 
                 before the humbled actor can reply NED 
                 continues.

                           ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO)
                 And but one word with one of us? 
                 Couple it with something, make it a 
                 word and a blow.

       But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, 
       ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have 
       arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs, 
       and a bucket (containing pig swill).

                           BURBAGE
                 Where is that thieving hack who can't 
                 keep his pen in his own ink pot!?

       WILL has already leapt up onto the stage.

                           WILL
                 What is this rabble?!

       BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave 
       from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. 
       He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, 
       THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings 
       bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S 
       MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed 
       skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using 
       everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is 
       yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, 
       a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the 
       page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, 
       watches enthralled.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!

       But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't 
       belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his 
       interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is 
       using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one 
       of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH

                           HENSLOWE
                 Not with my props!

       VIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a 
       well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow 
       aimed at WILL

                           VIOLA
                 Will! What--?

                           WILL
                 A literary feud. Quite normal.

       Then he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage 
       taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known 
       as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Stay hid!

       He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are 
       worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, 
       with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the 
       best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for 
       the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED 
       ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon 
       cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying 
       feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head 
       pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs 
       and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and 
       half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover 
       blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just 
       nicely for Will to plummet down it.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.

                           WILL
                 I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. 
                 You were cast ashore in a far country.

       They embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of 
       their own.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.

       The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, 
       continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's 
       ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd 
       props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks 
       up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.

                           HENSLOWE
                 We need that for the balcony scene!

       FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He 
       looks around the realises that some of these faces are 
       unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. 
       FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                     (in despair)
                 My poor Rose!

       He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to 
       him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults 
       them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that 
       this scene is not in them.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (horrified)
                 My investment! LAMBERT!!!

       LAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but 
       wakes to his master's call.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                     (points at the fray)
                 VENGEANCE!

       HENSLOWE attempts to intervene.

                           HENSLOWE
                 I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. 
                 As I explained to you, the theatre 
                 business

                           FENNYMAN
                 Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my 
                 business I would be out of business if 
                 I had your courage, so don't tell me 
                 about business

       And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S 
       MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is 
       making short work of the rest of the opposition, 
       receiving help with the thorny business of identification 
       from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are 
       running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic 
       last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage 
       and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts 
       applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start 
       applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN 
       looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and 
       bravos engulf him. A star!

       INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

       The victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel, 
       FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is 
       already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS. It's a party.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (shouts)
                 A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open 
                 and on the house! Oh what happy hour!
                     (and grabbing a RADDLED 
                      WHORE)
                 Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to 
                 yourself I'll not have you infecting 
                 my investment!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (looking around guardedly. To 
                      WILL)
                 Is this a tavern?

                           WILL
                 It is also a tavern.

       WILL sits her down in THE COMPANY and takes the chair 
       next to her A PRETTY WHORE immediately sits on WILL'S 
       knee and kisses him.

                           PRETTY WHORE
                 I remember you! The poet!

       VIOLA furiously pulls the PRETTY WHORE off WILL'S lap.

                           PRETTY WHORE (CONT'D)
                 One at a time, one at a time!

                           SECOND WHORE
                     (to VIOLA)
                 Oh, he's a pretty one! Tell me your 
                 story while I tickle your fancy!

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill-
                 repute!

                           WILL
                 It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. 
                 Come, there is no harm in a drink.

       Glasses are shoved into their hands. Everyone has a 
       glass. Except RALPH

                           RALPH
                     (declining the glass)
                 Never when I'm working!

       The PRETTY WHORE has turned her attention to SAM. SAM 
       looks uncomfortable

                           PRETTY WHORE
                 Never tried it? Never?
                     (groping him)
                 I think you are ready, Sam!

       FENNYMAN shouts a toast.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (raising his glass)
                 You are welcome to my best house! 
                 Here's to the Admiral's Men!

       Everybody drinks. VIOLA drinks too. She decides too. She 
       decides to enjoy it. She bangs down her glass.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (shouts)
                 The Admiral's Men!

       WILL toasts with her. He sees that she feels one of THE 
       COMPANY.

       EXT. STREET. NIGHT.

       A figure is running desperately through the streets. He 
       comes into the square and runs towards the Rose.

       EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

       Half THE COMPANY are singing. NOL and a WHORE are 
       tumbling down the stairs together. He is without his 
       trousers. An awful lot of drink has gone down.

                           SAM
                     (to the PRETTIEST WHORE)
                 Iquite liked it.

       VIOLA, bright eyed, is banging her glass on the table in 
       time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a 
       barbershop quartet of actors.

       FENNYMAN reels into VIOLA.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Master Kent! You have not dipped your 
                 wick?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                     (baffled)
                 My wick?

                           WILL
                     (saving her)
                 Mr. Fennyman, because you love the 
                 theatre you must have a part in my 
                 play. I am writing an Apothecary, a 
                 small but vital role.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (embracing WILL)
                 By heaven, I thank you! I will be your 
                 Apothecary!

       In his general enthusiasm, he embraces the next man, who 
       is RALPH, stone cold sober.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 I am to be in your play.

                           WHORE
                     (to RALPH)
                 And what is this play about?

                           RALPH
                 Well, there's this Nurse

       FENNYMAN, beside himself, shouts for silence, announcing

                           FENNYMAN
                 Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part 
                 of the Apothecary!

                           HENSLOWE
                 The Apothecary? Will, what is the 
                 story? Where is the shipwreck? How 
                 does the comedy end?

                           WILL
                 By God, I wish I knew.

                           HENSLOWE
                 By God, Will, if you do not, who does? 
                 Let us have pirates, clowns, and a 
                 happy ending, or we will send you back 
                 to Stratford to your wife!

       That goes down every well with the entire COMPANYexcept 
       for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then 
       makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him 
       and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears. 
       VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street. 
       WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the 
       shoulders by PETERwho, we now see, is in a highly 
       emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER 
       has the strength of the news he brings.

                           PETER
                     (shouts)
                 Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

       He brings the room to silence.

                           PETER (CONT'D)
                 A black day for us all! There is news 
                 come up river from Deptford. Marlowe 
                 is dead.

       There are general gasps and cries for information.

                           PETER (CONT'D)
                 Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern 
                 at Deptford!

       No one is more affected than WILL. This second blow is 
       worse than the first. He stands horror-stricken.

                           WILL
                 Ohwhat have I done?

                           ALLEYN
                     (standing up)
                 He was the first man among us. A great 
                 light has gone out.

       EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

       WILL comes staggering out into the street.

                           WILL
                 It was I who killed him! God forgive 
                 me, God forgive me!

       He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water 
       and garbage. He gets up and staggers on.

       EXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT.

       A church tower looms up in the night sky.

       INT. CHURCH. NIGHT.

       This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for 
       the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, 
       praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private 
       purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by 
       effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is 
       wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

       A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. 
       VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides 
       sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather 
       like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive 
       animal. 

       Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a 
       happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. 
       Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA 
       and greets her merrily.

                           WESSEX
                 You look sad, my lady! Let me take you 
                 riding.

                           VIOLA
                 It is not my riding day, my lord.

                           WESSEX
                 Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

                           VIOLA
                 I am going to church.

                           WESSEX
                     (recomposing his features to 
                      solemnity)
                 I understand of course. It is to be 
                 expected.

                           VIOLA
                 It is to be expected on a Sunday.

                           WESSEX
                 And on a day of mourning. I never met 
                 the fellow but once at your house.

                           VIOLA
                     (cannot take this in)
                 Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?

                           WESSEX
                 Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would 
                 be me to tell you. A great loss to 
                 playwriting, and to dancing.

       VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her.

                           VIOLA
                     (faintly)
                 He is dead?

                           WESSEX
                     (cheerfully solemn)
                 Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, 
                 then, we'll say a prayer for his soul

       VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in 
       distress.

                           NURSE
                 My ladymy ladynow is the time to 
                 show your breeding.

       INT. CHURCH. DAY.

       The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. 
       VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat 
       and sits down next to her. 

       As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is 
       sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. 
       He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns 
       him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.

       ANGLE on WILL. 

       WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great 
       shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of 
       times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has 
       banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he 
       stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX. 

       WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering 
       accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to 
       mumble.

                           WESSEX
                 Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for 
                 the love of Christ!

       Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at 
       first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment 
       as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally 
       running in terror.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                     (screaming)
                 Spare me!

       The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA 
       to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is 
       leaving.

       EXT. CHURCH. DAY.

       Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the 
       church. She calls his name.

                           VIOLA
                 Will!

       He does not answer. She runs after him.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!

       She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment 
       then WILL pulls back.

                           WILL
                 It is worse. I have killed a man.

       EXT. MEADOW. DAY.

       VIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still 
       sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among 
       the buttercups and looks down at him. 
       VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She 
       has not yet revealed her feelings.

                           WILL
                 Marlowe's touch was in my Titus 
                 Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house 
                 built on his foundations.

                           VIOLA
                 You never spoke so well of him.

                           WILL
                 He was not dead before. I would 
                 exchange all my plays to come for all 
                 of his that will never come.

                           VIOLA
                 You lie.

       WILL turns to look at her.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 You lie in your meadow as you lied in 
                 my bed.

                           WILL
                 My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, 
                 and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir 
                 Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife 
                 come from Stratford to tell you that. 
                 And yet you let me come to your bed.

                           VIOLA
                 Calf love. I loved the writer, and 
                 gave up the prize for a sonnet.

                           WILL
                 I was the more deceived.

                           VOILA
                 Yes--you were deceived. For I never 
                 loved you till now.

                           WILL
                 Now?

                           VIOLA
                     (declaring herself)
                 I love you, Will, beyond poetry.

                           WILL
                 Oh, my love
                     (he kisses her)
                 You ran from me before.

                           VIOLA
                 You were not dead before. When I 
                 thought you dead, I did not care about 
                 all the plays that will never come, 
                 only that I would never see your face. 
                 I saw our end, and it will come.

                           WILL
                 You cannot marry Wessex!

                           VIOLA
                 If not Wessex the Queen will know the 
                 cause and there will be no more Will 
                 Shakespeare.

       They kiss again, passionately.

                           WILL
                 Nono.

                           VIOLA
                     (through his kisses)
                 But I will go to Wessex as a widow 
                 from these vows, as solemn as they are 
                 unsanctified.

       And as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut 
       to:

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

                           WILL
                     (he is mid speech)
                 For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, 
                 the one who killed Romeo's friend 
                 Mercutio, Romeo is banished

       He is on the stage of the Rose. The entire COMPANY is 
       assembled, HENSLOWE and FENNYMAN included, holding pages 
       of manuscript, which they are sharing together, examining 
       the separated pages, passing pages to each other, etc. 
       WILL'S mood is intense and focused.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 but the Friar who married Romeo and 
                 Juliet

                           ACTOR (EDWARD)
                 Is that me. Will?

                           WILL
                 You, Edward. The Friar who married 
                 them gives Juliet a potion to drink. 
                 It is a secret potion. It makes her 
                 seeming dead. She is placed in the 
                 tomb of the Capulets. She will awake 
                 to life and love when Romeo comes to 
                 her side again.

       THE COMPANY murmurs approval.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 I have not said all. By malign fate, 
                 the message goes astray which would 
                 tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He 
                 hears only that Juliet is dead. And 
                 thus he goes to the Apothecary.

                           FENNYMAN
                 That's me.

                           WILL
                 And buys a deadly poison. He enters 
                 the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who 
                 lies there cold as death. He drinks 
                 the poison. He dies by her side. And 
                 then she wakes and sees him dead.

       HENSLOWE is fascinated and appalled.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 And so Juliet takes his dagger and 
                 kills herself.

       PAUSE.

       WILL is staring at VIOLA

                           HENSLOWE
                 Well, that will have them rolling in 
                 the aisles.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Sad and wonderful! I have a blue 
                 velvet cap which will do well, I have 
                 seen apothecary with a cap just so.

                           ALLEYN
                     (to WILL)
                 Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene 
                 missing between marriage and death.

       WILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the 
       others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head. 
       WILL looks at NED.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

       WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present 
       for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on 
       sheets folded to octavo size.

                           WILL
                 The play. All written out for you. I 
                 had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he 
                 has a good fist for lettering.

       She wants to accept the present with joy, but something 
       in his mood restrains her.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 There's a new scene

       He turns the pages and shows her.

                           VIOLA
                 Will you read it for me?

                           WILL
                     (he knows it)
                 "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near 
                 day> It was the nightingale and not 
                 the lark That pierced the fearful 
                 hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings 
                 on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, 
                 love, it was the nightingale."

                           VIOLA
                     (reading)
                 "It was the lark, the herald of the 
                 morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what 
                 envious streaks Do lace the severing 
                 clouds in yonder east. Night's candles 
                 are burnt out, and jocund day Stands 
                 tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I 
                 must be gone and live, or stay and 
                 die."

       The words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their 
       way of saying the farewells they cannot utter.

                           WILL
                 "Yon light is not daylight, I know it, 
                 I. It is some meteor that the sun 
                 exhales To be to thee this night a 
                 torchbearer"

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as 
       "THOMAS." Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a 
       deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc., 
       they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether 
       it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it 
       is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming 
       away, their words interrupted by kisses.

                           WILL
                 "thou need'st not to be gone."

                           VIOLA
                 "I have more care to stay than will to 
                 go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet 
                 wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's 
                 talk. It is not day."

       By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away 
       and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness. 

       And into this heaving composition comes a little white 
       mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in 
       the planking behind VIOLA'S head. 

       An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not 
       need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S. 

       WEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns, 
       thinking it out.

       EXT. ALLEWAY. DAY.

       TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand.

                           TILNEY
                 You will go far, I fear.

                           TILNEY (CONT'D)
                 I hope we work together again. Tilney 
                 walks away.

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

       A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is 
       muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is 
       FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, 
       for which he has a special voice.

                           FENNYMAN
                 "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's 
                 law Is death to any he that utters 
                 them." Then him. Then me.

       "Put this in any liquid thing you will And"--something

       He has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 "Such mortal drugs I have" What is 
                 it? What is it?

       He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not 
       notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance 
       dismounts and walks inside.

       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       Onstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in. 
       Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actorsand JOHN 
       WEBSTERwho sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him.

                           WEBSTER
                 My lord!

       WESSEX knocks him aside and continues.

                           WESSEX
                     (shouts)
                 Shakespeare!

       Everything stops.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 You upstart inky pup! Now I will show 
                 you your place, which is in hell!

                           WILL
                 You are on my ground.

                           WESSEX
                     (drawing his sword)
                 By God, I'll fight the lot of you

       WILL draws his sword.

                           WILL
                 I am more than enough.

       VIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the 
       fight has started. 

       WESSEX slashes at WILL. WILL knows how to fight. He 
       parries and thrusts. WESSEX is surprised. The fight goes 
       fast and furious around the stage, until WILL thrusts 
       accurately at WESSEX'S chestand would have killed him 
       but for the button on his sword-point. 

       WESSEX grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of 
       the Hamlet duel; WESSEX'S unbuttoned sword falls to the 
       ground, WILL puts his foot on it, tosses WESSEX his own 
       safe sword, picks up Wessex's sword and continues the 
       fight until he has WESSEX at his mercy. 

       WILL has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody 
       staring at him. Now the look in his eyes is merciless.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 Absent friends!
                     (to the assembly)
                 This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

       NED ALLEYN comes forward looking worried and dubious.

                           ALLEYN
                 Will

                           WESSEX
                 I rejoiced at his death because I 
                 thought it was yours. That is all I 
                 know of Marlowe.

                           ALLEYN
                 It's true, Will--it was a tavern 
                 brawlMarlowe attacked, and got his 
                 own knife in the eye. A quarrel about 
                 the bill

                           HENSLOWE
                 The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!

                           ALLEYN
                 Not the billing, the bill!

       WILL steps back, and sinks to his knees. His relief could 
       not be greater.

                           WILL
                     (to the heavens)
                 Oh God, I am free of it!

       WESSEX gets to his feet. TILNEY enters the auditorium 
       from the public entrance.

                           WESSEX
                 Close it!

                           TILNEY
                 My Lord Wessex!

                           WESSEX
                     (foaming)
                 Close it! Take it down stone by stone! 
                 I want it ploughed into the ground, 
                 and sown with quick lime!

       WESSEX storms out past the bewildered TILNEY.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Mr. Tilney, what is this?

                           TILNEY
                 Sedition and indecency!

                           HENSLOWE
                 What?!

                           WEBSTER
                 Master of the Revels, sir, over here, 
                 sir.

                           TILNEY
                     (to WEBSTER)
                 Where, boy?

                           WEBSTER
                     (points)
                 I saw her bubbies!

                           TILNEY
                     (shocked and gratified)
                 A woman on the stage? A woman?

                           WEBSTER
                 I swear it!

       THE COMPANY of actors are dumbstruck. None more than 
       VIOLA.

                           TILNEY
                 So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is 
                 closed! On the authority of the powers 
                 invested in my by the court--I close 
                 this theatre!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Why so?

                           TILNEY
                     (triumphantly)
                 For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For 
                 displaying a female on the public 
                 stage!

       TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stageand seizes 
       SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY 
       pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell 
       of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers. 

       TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER 
       rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly 
       throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a 
       shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via 
       VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which 
       time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her 
       hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender. 
       WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible 
       despair and apology.

                           WEBSTER
                     (pointing at SAM)
                 Not him.
                     (pointing at VIOLA)
                 her.

                           HENSLOWE
                 He's a woman!

       By now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre, or so 
       it seems.

                           TILNEY
                 That's who I meant! This theatre is 
                 closed! Notice will be posted!

       SAM has picked himself up, and his drawers.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (to NED)
                 Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!

                           VIOLA
                     (hoping to protect WILL)
                 Nobody knew!

                           WEBSTER
                     (pointing at WILL)
                 He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!

       Everybody looks at WILL, who stares at VIOLA, helpless.

                           TILNEY
                 Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!

       TILNEY turns on his heel and leaves in triumph. THE 
       COMPANY is still polaxed.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (in despair)
                 It is over.

                           VIOLA
                 I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted 
                 to be an actor.
                     (she turns to WILL)
                 I am sorry, Will.

       WILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks 
       away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her 
       go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH

                           WABASH
                 Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w-
                 wonderful.

                           VIOLA
                 Thank you.

       As she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off 
       towards herbut his progress is halted by a sock to the 
       jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust. 
       FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper, 
       mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the 
       groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole 
       COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or 
       worse. FENNYMAN looks around.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Everything all right?

       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. EVENING.

       The closure notice is nailed to the door.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

       VIOLA, in her nightdress, is reading by candlelight. She 
       is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Julietand 
       rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the 
       NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts 
       the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and 
       raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing. 

       She looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be 
       said.

       INT. TAVERN. DAY.

       They are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and 
       HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk. 
       FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat 
       selfishly.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (muttering)
                 I would have been goodI would have 
                 been great.

       He hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood.

                           RALPH
                 So would I. We both would.

       RALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not 
       working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over, 
       rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE 
       enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the 
       CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes 
       and bandages round their heads.

                           FENNYMAN
                     (shouts)
                 Lambert!

       LAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his 
       tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and 
       tables out of his way.

                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
                 Kill him!

       LAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes 
       down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a 
       battle-axe. 

       But BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash. 
       BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame, 
       LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand. 
       BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is 
       half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces 
       BURBAGE.

                           ALLEYN
                 Well, Burbage--you never did know when 
                 your scene was over.

                           BURBAGE
                 That can wait. The Master of the 
                 Revels despises us for vagrants, 
                 tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But 
                 my father, James Burbage, had the 
                 first licence to make a company of 
                 players from Her Majesty, and he drew 
                 from poets the literature of the age. 
                 Their fame will be our fame. So let 
                 them all know, we are men of parts. We 
                 are a brotherhood, and we will be a 
                 profession. Will Shakespeare has a 
                 play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is 
                 yours.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a 
       paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble 
       pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of 
       wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen 
       flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot 
       runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at 
       the poster. It says

                           BY PERMISSION OF
                 MR. BURBAGE
                 A
                 HUGH FENNYMAN PRODUCTION
                 OF
                 MR. HENSLOWE'S PRESENTATION
                 OF
                 THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE
                 OF
                 THE EXCELLENT AND LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY
                 OF
                 ROMEO AND JULIET
                 with Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary

       WILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He 
       walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him:

                           HENSLOWE
                 Will!

       WILL does not turn to look at him.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                 We'll be needing a Romeo

       WILL carries on walking.

       EXT. STREETS. DAY.

       WILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the 
       river.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.

       The NURSE is helping VIOLA to dress--in a wedding dress. 
       The NURSE is in tears. VIOLA submits to the task 
       impassively.

       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

       WILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. DAY.

       WESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his 
       negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS 
       weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money 
       chest, too.

                           WESSEX
                 My ship is moored at Bankside, bound 
                 for Virginia on the afternoon 
                 tide--please do not weep, Lady De 
                 Lesseps, you are gaining a colony.

                           DE LESSEPS
                 And you are gaining five thousand 
                 pounds, my lordby these drafts in my 
                 hand.

                           WESSEX
                 Would you oblige me with fifty or so 
                 in gold?--just to settle my accounts at 
                 the dockside?

       DE LESSEPS sighs and unlocks his money chest. WESSEX 
       places his empty purse on the desk.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 Ah!--Look, she comes!

       VIOLA has appeared at the top of the stairs with the 
       NURSE.

                           VIOLA
                 Good morning, my lord. I see you are 
                 open for business so let's to church.

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he 
       crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down 
       on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of 
       the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and 
       his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the 
       carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal

       EXT. CHURCH DOOR. DAY.

       The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as 
       WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S 
       veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just 
       see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage 
       is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction. 

       Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer 
       from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at 
       it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to 
       VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes 
       it to the NURSE. 

       WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage 
       awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door 
       for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to 
       follow her.

                           NURSE
                 My lord!

       The NURSE grasps him in a moving embrace, to WESSEX'S 
       discomfort.

                           NURSE (CONT'D)
                 Be good to her, my lord!

                           WESSEX
                 I will.

       He tries to disengage. She won't have it.

                           NURSE
                 God bless you!

                           WESSEX
                 Thank you. Let go, there's a good 
                 nurse.

       After a couple of further attempts, WESSEX extricates 
       himself.

                           WESSEX (CONT'D)
                 The tide will not wait. Farewell!

       WESSEX pulls aside the curtain and gets in.

       INT. CARRIAGE. DAY.

       It takes a moment for WESSEX to realise he is alone in 
       there. He looks around but VIOLA has fled.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among 
       them is the Puritan MAKEPEACE, vainly exhorting the 
       crowds to run away from sin

                           MAKEPEACE
                 Licentiousness is made a show, vice is 
                 made a show, vanity and pride likewise 
                 made a show! This is the very business 
                 of show

       But MAKEPEACE is being carried inexorably through the 
       main doors of the theatre.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       The ADMIRAL'S MEN are all in costume, and are in a buzz 
       of nervous excitement. ALLEYN, dressed for "MERCUTIO," is 
       giving last minute instructions to PETER. JAMES and JOHN 
       HEMMINGS are arguing about the timing of their entrance. 
       FENNYMAN in his apothecary's cap is agonising over his 
       lines. WABASH is stuttering over his. Alone in his 
       dejection in the midst of all this, is WILL, dressed for

                           "ROMEO."
                 FENNYMAN approaches him, apothecary's 
                 cap in hand.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Is this all right?

       WILL nods, miserable. SAM has found a private corner. He 
       is gargling into a basin. He looks worried and furtive.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The audience is gathering.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       Word has got around. Even rich people are coming. They 
       arrive by carriage and by palanquin. 
       Some of them are cloaked and hooded, slumming incognito. 
       A cannon booms from the Curtain. The flag of the 
       ADMIRAL'S MEN flutters above.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. ENTRANCE. DAY.

       LAMBERT and FREES are taking the entrance money.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The auditorium is now packed. Among them, sheepish, is 
       MAKEPEACE.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       Everything is ready. NED signals the musicians. Trumpets 
       and drums sound. The house falls silent.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

       WABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have 
       never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering 
       lines and stuttering them.

                           WABASH
                     (mutter)
                 T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike 
                 in d-d-d-dignity.

       WILL listens to him in agony. He finds HENSLOWE next to 
       him.

                           WILL
                     (to HENSLOWE)
                 We are lost.

                           HENSLOWE
                 No, it will turn out well.

                           WILL
                 How will it?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I don't know, it's a mystery.

       And off we go. HENSLOWE claps WABASH on the shoulder and 
       sends him through the curtain.

       ANGLE on WABASH

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       The audience waits expectantly. WABASH gathers himself.

                           WABASH AS THE CHORUS
                 T-t-t-t-two

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       WILL shuts his eyes and prays.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       WABASH launches himself into a perfect audacious delivery 
       like a star.

                           WABASH AS THE CHORUS
                 "Household both alike in dignity (in 
                 fair Verona where we lay our scene) 
                 From ancient grudge break to new 
                 mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil 
                 hands unclean. From forth the fatal 
                 loins of these two foes A pair of star-
                 cross'd lovers take their life, Whose 
                 misadventured piteous overthrows Doth 
                 with their death bury their parents' 
                 strife"

       EXT. STREET. DAY.

       VIOLA and the NURSE, hurrying toward the Curtain.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       HEMMINGS BROTHERS are ready to go on as "SAMPSON" and 
       "GROCERY," Act I Scene I. They shake hands. Beyond the 
       curtain, the audience applauds the Prologue as WABASH 
       comes through the curtain backstage.

                           WILL
                     (to WABASH)
                 Wonderful!

                           WABASH
                 W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good?

       The HEMMINGS BROTHERS enter the arena and the play 
       begins.

       POV: from THE WINGS:

                           JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON
                 "Gregory, on my word we'll not carry 
                 coals."

                           JAMES HEMMINGS AS GREGORY
                 "No, for then we should be colliers." 
                 WILL looks as if he would rather be 
                 dead. SAM GOSSE approaches WILL, 
                 nervously.

                           SAM
                     (nervously--in a deep bass 
                      guttural hoarse voice)
                 Master Shakespeare

                           WILL
                     (absently)
                 Luck be with you, Sam.
                     (as the awful truth gets 
                      through to him)
                 Sam?

                           SAM
                     (in the same voice)
                 It is not my fault, Master 
                 Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.

                           WILL
                 Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.

                           SAM
                     (the effect is horrible)
                 "Parting is such sweet sorrow"

       HENSLOWE has been overhearing.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Another little problem.

                           WILL
                 What do we do now?

                           HENSLOWE
                 The show must  you know

                           WILL
                 Go on.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Juliet does not come on for twenty 
                 pages. It will be all right.

                           WILL
                 How will it?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I don't know. It's a mystery.

       And he makes his way towards the front of the house.

       EXT. STREET. DAY.

       A furious WESSEX is hurrying along the road to the 
       theatre.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

       VIOLA and the NURSE are arriving, and looking for a seat 
       in the gallery. BURBAGE and his MEN are standing at the 
       back, behind the people seated in the gallery. The first 
       scene of the play is continuing

                           ARMITAGE AS ABRAM
                 "Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"

                           JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON
                 "I do bite my thumb, sir."

       BURBAGE finds HENSLOWE plucking agitatedly at his sleeve.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Can we talk?

       They are standing behind the back row of the gallery 
       seats. The spectator in front of them is the NURSE. She 
       turns round and shushes HENSLOWE up.

                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
                     (whispering to BURBAGE)
                 We have no Juliet!

                           BURBAGE
                     (forgetting to whisper)
                 No Juliet?!

                           VIOLA
                     (turning)
                 No Juliet?!

                           HENSLOWE
                 it will be all right, madam.

                           VIOLA
                 What happened to Sam?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Who are you?

                           VIOLA
                 Thomas Kent!

       Their whispers are causing black looks and hushing noises 
       from the neighbours. HENSLOWE pulls VIOLA from her seat, 
       luckily an aisle seat.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Do you know it?

                           VIOLA
                     (showing the manuscript)
                 Every word.

       HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other. CUT TO:

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           PHILIP AS LADY CAPULET
                 "Nurse, where is my daughter? Call her 
                 forth to me."

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Now by my maidenhead at twelve year 
                 old, I bade her come. What, lamb. What 
                 ladybird."

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS/STAGE. DAY.

       SAM who gathers himself, to make his entrance, quietly 
       and horribly practising "How now, who calls?"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                     (on stage)
                 "God forbid. Where's this girl?

       The author and star, WILL SHAKESPEARE, has his back to 
       the stage, his hands over his ears. He is cowering in 
       dread anticipation.

                           RALPH AS NURSE (CONT'D)
                 "What, Juliet!"

       As SAM is about to enter HENSLOWE'S hand yanks him by the 
       collar, and VIOLA overtakes him and steps on stage. Enter 
       "JULIET." VIOLA is not wearing the been hidden from us by 
       her cloak.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "How now, who calls?"

                           RALPH AS NURSE
                 "Your mother."

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "Madam. I am here, what is your will?

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       There is a collective gasp. Nobody has ever seen a BOY 
       PLAYER like this.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

       WILL takes his hands from his ears, and turns round in 
       amazement at the sound of VIOLA'S voice.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

       WESSEX has just arrived in the auditorium and jumps as if 
       he has been shot. He seems about to intervene, but 
       looking around at the rapt faces he realises he cannot.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

       HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other.

                           BURBAGE
                 We will all be put in the clink.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (shrugs)
                 See you in jail.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       FENNYMAN, oblivious to the drama, is practising his lines 
       in a fever of nervousness.

                           FENNYMAN
                 "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's 
                 Law Is death to any he that utters 
                 them." Then him. Then me.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       Swordplay. An amazing performance that holds the audience 
       spellbound. "TYBALT" kills "MERCUTIO."

                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO
                     (to ROMEO)
                 "I am hurt.

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 Courage man. The hurt cannot be much.

                           ALLEYN A MERCUTIO
                 Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find 
                 me a grave man."

       A roll of thunder. Over the heads of the audience, far 
       above the thatched roof of the theatre, clouds are 
       gathering in the sky. On stage "MERCUTIO" is in 'ROMEO'S" 
       arms, but the tone of the playing is unlike anything we 
       have seen before: without bombast, intense and real. And 
       the audience is quiet and attentive.

                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO (CONT'D)
                 "--Why the devil came you between us? 
                 I was hurt under your arms."

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       In the semirural view towards the City of London, there 
       can be discerned a gaggle of approaching MEN and three is 
       something orderly about them. As they come closer, we see 
       that they are a company of PIKE MEN, marching toward the 
       theatre, led by the Master of the Revels, TILNEY. Thunder 
       rolls.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       Figures are running across the stage, in the panic that 
       follows "TYBALT" death.

                           ACTOR AS BENVOLIO
                 "Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens 
                 are up and Tybalt slain. Stand not 
                 amazed. The prince will doom thee 
                 death If thou art taken. Hence, be 
                 gone away!"

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "I am fortune's fool!"

                           ACTOR AS BENVOLIO
                 "Why dost thou stay!"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       WILL has just 'killed' "TYBALT." He is still breathless 
       from fighting. he stands face to face with VIOLA.

                           WILL
                 I am fortune's fool.

       They stare at each other, transfixed.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 You are married?

       PAUSE. She cannot answer.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 If you be married, my gave is like to 
                 be my wedding bed. The implication of 
                 her silence fills the air. WILL does 
                 not move.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       We cannot tell whether this is the play or their life. 
       The audience, and the rest of the world, might as well 
       not exist. WILL turn from her and begins to descend from 
       the 'balcony.'

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "Art thou gone so?

       WILL stops.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET (CONT'D)
                 Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must 
                 hear from thee every day in the hour, 
                 For in a minute there are many days. 
                 O, by this count I shall be much in 
                 years Ere I again behold my Romeo"

       WILL as "ROMEO" seems unable to speak. Then he says:

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Farewell"

       All other sounds drain away, and time seems to stop.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "O think'st thou we shall ever meet 
                 again? Methinks I see thee, now thou 
                 art so low, As one dead in the bottom 
                 of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails, 
                 or thou lookest pale."

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Trust me, love, in my eyes so do you. 
                 Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu. 
                 Adieu"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       Now the FRIAR is giving "JULIET' his potion.

                           EDWARD AS FRIAR
                 "No warmth, no breath shall testify 
                 thou livest And in this borrow'd 
                 likeness of shrunk death Thou shall 
                 continue two and forty hours And then 
                 awake as from a pleasant sleep"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       It's FENNYMAN'S moment. The "APOTHECARY" and "ROMEO."

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Come hither, man. I see that thou art 
                 poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let 
                 me have A dram of poison--"

                           FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY
                 "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's 
                 law is death to any he that utters 
                 them!"

       FENNYMAN has cut in several lines early, but his 
       conviction is astonishing.

                           FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY
                 "My poverty but not my will consents."

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "I pay thy poverty and not thy will."

       EXT. STREET. NEAR THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       TILNEY, on the march. His hand grips a copy of the 
       Curtain flyer.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       "JULIET" lies "dead." She lies on top of her tomb, "lying 
       in stage," her best dress, her hair done, her hands in 
       prayer at her breast, her eyes closed. "ROMEO" has found 
       her like this.

                           WILL AS ROMEO
                 "Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your 
                 last embrace! and lips, Oh you The 
                 doors of breath, seal with a righteous 
                 kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing 
                 death! Come, bitter conduct; come, 
                 unsavory guide! Thou desparate pilot, 
                 now at once run on The dashing rocks 
                 thy seasick weary bark!"

       As WILL embraces her, VIOLA'S eyes flicker open (shielded 
       by WILL from the audience) and the lovers look at each 
       other for a moment as WILL and VIOLA rather than as 
       "ROMEO" and "JULIET." Their eyes are wet with tears.

                 "Where is my lord?

       I do remember well where I should be, And there I am. 
       Where is my Romeo?"

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

                           NURSE
                     (involuntarily)
                 Dead!

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "What here? A cup clos'd in my true 
                 love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been 
                 his timeless end."

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

       "JULIET" takes "ROMEO'S" dagger.

                           VIOLA AS JULIET
                 "O happy dagger

       This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die."

       She stabs herself and dies. The "inner curtain" closes 
       over the tomb.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       HIGH ANGLE on audience and stage. "THE PRINCE" played by 
       WABASH is having the last word.

                           THE PRINCE
                 "For never was a story of more woe 
                 Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

       The end. There is complete silence. The ACTORS are 
       worried. But then the audience goes mad with applause.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE INNER CURTAIN/STAGE. DAY.

       The inner curtain opens, but WILL and VIOLA, are in a 
       play of their ownembracing and kissing passionately, 
       making their own farewell. HENSLOWE is too stunned and 
       moved to react at first. Then he looks at the audience 
       and the penny drops. It's a hit.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

       The audience roars. WILL, VIOLA, and THE COMPANY come 
       forward to meet the applause. TILNEY and his MEN burst 
       in. TILNEY jumps up onto the stage, where the ADMIRAL'S 
       MEN are taking their bows. TILNEY'S "COPS" ring the 
       stage, facing inwards.

                           TILNEY
                     (shouts triumphantly)
                 I arrest you in the name of Queen 
                 Elizabeth!

       The AUDIENCE goes quiet. BURBAGE jumps out of the 
       audience onto the stage.

                           BURBAGE
                 Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

                           TILNEY
                 Everybody! The Admiral's Men, The 
                 Chamberlain's Men and everyone of you 
                 ne'er-do-wells who stands in contempt 
                 of the authority invested in me by her 
                 Majesty.

                           BURBAGE
                 Contempt? You closed the Rose--I have 
                 not opened it.

       TILNEY is at a loss but only for a moment.

                           TILNEY
                     (he points a "j'accuse" 
                      finger at VIOLA)
                 That woman is a woman!

       The entire audience and the actors, recoil and gasp. The 
       NURSE crosses herself.

                           ALLEYN
                 What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?!

       He points at VIOLA, brazening it out without much chance.

                           TILNEY
                 I'll see you all in the clink! In the 
                 same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth

       And an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts 
       him.

                           VOICE
                 Mr. Tilney!

       It is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood 
       and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft 
       of sunlight hits her.

                           QUEEN
                 Have a care with my name, you will 
                 wear it out.

       There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and 
       actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN 
       ELIZABETH takes the limelight.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 The Queen of England does not attend 
                 exhibitions of public lewdness so 
                 something is out of joint. Come here, 
                 Master Kent. Let me look at you.

       VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she 
       catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests 
       the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 Yes, the illusion is remarkable and 
                 your error, Mr. Tilney, easily 
                 forgiven, but I know something of a 
                 woman in a man's profession, yes, by 
                 God, I do know about that. That is 
                 enough from you, Maser Kent. If only 
                 Lord Wessex were here.

                           VOICE
                 He is, Ma'am.

       The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a 
       figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look 
       inconspicuous.

                           WESSEX
                     (weakly)
                 Your Majesty

                           QUEEN
                 There was a wager, I rememberas to 
                 whether a play can show the very truth 
                 and nature of love. I think you lost 
                 it today.
                     (turning to WEBSTER)
                 You are an eager boy. Did you like the 
                 play?

                           WEBSTER
                 I liked it when she stabbed herself, 
                 your Majesty.

       The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye.

                           QUEEN
                 Master Shakespeare. Next time to you 
                 come to Greenwich, Come as yourself 
                 and we will speak some more. WILL bows 
                 deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The 
                 waves part for her.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. MAIN ENTRANCE. DAY.

       The QUEEN is bowed out through the doors.

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her 
       carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase 
       as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the 
       following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking 
       place, including some of the actors crowding to see her 
       off. WESSEX bows out of breath.

                           WESSEX
                 Your Majesty!

                           QUEEN
                 Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so 
                 soon?

                           WESSEX
                 Indeed I am a bride short. How is this 
                 to end?

       VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the 
       other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.

                           QUEEN
                 As stories must when love's 
                 denied--with tears and a journey. Those 
                 whom God has joined in marriage, not 
                 even I can put asunder.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (she turns to VIOLA)
                 Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost 
                 his wife in the play- house--go make 
                 your farewell and send her out. It's 
                 time to settle accounts.
                     (to WESSEX)
                 How much was the wager?

                           WESSEX
                 Fifty shillings.
                     (the QUEEN gives him a look)
                 Pounds.

                           QUEEN
                 Give it to Master Kent. He will see it 
                 rightfully home. WESSEX gives his 
                 purse to VIOLA.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                     (to VIOLA)
                 And tell Shakespeare something more 
                 cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.

       The QUEEN proceeds towards her carriage. There is an 
       enormous puddle between her and her carriage. The QUEEN 
       hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the 
       puddle as cloaks descend upon it.

                           QUEEN (CONT'D)
                 Too late, too late.

       She splashes her way into her carriage, which departs.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

                           WILL
                     (heartbroken, testing her 
                      name)
                 My Lady Wessex?

       VIOLA nods, heartbroken too. For a long moment they 
       cannot say anything to each other. The she holds up 
       Wessex's purse.

                           VIOLA
                 A hired player no longer. Fifty 
                 pounds, Will, for the poet of true 
                 love.

                           WILL
                 I am done with theatre. The playhouse 
                 is for dreamers. Look where the dream 
                 has brought us.

                           VIOLA
                 It was we ourselves did that. And for 
                 my life to come I would not have it 
                 otherwise.

                           WILL
                 I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.

                           VIOLA
                 If my hurt is to be that you will 
                 write no more, then I shall be the 
                 sorrier.

       WILL looks at her.

                           VIOLA (CONT'D)
                 The Queen commands a comedy, Will for 
                 Twelfth Night.

                           WILL
                     (harshly)
                 A comedy! What will my hero be but the 
                 saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick 
                 with love?

                           VIOLA
                 An excellent beginning
                     (a beat)
                 Let him bea duke. And your heroine?

                           WILL
                     (bitterly)
                 Sold in marriage and half way to 
                 America.

                           VIOLA
                     (adjusting)
                 At sea, then--a voyage to a new 
                 world?she lands upon a vast and empty 
                 shore. She is brought to the 
                 dukeOrsino.

                           WILL
                     (despite himself)
                 Orsinogood name

                           VIOLA
                 But fearful of her virtue, she comes 
                 to him dressed as a boy

                           WILL
                     (Catching it)
                 and thus unable to declare her love

       Pause. They look at each other. Suddenly the conversation 
       seems to be about them.

                           VIOLA
                 But all ends well.

                           WILL
                 How does it?

                           VIOLA
                 I don't know. It's a mystery

       WILL half smiles. Then he's serious. They look deeply at 
       each otherand rush into each other's arm.

                           WILL (CONT'D)
                 You will never age for me, nor fade, 
                 nor die.

                           VIOLA
                 Nor you for me.

                           WILL
                 Good bye, my love, a thousand times 
                 good bye.

                           VIOLA
                 Write me well.

       She kisses him with finality. Then turns and runs from 
       him. WILL watches as she goes.

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       A blank page. A hand is writing: TWELFTH NIGHT. We see 
       WILL sitting at his table.

                           WILL (VO)
                 My story starts at seaa perilous 
                 voyage to an unknown landa shipwreck

       EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

       Two figures plunge into the water

                           WILL (VO)
                 the wild waters roar and heavethe 
                 brave vessel is dashed all to pieces, 
                 and all the helpless souls within her 
                 drowned

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       WILL at his table writing

                           WILL (VO)
                 all save one  a lady

       EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

       VIOLA in the water

                           WILL (VO)
                 whose soul is greater than the ocean  
                 and her spirit stronger than the sea's 
                 embrace  not for her watery end, but 
                 a new life beginning on a stranger 
                 shore

       EXT. BEACH. DAY.

       VIOLA is walking up a vast and empty beach .

                           WILL (VO CONTINUED)
                 It will be a love story  for she will 
                 be my heroine for all time

       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

       WILL looks up from the table.

                           WILL (VO CONTINUED)
                 and her name will be  Viola.

       He looks down at the paper, and writes: "Viola" Then: 
       "What country friends is this?"

       EXT. BEACH. DAY.

       DISSOLVE slowly to VIOLA, walking away up the beach 
       towards her brave new world.

          INT. DAY
          
          A blurred image forms on a white screen. A horizontal strip of 
          face, eyes motionless and unblinking.

          Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important

          EXT. DAWN 
          
          A series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets. 
          
          DAVID
          (VOICE-OVER)
          This could have been any city: they're all the same.
          
          A rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow 
          lanes and passageways. Accompanied by soundtrack and credits.
          
          The track ends outside a solid, fashionable Edinburgh tenement.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The 
          door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed 
          with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David 
          Stevens, and Juliet Miller.
          
          A man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron 
          Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and 
          lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag. 
          Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands 
          back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is 
          answered.
          
          CAMERON
          Hello, I've come about the room.
          
          Cameron enters and the door closes.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          David, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly 
          opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair. Alex 
          checks some items on a clipboard before speaking.
          
          ALEX
          What's his name?
          
          DAVID
          I don't know -- Campbell or something?
          
          JULIET
          Cameron.
          
          ALEX
          Cameron?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          (to Juliet)
          Really?
          
          CAMERON
          That's right.
          
          ALEX
          (to Cameron)
          What?
          
          Cameron is not sure what to say.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
          
          CAMERON
          Yes, thanks.
          
          ALEX
          Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
          
          CAMERON
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          And you like it?
          
          CAMERON
          Oh, yes, it's great.
          
          ALEX
          Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, 
          don't you think?
          
          CAMERON
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, 
          all that crap.
          
          CAMERON
          Well, yes.
          
          ALEX
          So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I 
          want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would 
          want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          As Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out 
          against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue.
          
          ALEX
          (VOICE-OVER)
          
          I mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that 
          you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a 
          prospective flatmate. I'm talking here about things like 
          presence, charisma, style and charm, and I don't think we're 
          being unreasonable. Take David here, for instance: a chartered 
          accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard. The point is, I 
          don't think you're even trying.
          
          Cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs. He opens the main 
          door.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          And, Cameron -- I mean this -- good luck!
          
          Cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Do you think he was upset?
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Inside the hall of the flat, David approaches the door toopen it. 
          Freeze-frame.
          
          ALEX
          (VOICE-OVER)
          David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box 
          marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'.
          
          David opens the door to the Woman.
          
          WOMAN
          I've come to see about the room.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Outside the door of the flat a young Goth girl, aged about 
          twenty, rings the doorbell.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Inside the hall of the flat Alex approaches the door to open it. 
          Freeze-frame.
          
          JULIET
          (VOICE-OVER)
          Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it 
          provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous 
          personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't, 
          though there was a time when, well, there was a time when...
          
          Alex opens the door to the Goth.
          
          GOTH
          I've come about the room.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          At the door of the flat a Man aged about thrity-five rings the 
          bell.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Inside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open 
          it. Freeze-frame.
          
          DAVID
          (VOICE-OVER)
          Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling 
          a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I 
          think of Juliet.
          
          Juliet opens the door to the Man.
          
          MAN
          I've come about the room.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed 
          individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e. 
          the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see 
          are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We 
          do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see 
          some facial reaction.
          
          All of David's questions are to the Woman.
          
          All of Alex's questions are to the Goth.
          
          All of Juliet's questions are to the Man.
          
          DAVID
          All right, just a few questions.
          
          ALEX
          I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
          
          JULIET
          Why do you want a room here?
          
          DAVID
          Do you smoke?
          
          ALEX
          When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare 
          hands, do you then summon hellfire?
          
          JULIET
          I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden 
          agenda?
          
          DAVID
          Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
          
          ALEX
          Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
          
          JULIET
          Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either 
          divorced or you're not.
          
          DAVID
          OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd 
          like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit 
          singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
          
          ALEX
          When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of 
          black to wear?
          
          JULIET
          Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not 
          having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
          
          DAVID
          Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, 
          this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad 
          thing?
          
          ALEX
          With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: 
          Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
          
          JULIET
          It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of 
          emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner 
          of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
          
          DAVID
          Did you ever kill a man?
          
          ALEX
          And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are 
          the sunshine of my life'?
          
          JULIET
          OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but 
          D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I 
          were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the 
          alphabet of love.
          
          DAVID
          And what if I told you that I was the antichrist?
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          In a sports centre Juliet sits outside a glass-walled squash 
          court. She is ready to play, but at present is watching Alex and 
          David, who are inside the court.
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          Inside the squash court, Alex is about to serve.
          
          ALEX
          Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for 
          personal domination.
          
          DAVID
          Serve.
          
          ALEX
          I was trying to educate you.
          
          DAVID
          Just serve.
          
          ALEX
          In the same fashion as chess.
          
          DAVID
          What?
          
          ALEX
          Chess. Chess is often used as well.
          
          DAVID
          Will you shut up and play.
          
          ALEX
          You're a bad loser.
          
          DAVID
          I haven't lost yet.
          
          Alex serves.
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          The squash-court door opens and David walks out past Juliet as 
          Alex stands behind, jabbing his finger at him.
          
          ALEX
          Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial, 
          professional, sexual, everything. Next.
          
          Juliet walks in and closes the door.
          
          INT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING
          
          Inside the squash court Alex is about to serve.
          
          ALEX
          Did you know --
          
          JULIET
          Just serve.
          
          Alex serves.
          
          INT. JULIET'S CAR (A MINI). NIGHT
          
          Alex sits in the back, drinking.
          
          Juliet is driving. David sits beside her.
          
          ALEX
          I wasn't trying to win.
          
          There is no response from Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to 
          know: I wasn't trying to win.
          
          DAVID
          Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive 
          competitive urges.
          
          ALEX
          You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
          
          DAVID
          Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
          
          JULIET
          I thought you stopped going.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people 
          should know that.
          
          Alex leans close to Juliet. Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex 
          flies forward, elbows him in the chest.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort 
          of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of 
          thing.
          
          JULIET
          Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
          
          ALEX
          For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
          
          JULIET
          For the flat.
          
          ALEX
          No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to 
          that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked 
          her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We 
          had chemistry.
          
          JULIET
          She hated you --
          
          ALEX
          Well, she had problems --
          
          JULIET
          -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
          
          ALEX
          -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. 
          But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't 
          she?
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Outside the door of the flat Hugo rings the bell and waits. 
          Juliet opens the door. Hugo is in his early thirties, tall, dark 
          and bohemian in appearance.
          
          JULIET
          You must be Hugo.
          
          HUGO
          You must be Juliet.
          
          JULIET
          Would you like to come in?
          
          HUGO
          I'd be delighted.
          
          Hugo walks in and Juliet closes the door quite deliberately 
          behind him.
          
          INT. VACANT ROOM. DAY
          
          Hugo looks around, pleased at what he sees, while Juliet watches 
          him. He sits on the edge of the bed.
          
          HUGO
          It's nice.
          
          JULIET
          Would you like to see the rest?
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          Hugo is seated on the sofa, Juliet sits opposite on an armchair.
          
          JULIET
          What do you do?
          
          HUGO
          Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, 
          and now I'm trying to write a novel.
          
          JULIET
          What's it about?
          
          HUGO
          A priest who dies.
          
          JULIET
          I see.
          
          HUGO
          Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          HUGO
          Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's 
          about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't 
          die. You see, it's better already.
          
          JULIET
          Writing seems easy.
          
          HUGO
          It's a breeze.
          
          The telephone begins to ring out in the hall. Juliet does not 
          move and at first says nothing. Hugo looks at her and towards the 
          door leading to the hall. After several rings, Juliet speaks. 
          
          JULIET
          Do you think you could answer that?
          
          HUGO
          The telephone? 
          It continues to ring.
          
          JULIET
          Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. 
          HUGO
          You're not in.
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          HUGO
          All right.
          
          Hugo stands up. The ringing continues.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Hugo lifts the phone. He turns to face Juliet and looks her in 
          the eye as he lies on her behalf.
          
          HUGO
          Hello. Yes. Who's calling please? Well, I'm sorry, but she's not 
          in right now. I don't know. Would you like to leave a message?
          
          Hugo replaces the receiver.
          
          HUGO
          (CONTINUED)
          It was some guy called Brian.
          
          JULIET
          Did he sound upset?
          
          HUGO
          A little bit. Is that good or bad?
          
          JULIET
          It's an improvement.
          
          The telephone begins to ring again.
          
          HUGO
          Shall I answer it?
          
          JULIET
          No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights 
          this week.
          
          The telephone continues to ring.
          
          HUGO
          Working nights?
          
          JULIET
          I'm a doctor.
          
          HUGO
          And he's a patient of yours?
          
          JULIET
          No. But he needs treatment.
          
          HUGO
          For what?
          
          JULIET
          A certain weakness.
          
          HUGO
          The human condition.
          
          JULIET
          You know about it?
          
          HUGO
          I write about it?
          
          JULIET
          And that's not the same thing?
          
          HUGO
          No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          Juliet, dressed and fatigued, sits at the table sipping a coffee. 
          Alex is also seated at the table, but wearing an old dressing-
          gown and munching at cornflakes while he reads a newspaper and 
          talks at the same time. An array of other papers is spread over 
          the table.
          
          ALEX
          Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I 
          normally find things.
          
          JULIET
          He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
          
          Juliet gets up and leaves the kitchen. The soundof a bath running 
          is heard.
          
          ALEX
          I'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy. All I'm saying is, 
          it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's 
          on about, you know.
          
          Alex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to 
          leave the kitchen and get it.
          
          JULIET
          (calling from outside)
          He didn't seem strange, Alex.He seemed, you know --
          
          INT. BATHROOM.MORNING.
          
          Juliet watches the bath fill.
          
          JULIET
          ...interesting.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          Alex considers her reply.
          
          ALEX
          Interesting. Interesting.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          Alex is walking through the hall to the door,muttering 
          interesting' to himself. As he passes the phone starts to ring. 
          He stops and lifts it.
          
          ALEX
          Hello. No, she's not in. No. No. No. No ideas.
          
          Alex replaces the reciever and walks on to the door.
          
          JULIET
          (from the bathroom)
          Who was it?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? 
          Maybe it was just the emotion.
          
          Alex picks up the mail and looks through it. As he does so,David 
          emerges from his room, dressed for work.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          What do you think?
          
          DAVID
          About what?
          
          ALEX
          About this guy, this Hugo person.
          
          DAVID
          I don't have time.
          
          ALEX
          I'm only asking what you think.
          
          DAVID
          I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's 
          not a freak.
          
          David opens the door. Alex hands him an envelope.
          
          ALEX
          This is for you. It's your mother's handwriting, so I didn't open 
          it. I don't like reading about your father's constipation.
          
          David snatches the letter and leaves, closing the door.
          
          Alex walks back across the hall, opening one of the letters and 
          reading it quickly.
          
          JULIET
          (calling from the bathroom)
          So we'll meet him, then?
          
          ALEX
          What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this 
          guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and 
          descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft 
          touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused 
          and inflamed --'
          
          Juliet's hand and arm appear around the bathroom door. She 
          attempts to grab the letter. Alex plays at holding the letter 
          just beyond her reach.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Aroused and inflamed.
          
          JULIET
          Alex.
          
          ALEX
          He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign 
          someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. 
          Which I don't.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING
          
          Alex, David, Juliet and Hugo sit round a table towards the end of 
          a meal. Alcohol has been consumed. Bowls containing the last of 
          the food sit on the table, being picked at occassionally. Alex 
          dispenses wine mainly into his own glass, alternating with 
          Macallan malt whisky, of which he pours generous amounts.
          
          ALEX
          Interesting.
          
          HUGO
          I see.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're 
          here, you see.
          
          DAVID
          Normally I don't meet people, unless I know them already.
          
          HUGO
          I see.
          
          DAVID
          People can be so cruel.
          
          ALEX
          So, uh...
          
          HUGO
          What?
          
          ALEX
          What?
          
          HUGO
          You were going to say something.
          
          ALEX
          What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least 
          I suppose we think -- am I right?
          
          JULIET
          Just get on with it, Alex.
          
          DAVID
          Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
          
          ALEX
          We think it's fine.
          
          Alex starts eating again. The others watch him expectantly. David 
          coughs.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          It's OK. There's no problem.
          
          HUGO
          You mean I can have the room?
          
          ALEX
          Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
          
          DAVID
          He made it clear.
          
          ALEX
          Why, thank you, David.
          
          JULIET
          Yes, you can have the room.
          
          Alex pours yet more alcohol.
          
          ALEX
          I'm not usually drunk.
          
          JULIET
          Not usually this drunk.
          
          DAVID
          Only on expenses.
          
          ALEX
          It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
          
          With exaggerated scorn, Alex knocks over a glass of wine.
          
          JULIET
          In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
          
          ALEX
          It was you, Juliet, it was you --
          
          JULIET
          -- instead of what he is --
          
          ALEX
          What I am.
          
          JULIET
          -- which is --
          
          ALEX
          -- which is a hack.
          
          JULIET
          The man we know and love.
          
          ALEX
          A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- 
          Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Know and love?
          
          JULIET
          Yeah.
          
          ALEX
          I think you're lying.
          
          JULIET
          You're right.
          
          ALEX
          You see, they don't really know me.
          
          JULIET
          No, Alex, we don't really love you.
          
          Alex smiles at Juliet and drinks again.
          
          ALEX
          Can you afford this place?
          
          HUGO
          Yeah.
          
          Hugo reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick bundle of 
          notes, which he places in front of Alex. Alex leans over and 
          sniffs the notes.
          
          DAVID
          Can I ask you a question?
          
          HUGO
          Certainly.
          
          DAVID
          Have you ever killed a man? 
          HUGO
          No.
          
          DAVID
          Well, that's fair enough, then.
          
          Alex raises his head.
          
          ALEX
          Certainly smells like the real thing.
          
          EXT. A STREET. NIGHT
          
          At a cash dispenser a man in his thrities is taking out some 
          money.
          
          A younger man, Andy, stands besdie him, looking around in a 
          mildly agitated fashion.
          
          As the money emerges, Andy assaults and robs the man. He starts 
          by smashinf the victim's face repeatedly against the cash 
          dispenser until the Perspex is smeared with blood. When he has 
          final finished and the man lies on the ground, Andy takes the 
          money and the card from the slots, then gets into a car which has 
          pulled up alongside, driven by Tim.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
          
          Hugo climbs the stairs, carrying two suitcases. He stops at the 
          door of the flat and looks at a bunch of keys before selecting 
          one, which he inserts in the door.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Inside the flat. The door opens and Hugolifts his cases in, 
          kicking the door closed behind him.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet sleeps, undisturbed by the closing of the door.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Hugo walks across the halland disappears into his room.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Hugo unpackshis bags. Included in his things are a few syringes 
          and needles. All these he puts into the drawer beside his bed. He 
          checks inside a second bag.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Hugo dails a number on the telephone and awaits a reply.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. EVENING
          
          Juliet is woken by her alarm clock. The time is five p.m.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex sits watching television, constantly changing channels. 
          Juliet walks in, wearing a dressing gown. She watches Alex for a 
          few moments.
          
          JULIET
          Have you seen Hugo?
          
          ALEX
          No. Any idea which channel he's on?
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          The telephone is ringing. Alex lifts up the reciever. Again he is 
          wearing his dressing gown and is on his way to pick up the mail.
          
          ALEX
          No, she's not in. 
          Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks 
          to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the 
          door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Have you seen him?
          
          DAVID
          Alex, I don't have the time --
          
          ALEX
          Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          David leaves, slamming the door.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          Alex returns to the kitchen, pausing only to knock at Hugo's 
          door, which elicits no response. In the kitchen Juliet sits 
          dressed for work, having just returned. He casually opens an 
          envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing 
          it to her.
          
          ALEX
          David hasn't seen him either.
          
          JULIET
          So I gathered.
          
          ALEX
          Maybe he didn't like us.
          
          JULIET
          David?
          
          ALEX
          Hugo.
          
          JULIET
          His car's still there.
          
          ALEX
          He's got a car?
          
          JULIET
          So what's wrong with that?
          
          ALEX
          What sort of car?
          
          JULIET
          Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
          
          ALEX
          I will ask you once more, what sort of car -- 
          
          JULIET
          A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          We see the door to Hugo's room, then Alex rapping sharply against 
          it. David and Juliet stand behind him.
          
          ALEX
          Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, 
          Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's 
          not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
          
          JULIET
          Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
          
          ALEX
          So?
          
          JULIET
          Open it.
          
          ALEX
          You want me to kick it open?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          Now?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          ALEX
          All right. No problem.
          
          After several ineffective kicks at the door, Alex turns to David.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          You want a go?
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Inside Hugo's room we see the door as David, outside, throws 
          himself against it. At the third attempt the lock gives way and 
          the door bursts open.
          
          In the foreground at one side is the bed with a naked foot lying 
          still and exposed.
          
          When the door is open, David is first in, followed by the other 
          two. There is a period of silent shock as they contemplate Hugo's 
          naked corpse. Alex opens a window.
          
          DAVID
          Is this what they always look like?
          
          JULIET
          Yes.
          
          Juliet drapes a sheet over the body, covering it completely.
          
          ALEX
          I wonder how he did it?
          
          JULIET
          Did what?
          
          ALEX
          I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what 
          happened. What do you think?
          
          Quite casually, Alex begins to open drawers and cupboards, 
          emptying the contents on to the floor.
          
          JULIET
          Alex.
          
          ALEX
          What? What's wrong?
          
          JULIET
          What are you doing?
          
          ALEX
          I'm just looking.
          
          JULIET
          Don't.
          
          ALEX
          Don't look?
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you 
          wonder what he died from?
          
          JULIET
          No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
          
          ALEX
          It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
          
          JULIET
          Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
          
          ALEX
          Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be 
          rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
          
          In a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes 
          and a small bag of powder. Without comment, he holds it up and 
          throws it on the bed.
          
          He reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens. It 
          is empty and he pushes it back under.
          
          DAVID
          I've never seen a dead body before.
          
          JULIET
          Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
          
          Alex continues to search. Juliet walks out.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet stands alone.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex continues his brisk search through Hugo's posesseions while 
          David looks on, appalled but speechless.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom, then picks up the 
          telephone. She dials 999 and waits for a reply. It rings and 
          rings.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex has found and opened a large Gladstone bag. Neither David 
          norwe can see into it.
          
          DAVID
          I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. 
          I mean, she was alive at the time.
          
          ALEX
          Can I show you something?
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet awaits an answer.
          
          Alex approaches Juliet with the open bag. She turns around and 
          looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the 
          receiver. As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a 
          second.
          
          OPERATOR
          Hello, emergency services.
          
          The telephone hits the cradle.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          David, Alex and Juliet are seated in silence around the tabel. 
          The bag, stacked with money, lies open on the table.
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Think about it.
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Come on, David.
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Juliet?
          
          JULIET
          No, Alex. It's, it's --
          
          ALEX
          What?
          
          JULIET
          Unfeasible.
          
          ALEX
          Is that all?
          
          DAVID
          You mean immoral.
          
          ALEX
          I'm only asking you both to think about it.
          
          DAVID
          It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
          
          ALEX
          But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me 
          that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
          
          DAVID
          You think so?
          
          ALEX
          (AMUSED)
          All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try 
          again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them 
          there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          The flat is silent. Footsteps are heard outside the door and mail 
          falls through the letter box.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          The living room, empty.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          The kitchen, empty. The bag of money still sits on the table.
          
          INT. HUGO'S BEDROOM. DAY
          
          His corpse lies on the bed, covered as before, incompletely, by a 
          sheet, with parts of his body still showing (a foot, a hand, part 
          of his face or abdomen).
          
          INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
          
          The open-plan office of a busy newspaper. Alex sits at his desk. 
          He is talking on a telephone jammed against his shoulder and 
          while he does so he is casually acknowledging and waving at 
          colleagues.
          
          ALEX
          Now, was there a pet in the house? Yes, a pet, like a dog or a 
          budgie or a gerbil. You see, what I need is PC Plod rescues Harry 
          the Hamster from House of Horror'. All right... well, that's a 
          pity, you see, no pets, no human angle.
          
          Alex hangs up.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Another view of the body: for example, from above.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
          
          In the accident and emeregency department of a busy hospital, 
          Juliet sifts through a setof casenotes. Another Doctor approaches 
          her.
          
          DOCTOR
          Hi, there.
          
          Juliet does not look up.
          
          JULIET
          Hello.
          
          DOCTOR
          What happened to that guy?
          
          JULIET
          What guy?
          
          DOCTOR
          That guy, the one that died.
          
          Juliet looks up.
          
          JULIET
          What guy that died?
          
          DOCTOR
          That one, last week.
          
          JULIET
          Here?.
          
          DOCTOR
          Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
          
          JULIET
          Oh, him. Well, he died.
          
          DOCTOR
          (SATISFIED)
          That's what I thought.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The body, stillpresent, exposed and motionless. The curtain 
          flutters by the open window.
          
          INT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Lumsden, a middle-aged chartered accountant, isseated in a 
          largechair behind a desk. He is talking to David,who appears 
          distracted.
          
          LUMSDEN
          What do we do here, David?
          
          DAVID
          Sorry?
          
          LUMSDEN
          Here.
          
          DAVID
          Right here?
          
          LUMSDEN
          In this firm.
          
          DAVID
          Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
          
          LUMSDEN
          Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
          
          DAVID
          Exactly what I was --
          
          LUMSDEN
          -- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
          
          DAVID
          Not any real sneering as such, no.
          
          LUMSDEN
          There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be 
          accounted for, doesn't it?
          
          DAVID
          Eh --
          
          LUMSDEN
          But they sneer, don't they?
          
          DAVID
          I'm not sure --
          
          LUMSDEN
          Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, 
          we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in 
          that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe 
          sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job 
          done.
          
          DAVID
          Yes, sir.
          
          LUMSDEN
          And that's why I think you fit in here.
          
          DAVID
          I'm boring?
          
          LUMSDEN
          You get the job done.
          
          DAVID
          Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
          
          LUMSDEN
          Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
          
          Lumsden throws a heavy folder into David's lap.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING
          
          It is almost dark.Only the familiar contour is visible through 
          the gloom.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. EVENING
          
          David ascends the stairs to the flat.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING
          
          Alex sits in an armchair facing out of the window. Juliet stands 
          facing into the room. David, the last home, appears in the 
          doorway.
          
          DAVID
          He's still here.
          
          ALEX
          He couldn't get his car started.
          
          DAVID
          When are you going to let the police know?
          
          ALEX
          You call them if you want.
          
          DAVID
          (to Juliet)
          And what about you?
          
          JULIET
          Well, I'm getting used to having him around.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The corpse as before.
          
          INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          David sits at his desk, looking across the office.
          
          Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women 
          in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is 
          speaking except in muted tones on the telephones.
          
          David watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on 
          either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He 
          turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants 
          sit.
          
          He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously 
          given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large 
          total at the bottom.
          
          When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She 
          smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding 
          scene.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING
          
          The body in silhouette.
          
          DAVID
          (VOICE-OVER)
          OK. Let's do it.
          
          INT. DIY STORE. DAY
          
          Inside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the 
          background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked 
          with potentially vicious tools.
          
          ALEX
          (VOICE-OVER)
          All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a 
          way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, 
          then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, 
          dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either 
          by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I 
          have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the 
          forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which 
          we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as 
          simple as that.
          
          As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as 
          he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded 
          screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few 
          millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is 
          holding it.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          I always wondered what these were for.
          
          Alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across 
          the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Now this is what we need. And this. 
          
          Alex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust. 
          Alex walks on.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Now what else? 
          DAVID
          I don't know.
          
          ALEX
          A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we 
          need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
          
          DAVID
          So who's going to do it?
          
          ALEX
          Dig the pit, I don't know.
          
          DAVID
          No, not that.
          
          ALEX
          Then what? Who's going to do what?
          
          DAVID
          You know what I'm talking about.
          
          ALEX
          Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
          
          DAVID
          You know what. Who's going to do it.
          
          ALEX
          We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me 
          and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
          
          DAVID
          I can't do it.
          
          ALEX
          I don't hear this.
          
          DAVID
          I won't be able to.
          
          ALEX
          You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you 
          don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat 
          smells. We can't wait any longer.
          
          DAVID
          I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
          
          Alex turns away in disgust.
          
          EXT. LANE. NIGHT
          
          Late at night, in a quiet lane at the back of the flat, a hired 
          Ford Transit is parked.
          
          INT. VAN. NIGHT
          
          Inside the dimly lit van, Alex and Juliet are laying down plastic 
          on the floor.
          
          JULIET
          Who's going to do it?
          
          ALEX
          I thought we all were.
          
          JULIET
          I don't thinkI can.
          
          ALEX
          But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
          
          JULIET
          I don't want to. It's different.
          
          ALEX
          And now you tell me.
          
          INT. UNDER WATER/BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          A Man's face is being held under water. Bubbles escape from his 
          mouth and his eys bulge.
          
          Tim hauls the Man's head out of the bath. His legs and arms are 
          bound with cord. Andy sits on a chair, watching.
          
          Tim ducks the Man's head under the water again.
          
          The Man's face as before.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          We see Hugo's face just before Alex, David and Juliet wrap him in 
          a sheet and thick, black plastic. They wear masks over their 
          noses. The smell is making them uncomfortable and irritable.
          
          DAVID
          There's something I want to ask.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          The Man's head has just been lifted from the water.
          
          MAN
          I don't know. I swear to God, I don't know.
          
          Tim ducks the Man's head back under the water.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          (angry through his mask)
          Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of 
          the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
          
          DAVID
          I just thought we should discuss it.
          
          ALEX
          Take his legs.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
          
          In the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, 
          David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down 
          the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and 
          go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic 
          after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They 
          swear at one another and continue theri descent.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          Tim is ducking the Man again. He writhes and struggles but is 
          powerless to stop it.
          
          EXT. BEHIND THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          The back yard and back door of the flats. The door opens and 
          Alex, David and Juliet emerge, carrying the corpse out towards 
          the van.
          
          INT. LANDING OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM. NIGHT
          
          From the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom. 
          The Man's legs extend away from the bath. They are completely 
          still. Andy and Tim stand beside them, looking down.
          
          ANDY
          You stupid bastard.
          
          INT. VAN. NIGHT
          
          Inside the back of the empty van. The door is opened and the body 
          is half slid and half thrown inside. The door is closed and in 
          the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just 
          visible, thanks to a streetlight. One of the doors opens again 
          and David throws a bag of tools in. He then closes and locks the 
          door.
          
          INT. VAN. NIGHT
          
          In front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side. 
          Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel. 
          Alex turns to the other two.
          
          ALEX
          Why don't we just draw lots for it?
          
          The other two remain silent.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either 
          do it or you don't. All or nothing.
          
          JULIET
          OK.
          
          ALEX
          David?
          
          DAVID
          I don't know.
          
          ALEX
          Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not 
          going to do it just because you won't.
          
          Alex starts the engine of the van.
          
          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
          
          Through the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of 
          the van come into view.
          
          It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is 
          switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the 
          van.
          
          In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David 
          and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of 
          grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds 
          them out.
          
          ALEX
          All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play 
          or not?
          
          Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one 
          of the stems. It is one of the larger ones.
          
          Alex and Juliet turn to David. Alex holds out the stems. David 
          reaches out and takes one of the tips. It is the short straw.
          
          DAVID
          I can't do it.
          
          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
          
          Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little 
          light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His 
          right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a 
          vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished 
          with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at 
          another.
          
          Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He 
          observes David impassively. The sawing stops again.
          
          DAVID
          Finished.
          
          ALEX
          But not quite.
          
          DAVID
          Is that going to be deep enough?
          
          Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards 
          David.
          
          ALEX
          Don't you worry about that.
          
          DAVID
          Is this necessary?
          
          ALEX
          Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
          
          Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who 
          gestures as if to say, "On you go.' With revulsion on his face, 
          he raises the hammer above his head.
          
          INT. DAVID'S ROOM. DAY
          
          David's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his 
          pillow.
          
          He lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling. 
          There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in.
          
          JULIET
          Are you all right?
          
          DAVID
          (without looking at Juliet)
          Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
          
          JULIET
          Would you like to talk about it?
          
          DAVID
          No.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          Alex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show, while 
          eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer. Newspapers lie 
          scattered at his feet.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          The loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened, 
          letting in a pool of light.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft. 
          Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the 
          ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters 
          the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it 
          on up to David.
          
          JULIET
          Be careful.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall 
          through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
          
          JULIET
          Stop nagging.
          
          ALEX
          (to himself)
          I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it 
          under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it 
          in the fridge.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way 
          across beams and pipes. There are no skylights.
          
          He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He 
          strains to see in the darkness.
          
          Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water 
          empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward, 
          tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch. 
          Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across 
          some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, 
          the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old 
          brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out.
          
          David scrambles towards the trapdoor.
          
          INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Now clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
          
          In a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the 
          ceiling. Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For 
          Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'. On the floor of this area are 
          yellow plastic sacks. Juliet appears around a corner carrying one 
          of these. Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues 
          past.
          
          EXT. QUARRY. EVENING
          
          Alex pushes a blue car into a quary.
          
          INT. SUBURBAN LOCK-UP GARAGE. NIGHT
          
          In the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks 
          of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which 
          sit Andy and Tim. Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to 
          Andy, who declines.
          
          They slide off the deep freeze and open it.
          
          Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord. 
          They lift him up. He is very cold and weak.
          
          The Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that 
          he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly.
          
          They push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid 
          while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top.
          
          INT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is 
          dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the 
          addition of a significant number of kilts.
          
          Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a 
          number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak 
          to them.
          
          A middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is 
          standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to 
          the diners who are still sat at their tables.
          
          MC
          Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of 
          all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting 
          our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit.
          
          There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to 
          the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans 
          across to Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. 
          I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down.
          
          Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex.
          
          JULIET
          Sshh.
          
          ALEX
          I want my money back. Excuse me.
          
          Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his 
          fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already 
          ists in front of him.
          
          MC
          For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of 
          mind, let someone else bother about these things.
          
          Alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own. Juliet nudges 
          him viciously.
          
          MC
          (CONTINUED)
          But just before the dancing, I'd like to say a special thank-you 
          to a few of the people who've worked so very hard to make this 
          occassion happen.
          
          The MC's drone continues in the background while conversation 
          continues back at the table.
          
          DAVID
          Do you know many of these people?
          
          JULIET
          Yes. They're my friends.
          
          ALEX
          I see, so if they want to talk to you, we say you're not in.
          
          MC
          And now, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who are neither 
          or both --
          
          Drum roll.
          
          MC
          (CONTINUED)
          -- would you make your way to the floor for Strip the Willow.
          
          JULIET
          Are we going to dance?
          
          ALEX
          Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?
          
          INT. DANCE FLOOR. NIGHT
          
          The dance floor a few minutes later. It is packed and rather 
          chaotic. Sweaty, dishevelled dancers sling one another around, 
          with the thud of flesh against flesh. Toes are stood on and 
          jackets discarded.
          
          Juliet dances with Alex, who plunges in with the maximum of 
          violence, eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among 
          the other dancers.
          
          He starts to get up, then rests his head back against the floor.
          
          David has not been dancing. Instead he remains at their table and 
          at the bar, drinking steadily and watching the other two.
          
          INT. TABLE. NIGHT
          
          Back at the table, while most people are still on the dnace 
          floor, the trio sit drinking and Alex smokes a cigar.
          
          ALEX
          That was good.
          
          DAVID
          Can we talk about something?
          
          ALEX
          Not now. I have an idea.
          
          Alex pours champagne on to a stack of glasses.
          
          DAVID
          Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to 
          do --
          
          ALEX
          Just stop worrying.
          
          Alex stands and raises his glass.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Love and happiness for ever.
          
          JULIET
          For ever and ever.
          
          Alex drinks, then puts his glass down. Juliet drinks but does not 
          drain her glass. David sits still.
          
          ALEX
          What's the problem?
          
          DAVID
          I want to talk now.
          
          ALEX
          After you drink to love and happiness forever.
          
          DAVID
          Now.
          
          ALEX
          After.
          
          JULIET
          David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
          
          ALEX
          It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
          
          David reaches out to take his glass. Suddenly, Alex flings an arm 
          out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing 
          interest.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Look over there. It's Cameron.
          
          JULIET
          Who?
          
          ALEX
          Cameron. You remember Cameron.
          
          JULIET
          No, I don't.
          
          ALEX
          What's he doing here?
          
          JULIET
          That's not him.
          
          ALEX
          Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
          
          From some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and 
          cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from 
          the table.
          
          CAMERON
          What?
          
          ALEX
          Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
          
          Alex falls forward, laughing, and the other two also laugh as 
          Cameron walks away, humiliated again.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us 
          around?
          
          DAVID
          Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
          
          BRIAN
          (UNSEEN)
          The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
          
          Brian approaches and is standing behind their table.
          
          JULIET
          Brian.
          
          BRIAN
          Would you care to dance?
          
          DAVID
          Hold on there. Who do you think you are?
          
          BRIAN
          What?
          
          DAVID
          Who do you think you are? You interrupted us.
          
          BRIAN
          I'm Brian McKinley, and who are you?
          
          DAVID
          Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you 
          talk to me first. If you want to dance with her, then you apply 
          in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a 
          fucking bin-bag. You didn't apply, so you don't dance.
          
          Shocked and frightened, Brian backs away, then turns around to 
          complete his departure. Juliet restrains David with a touch as 
          they watch him go.
          
          JULIET
          Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
          
          DAVID
          I'm sorry.
          
          JULIET
          It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
          
          DAVID
          That was stressful. I found that stressful.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', 
          I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the 
          full there.
          
          DAVID
          You think so?
          
          JULIET
          Well, you certainly had a good look around.
          
          ALEX
          You were magnificent.
          
          INT. TOILETS. NIGHT
          
          The gents' toilet. Brightly-lit and white-tiled. Alex walk in and 
          goes into a cubicle and closes the door. We hear him whistling 
          and laughing as he passes urine. He keeps muttering bin-bag' to 
          himself. Then he flushes the toilet and opens the door. As he 
          does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone 
          waiting for him.
          
          ALEX
          Cameron! What a surprise.
          
          As Alex is speaking Cameron's fist flies forward, hitting him in 
          the face and sending him flying backwards. Cameron enters the 
          cubicle and closes the door behind him.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          Mail falls through the letter box.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING.
          
          Alex does not stir.
          
          INT. HALL. MORNING
          
          David emerges from his room, ready for his work. He looks towards 
          the kitchen, then walks to the door and opens it.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          We hear the main door closing as David leaves. Alex jolts with 
          energy with every sound. The telephone begins to ring. Juliet 
          looks at Alex expectantly, but he does not move. Eventually she 
          gets up and answers it.
          
          JULIET
          Hello. Hello.
          
          ALEX
          Who was it?
          
          JULIET
          Don't know. No one said anything.
          ALEX
          Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the 
          days when I had such a thing.
          
          JULIET
          Are you all right?
          
          ALEX
          No.
          
          JULIET
          Then let's spend some money.
          
          INT. FLAT. DAY
          
          There follows a video depicting the results of Alex's and 
          Juliet's spending spree. It opens with Alex seated at the kitchen 
          table talking to the camera, absolutely deadpan.
          
          ALEX
          Hello. It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over, 
          the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden 
          sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same 
          again.
          
          Alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play 
          button on a tape recorder. The music begins.
          
          Fast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots 
          of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is 
          switched on and off.
          
          Alex wearing several different suits, outfits and silk pyjamas.
          
          Juliet wearing several different outfits.
          
          Both of them posing with small objets d'art.
          
          The expensive watch on Alex's wrist.
          
          Juliet's jewellery.
          
          Expensive toys.
          
          Juliet takes a picture of Alex with a Polaroid camera.
          
          Alex holds the camcorder out at arm's length in order to film 
          himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and 
          you know, I'm so happy I could die.
          
          Darkness. TV. Turned off.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          The music has stopped.
          
          David presses the eject button and lifts the video from the 
          player.
          
          Alex and Juliet are seated on the sofa, surrounded by their 
          acquisitions, and are evidently a little embarrassed. Juliet is 
          holding the Polaroid of Alex.
          
          DAVID
          I think we ought to scrub this, don't you?
          
          David reinserts the tape and presses record.
          
          ALEX
          Will you calm down.
          
          JULIET
          Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
          
          David picks up the Polaroid of Alex and throws it down, then 
          picks up a vase.
          
          DAVID
          How much did you pay?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          DAVID
          How much did you pay?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          DAVID
          How much?
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          JULIET
          Two hundred.
          
          DAVID
          Two hundred pounds?
          
          JULIET
          Two hundred pounds.
          
          DAVID
          You paid two hundred pounds for this?
          
          JULIET
          That's what it cost, David.
          
          DAVID
          No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is 
          what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you 
          two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
          
          From out in the hall, the phone starts to ring. Nobody moves.
          
          INT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David lies awake in his bed.
          
          INT. A FLAT HALLWAY. NIGHT
          
          Hearing the noise, David sits up in bed, then gets out, reaching 
          for his clothes.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
          
          David looks down the stairwell. Other neighbours, in nightclothes 
          or hurriedly dressed, are standing at the open door of the flat 
          below. David descends the the stairs and looks into the hall of 
          the other flat where the occupant, an Elderly Woman, lies 
          groaning on the floor.
          
          A hand on David's shoulder pushes him out of the way and two 
          uniformed policemen walk past, followed by an ambulance man 
          carrying a stretcher.
          
          DAVID
          Did they take anything? Did they take anything?
          
          No one acknowledges his question or answers it.
          
          The ambulance men emerge carrying the woman, her face bruised and 
          cut. Everyone else begins to melt away.
          
          INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
          
          David stands alone on the darkened stairwell.
          
          INT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David lies awake in his bed.
          
          INT. DOOR OF THE FLAT. DAY
          
          Someone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are 
          two new security chains on the inside. The door is forced against 
          the chains with no success and Alex calls from the other side.
          
          ALEX
          What is this? What is going on? David!
          
          David approaches the door.
          
          DAVID
          I'll let you in.
          
          David closes the door and looks through a new spyhole to see Alex 
          grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the 
          door again. Alex walks in.
          
          ALEX
          What is this?
          
          DAVID
          Security.
          
          DAVID
          From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
          
          DAVID
          There was a break-in.
          
          ALEX
          Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
          
          Alex hands David a rolled-up newspaper.
          
          DAVID
          Doesn't it worry you?
          
          ALEX
          No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've 
          worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's 
          terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a 
          pensioner it'll worry me.
          
          Alex notices some more tools and the stepladder leading up to the 
          trapdoor.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          What's all this for, more security?
          
          DAVID
          I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
          
          ALEX
          Oh, that'll come in useful.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Alex is serving on plates from a large bowl of pasta.
          
          David and Juliet sit at the tabel.
          
          JULIET
          Is this the same stuff you made last week?
          
          ALEX
          No, no, it's different.
          
          JULIET
          I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
          
          ALEX
          It tastes different.
          
          JULIET
          I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is 
          that enough for you? Hey!
          
          DAVID
          What? Yes, that's fine.
          
          ALEX
          You're sure? There's lots more.
          
          DAVID
          No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
          
          ALEX
          What's wrong?
          
          DAVID
          Nothing.
          
          ALEX
          You're not eating.
          
          DAVID
          Not eating what?
          
          ALEX
          Not eating like you used to, that's what.
          
          DAVID
          If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
          
          Alex hands him the plate and he starts to eat. Alex watches him 
          chew a mouthful.
          
          ALEX
          Now swallow.
          
          David does so.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying 
          about it. That's my advice.
          
          JULIET
          He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
          
          David has stopped eating.
          
          ALEX
          Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
          
          JULIET
          Be like a weight off your shoulders.
          
          ALEX
          You know we're right.
          
          JULIET
          Don't you?
          
          DAVID
          I want to secure it.
          
          ALEX
          Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? 
          You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take 
          it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
          
          JULIET
          I don't see the point in that.
          
          ALEX
          Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the 
          money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's 
          underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you 
          can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's 
          nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this 
          for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
          
          DAVID
          Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.
          
          There is silence. David resumes eating.
          
          DAVID
          (CONTINUED)
          It tastes different.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex stands at the sink doing some washing up. He hears footsteps 
          from the loft above. He stops what he is doing and walks slowly 
          out ot the hall.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          In the darkness we can just make out David's eyes as he sits in 
          darkness.
          
          ALEX
          (calling from below)
          David, David, what are you doing up there?
          
          The torch goes on. David lifts the bag of money from between the 
          rafters. He puts it inside another thick yellow plastic bag, 
          which he ties tightly with string.
          
          David opens the water tank.
          
          Alex's voice can be heard throughout.
          
          ALEX
          (continued; calling from below)
          Will you come down now. It's not safe up there. Are you listening 
          to me. Security and insanity are not the same thing.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          Shit.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Juliet sits drinking coffee, while Alex sands in the doorway 
          looking up towards the trapdoor.
          
          JULIET
          Leave him alone.
          
          ALEX
          He can't stay up there.
          
          JULIET
          He'll come down. Leave him alone.
          
          ALEX
          Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come 
          down for that?
          
          JULIET
          No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
          
          ALEX
          Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
          
          Juliet looks through the door from a small office out into the 
          main waiting area in the casualty departmet. It is busy and there 
          are rooms of people nursing injuries waiting to be seen. More 
          file past the door while she watches with no enthusiasm.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          The trapdoor opens. David's head appears. He looks around and 
          listens carfeully.
          
          INT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Lumsden answers his telephone.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David speaks on the telephone.
          
          DAVID
          It's my mother, sir, she's very ill and I think I need to be with 
          her just now. I don't know. The doctors aren't sure. It could go 
          either way. Yes, sir, I'll certainly stay in touch.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. DAY
          
          David shaves carefully with a safety razor.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Bacon and eggs fry in a pan. David attends to them while drinking 
          from a large tumbler of orange juice.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
          
          A Sister hands Juliet a casualty case sheet. Juliet reads it.
          
          JULIET
          Painful groin? What does that mean?
          
          SISTER
          I don't know. He wouldn't show me.
          
          Juliet draws back the curtain of a cubicle. Alex is sitting on a 
          trolly. 
          ALEX
          Boy, am I glad to see you.
          
          JULIET
          What are you doing here?
          
          ALEX
          We have to talk.
          
          JULIET
          Your painful groin?
          
          She turns and walks away. Alex chases after her.
          
          ALEX
          Later. But first -- him.
          
          JULIET
          David?
          
          ALEX
          Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
          
          JULIET
          Oh, good.
          
          ALEX
          He won't do anything for me, but for you --
          
          JULIET
          Forget it.
          
          ALEX
          He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use 
          your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
          
          JULIET
          And the money?
          
          ALEX
          We could put it somewhere.
          
          JULIET
          Where he can't get it?
          
          ALEX
          Now you thought of that, not me.
          
          JULIET
          Forget it -- he'll come down.
          
          Juliet walks away.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          The hall is empty and the flat is silent. We see the trapdoor.
          
          INT. LOFT. EVENING
          
          David sits in the darkness. A crack of light penetrates beside 
          the trapdoor.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Alex and Juliet sit at the table, eating in silence.
          
          The doorbell rings. Alex and Juliet look at one another.
          
          ALEX
          Expecting anyone?
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          ALEX
          Oh.
          
          Alex resumes eating.
          
          JULIET
          Aren't you going to answer it?
          
          ALEX
          Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
          
          Juliet glares at him.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex approaches the door and is about to open it. At the last 
          moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole.
          
          INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT
          
          Tim and Andy stand outside the door.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening 
          the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as 
          the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat.
          
          In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into 
          the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words 
          apart from slightly muffled cries.
          
          At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a 
          crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's 
          shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into 
          Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly 
          again, he takes the crowbar out.
          
          ALEX
          It's in the loft.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can 
          just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a 
          shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool 
          around the opening.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform 
          darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is 
          David. He stands perfectly still.
          
          There is a hammer in his right hand.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Tim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts 
          himself through and balances on the beams.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly 
          there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing 
          heavily on and across some beams in the loft.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Andy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else 
          but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living 
          room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks 
          back and up towards the trapdoor.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor. 
          Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering 
          into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the 
          light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and 
          he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He 
          looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy 
          lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour 
          out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a 
          second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only 
          centimetres from his own.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud 
          thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then 
          Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down 
          to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his 
          head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes 
          one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his 
          mouth.
          
          Tim's body lands on Andy.
          
          David drops himself from the hatch to the floor.
          
          David takes a large knife from a wooden block.
          
          Back in the hall he kneels, holding the knife, beside Tim. 
          Noticing something at the top of tim's neck, he uses the knife to 
          lift away Tim's T-shirt. A tattoo covers Tim's neck. David looks 
          at it, then stands up.
          
          He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still 
          bound, watch him approach. He looks at them for a moment, then 
          extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place.
          
          EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
          
          In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's 
          shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen. He stops 
          and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above 
          his head.
          
          EXT. ROAD. DAWN
          
          The van is silhouetted against a rising sun.
          
          INT. BACK OF THE VAN. DAWN
          
          The tools and the yellow sack slide about in the back of the van.
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          David is driving. Alex and Juliet are huddled silently away from 
          him. David seems quite at ease.
          
          A thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition. Juliet observes 
          them.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David sits still in the darkness.
          
          INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
          
          Alex sits at his desk fidgeting, about to write something but 
          unable to start. On the screen of his word processor is a page 
          mock-up with the headline CATS EAT PENSIONER'. As the telephone 
          on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts 
          it fractionally and replaces it.
          
          INT. TRAVEL AGENT'S. DAY
          
          Hunched over a VDU, the Salesman is offering Juliet a range of 
          flights.
          
          SALESMAN
          October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, 
          British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five 
          pounds. Seven six five.
          
          JULIET
          That sounds fine.
          
          SALESMAN
          Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five 
          hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering 
          important?
          
          JULIET
          What?
          
          SALESMAN
          Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong 
          end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's 
          up to you.
          
          JULIET
          Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
          
          SALESMAN
          It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot 
          . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good 
          value, but refueling at Bogot is variable.
          
          JULIET
          The first one was fine.
          
          SALESMAN
          Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The hall is empty but we can hear David's footsteps on the beams 
          above.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Alex sits watching The Wicker Man on televison. He can hear the 
          footsteps above. He turns the sound up on the television so that 
          he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as 
          though he expects to hear them or see somwthing.
          
          Eventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's 
          silence, the footsteps start again, back and forth, then stop.
          
          Alex looks up.
          
          Without warning there is the sound of an electric drill.
          
          The blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then 
          withdrawn. Alex is shocked. Other drill holes appear.
          
          INT. VARIOUS CEILINGS. NIGHT
          
          Holes are drilled in the ceilings.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Rods of light penetrate up from the holes, interrupting but not 
          obliterating the darknes. David sits back, pleased with his work.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Juliet sits at her desk. Alex stands in the doorway. He is about 
          to speak. Juliet raises a finger to her lips. They both look at 
          the ceiling.
          
          EXT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          Establishing shot of Alex and Juliet in garden.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          The trapdoor is open.
          
          INT. ALEX'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David is searching through Alex's desk, looking through letters 
          and folders, then shoving them back into drawers.
          
          EXT. GARDEN AT THE FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it 
          further.
          
          JULIET
          It's the only way.
          
          ALEX
          I refuse.
          
          JULIET
          You're frightened.
          
          ALEX
          No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see 
          what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive 
          and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead 
          dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He 
          killed them both: he cut them up.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David is now searching through Juliet's desk. He picks up a large 
          brown envelope and looks into it. Beneath it is the airline 
          ticket envelope.
          
          The doorbell rings.
          
          INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT
          
          McCall and Mitchell stand outside the door.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          David opens the door. McCall smiles.
          
          MCCALL
          Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC 
          Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
          
          DAVID
          What about?
          
          MCCALL
          It's about the burglary.
          
          DAVID
          Burglary?
          
          MCCALL
          Downstairs.
          
          DAVID
          Of course.
          
          MCCALL
          Can we come in?
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          David sits on the sofa while the two policemen sit on armchairs 
          several feet apart.
          
          DAVID
          So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went 
          downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just 
          stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and 
          then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And 
          that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, 
          I don't think.
          
          MCCALL
          did you hear anything before he cries?
          
          DAVID
          No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
          
          MCCALL
          Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the 
          last few days?
          
          DAVID
          No, nothing, sorry.
          
          MCCALL
          Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
          
          DAVID
          Of course.
          
          MCCALL
          And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
          
          DAVID
          There are only two other people in the flat. 
          
          McCall consults a notebook.
          
          MCCALL
          Two?
          
          DAVID
          Who said there were four?
          
          MCCALL
          We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of 
          course, but now, four.
          
          DAVID
          No, three. Who said there were four?
          
          MCCALL
          How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading 
          information. Only three people here. You're sure?
          
          DAVID
          Yes, absolutely.
          
          MCCALL
          Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. 
          Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no 
          preference. Which are you using?
          
          MITCHELL
          Both, sir.
          
          MCCALL
          Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my 
          tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
          
          DAVID
          I see.
          
          MCCALL
          I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
          
          DAVID
          No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
          
          MCCALL
          Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
          
          DAVID
          I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
          
          Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even 
          this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has 
          underlined a short segment of it.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          In the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door, 
          waiting to leave. McCall is kneeling at the door to Hugo's room, 
          tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock. David looks 
          on.
          
          MCCALL
          Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
          
          DAVID
          Someone lost the key.
          
          McCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall 
          illuminates Hugo's room.
          
          MCCALL
          Is this where no one stays?
          
          DAVID
          Yeah, that's right, that's it.
          
          David notices that Mitchell is writing this down.
          
          INT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT
          
          ALEX
          You'll wait in the hall?
          
          JULIET
          I'll wait there.
          
          ALEX
          And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, 
          you'll tell them everything?
          
          JULIET
          Everything.
          
          ALEX
          Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the 
          first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die 
          misunderstood. 
          
          JULIET
          Alex.
          
          ALEX
          What?
          
          JULIET
          As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
          
          She hands Alex a Yale key. Alex stares at it.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          In the darkness, the sound of the lock being turned is heard.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex tsands at the top of the ladder, holding the key in the 
          trapdoor lock.
          
          ALEX
          All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this 
          lock and I'm going to come up, and what's important is that you 
          remain calm.
          
          There is one light on. Juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder. 
          Having opened the trapdoor, Alex stops and listens, but there is 
          no sound above his own breathing. Juliet throws up a torch, which 
          he catches. He switches it on. It shines, then goes out, and he 
          knocks it against the ladder, making it work again. Slowly he 
          pushes the trapdoor open.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          The trapdoor opens. Below it, Alex crouches on the ladder, 
          expecting attack at any moment. He looks back down to Juliet, who 
          returns his gaze, then he slowly raises himself into the loft.
          
          He turns around quickly, darting the torchlight around into 
          corners and squinting in the darkness, but he sees nothing.
          
          The torch goes out. Cursing, he knocks it against a beam and it 
          shines again.
          
          Slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the 
          loft, still turning around and worried about what might be behind 
          him.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet stands waiting, braced for sounds of conflict.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex is still looking but has relaxed a little, feeling les in 
          danger. In one corner he notices David's pile of left-possessions 
          and the mat on which he has been sleeping. He moves towards it.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Juliet stands, still waiting.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex stands in David's corner. With another sweep of the torch he 
          can still see nothing. He calls to Juliet.
          
          ALEX
          He isn't up here.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          A close-up of Juliet's face, just as David's hand slams across 
          her mouth, gripping her tightly while his other hand clamps on 
          the back of her head. David's mouth is right up against her ear 
          as he spits a warning into it.
          
          DAVID
          Tell him to look for the money.
          
          Slowly, David relaxes his grip on Juliet.
          
          JULIET
          Look for the money.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex, cheerful now, is looking in the rafters.
          
          ALEX
          Don't worry, that's what I'm doing.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          David holds Juliet across her face again. She is terrified and 
          does not struggle.
          
          DAVID
          Expecting anyone?
          
          JULIET
          What?
          
          DAVID
          Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
          
          JULIET
          No.
          
          DAVID
          Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
          
          JULIET
          No one. I promise.
          
          DAVID
          Who have you talked to?
          
          JULIET
          No one.
          
          DAVID
          If I think you're lying --
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex stands gazing around the loft.
          
          ALEX
          (from the loft)
          Well, it's not up here.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          David pulls Juliet to one side.
          
          INT. LOFT. NIGHT
          
          Alex is about to descend when he notices the water tank. He walks 
          over and lifts the lid. His face breaks into a smile as he 
          realizes what it holds. He dips an arm into the tank, raises the 
          yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again. Alex steps back from 
          the water tank.
          
          INT. HALL. NIGHT
          
          Alex appears at the top of the ladder. Without looking, he slides 
          down as quickly as he can, calling out as he does so.
          
          ALEX
          Juliet, I have --
          
          Alex reaches the base of the ladder. He turns around to find 
          himself facing the blade of the battery-operated drill, held by 
          David. Juliet stands off to one side.
          
          ALEX
          (CONTINUED)
          -- a problem.
          
          David holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the 
          centre of Alex's forehead and presses the trigger' to turn the 
          blade slowly as he speaks.
          
          Alex does not move at all.
          
          DAVID
          You looking for me?
          
          ALEX
          Looking for you? Yes.
          
          DAVID
          What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
          
          ALEX
          We just wanted to speak to you.
          
          Alex's hands and sleeves are wet. A few drops of water fall from 
          his fingertips. Unnoticed by the other two, he slowly wipes his 
          hands on the back of his jeans.
          
          DAVID
          Who else have you wanted to speak to? Maybe you thought they'd 
          already got me.
          
          The blade os the drill scrapes Alex's skin.
          
          ALEX
          Who?
          
          DAVID
          Your friends.
          
          ALEX
          I don't know what you're talking about.
          
          JULIET
          He doesn't know David.
          
          David holds the drill back slightly while he thinks. It could go 
          either way.
          
          DAVID
          Well, maybe you don't --
          
          David lowers the drill and smiles.
          
          DAVID
          (CONTINUED)
          I'm talking about the police.
          
          INT. ALEX'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Alex has just woken up. He rubs his forehead. There is a nick in 
          it, where the drill has scratched. He rubs at it and examines the 
          drop of blood on the end of his finger.
          
          INT. DAVID'S POINT OF VIEW. ALEX'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Looking down from a hole in the ceiling, we see into Alex's room, 
          where he is getting dressed.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          Alex leaves his room and enters the hall.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          Looking down from a hole in the ceiling, we see into Alex's room, 
          where he is getting dressed.
          
          INT. LOFT/HALL. DAY
          
          Looking down on Alex as he leaves the flat and closes the door.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David scurries back across the beams to look down through another 
          hole. He looks for several seconds.
          
          NOTE In the following sequence, Juliet's face is not seen until 
          her comment on it. 
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet lies on her bed. She throws the covers back.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David is still looking down through the hole.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet moves about her room. She is wearing a large, baggy T-
          shirt.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David still watching.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Juliet's legs are seen as the T-shirt lands on the floor beside 
          them.
          
          INT. LOFT. DAY
          
          David sits back suddenly, recoiling from the activity. He 
          scrambles back across to his mat, where he sits back down and 
          closes his eyes. Then he opens them and scrambles back to look 
          down again.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The room is empty.
          
          The sound of the flat door closing is heard.
          
          From David's point of view we see:
          
          INT. LOFT/HALL (EMPTY). DAY
          
          INT. LOFT/LIVING ROOM (EMPTY). DAY
          
          INT. LOFT/KITCHEN (EMPTY). DAY
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David's head appears beneath the trapdoor. He hangs from the 
          hatch and drops down to the floor.
          
          INT. BATHROOM. DAY
          
          David showers.
          
          INT. HALL. DAY
          
          David emerges from the bathroom and walks towards the kitchen. We 
          follow him in.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          David takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a 
          glass. He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that 
          we cannot see. The expression oh his face does not change and his 
          voice is impassive.
          
          DAVID
          I thought you'd gone to work.
          
          JULIET
          (UNSEEN)
          With a face like this?
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Juliet's face. There are bruises across it where she was gripped 
          by David.
          
          INT. MONITOR SCREEN/NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
          
          In close-up we track along the following half-sentence: In the 
          event of my death I want the following facts to be known:' --
          
          The remainder of the screen is blank.
          
          Alex sits at his desk, deciding what to type next on the screen 
          seen before. A young Office Boy approaches his desk.
          
          OFFICE BOY
          The editor wants to see you.
          
          INT. KITCHEN. MORNING
          
          David sits while Juliet talks. She is now seated behind him.
          
          JULIET
          I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are 
          now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you 
          become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked 
          after you.
          
          INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Alex sits nervously while the Editor sits on the side of his 
          desk.
          
          EDITOR
          Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond 
          recognition.
          
          ALEX
          I don't know anything about it.
          
          EDITOR
          Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything 
          about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
          
          ALEX
          Cover it?
          
          EDITOR
          Well?
          
          ALEX
          But there's no --
          
          EDITOR
          Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, 
          we're short.
          
          ALEX
          I don't know.
          
          EDITOR
          Don't know what?
          
          ALEX
          Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that 
          is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, 
          it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
          
          INT. KITCHEN. DAY
          
          David and Juliet are seated as before.
          
          DAVID
          I'm sorry.
          
          JULIET
          I should hope so.
          
          david turns towards her. He reaches out and softly touches her 
          face.
          
          DAVID
          Maybe we can still sort everything out.
          
          Juliet takes his hand.
          
          JULIET
          We can try.
          
          They look at one another.
          
          EXT. FOREST. DAY
          
          Several police and unmarked vehicles, including one mobile 
          incident room', stand on a rough track. Another car arrives at 
          the end and is parkeed to one side. Alex steps out.
          
          From where he stands, Alex can see towards the site of the 
          burials. There are a few policemen, uniformed and plain-clothes, 
          and a small knot of journalists, kept at bay by plastic tape 
          draped from tree to tree. Mounds of earth mark the site of the 
          exhumations.
          
          Alex walks past the other journalists into the woods. He looks 
          back towards the sight, then turns to look in the opposite 
          direction. He finds himself at the edge of a golf course. From 
          the green to the graves is hardly any distance.
          
          To one side, Alex sees McCall and Mitchell, hunched in earnest 
          discussion. Mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches Alex's eye.
          
          BINT. KITCHEN/HALL. DAY
          
          The kitchen is empty. We track through the kitchen and out into 
          the hall, stopping at the door to Juliet's room.
          
          INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
          
          David and Juliet are seated on the bed. Among the junk on her 
          bedside table is the Polaroid photograph of Alex, propped up 
          against a tumbler. Juliet reaches out and turns it away before 
          pulling David towards her.
          
          INT. MOBILE INCIDENT ROOM. DAY
          
          Several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs. Alex 
          sits at the back, near the half-open door. At the other end, 
          three police officers face them. They are a medium-ranking 
          Uniformed Officer, and to one side of him Mitchell and then 
          McCall, both of whom sit in silence.
          
          UNIFORMED OFFICER
          All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy 
          facts of the day so far are as follows. Late yesterdat afternoon, 
          forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a 
          grave which appeared to have been recently dug. Further 
          excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves, 
          again containing human remains.
          
          Alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial 
          site, now enclosed in a plastic tent. He continues to stare at 
          it.
          
          While Alex is looking, the sound of laughter and Uniformed 
          Officer's subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory 
          of a sound in Alex's head: it is the noise of the saw going back 
          and forth across the victim's limbs.
          
          UNIFORMED OFFICER
          (CONTINUED)
          As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to 
          ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as 
          identification, which will of course be passed on to you after 
          informing, where possible, the next of kin.
          
          Alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van.
          
          EXT. FOREST. DAY
          
          Alex walks away from the incident room towards his car. He breaks 
          into a run for a few paces.
          
          The noise of the sawing continues.
          
          As he reaches his car, Alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys. 
          He is sweating and trembling. He drops his keys. As he bends down 
          to pick them up, his foot slips on the wet grass. He falls to his 
          knees, his forehead banging against the car door. He kneels for a 
          moment, gripping the keys, his head resting against the door.
          
          The noise of the sawing stops.
          
          From behind, the arm of a Police Constable reaches out and his 
          hand rests on Alex's shoulder.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          A dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room.
          A slide projector dimly lights MR. FULLER, a crew-cutted
          Robert Stack type in a suit, as he addresses the group. The
          current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry
          figure - it could be any of about a billion people.
          
                              FULLER
                    ...So, let's keep a steely eye out
                    for this bastard. (THEN) Before we
                    dismiss, this is your monthly
                    reminder of why we're here.
          
          Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag. Close on
          one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties.
          He politely pays close attention to the presentation.
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    The American people want to travel.
                    (Slide: Family in front of a fake
                    dinosaur) They want to attend
                    baseball contests (Slide: Fat guys
                    spilling beers as they go for a
                    foul ball) and popular music
                    concerts. (Slide: John Tesh)
          
          Close on another face in the group. A doughy man with three-
          day scruff and a trendily long haircut. He looks bored,
          rolling his eyes at the speech.
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    They want to be happy. (Slide: People
                    line dancing) But, Security comes
                    first. (Slide: Army soldier with a
                    massive machine gun guards a play-
                    ground) Without security there can be
                    no happy. You are America's front
                    line in the global war on terror.
                    Let's hit the trenches and let's be
                    careful out there. (Slide: TSA logo)
          
          The lights come up and as the group files out we get a better
          look at their uniforms. The TSA agents move out into the...
          
          INT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY
          
          The agents take their places, manning the screening
          equipment. We push in on the bald man as he takes up his
          post next to the walk-through metal detector. This is KIRK
          KETTNER. He is not a looker. His uniform only serves to
          highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and
          demeanor are pleasant and kind.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
          The scruffy agent is STAINER. He stands at the x-ray
          monitor. As the bags begin to move through, he does not pay
          any attention, rather he hands Kirk a flyer.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Kirk, bro.     Tonight?
          
          INSERT: The flyer reads, "Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to
          Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night!" Stainer is
          pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo.
          
                              KIRK
                    I don't know, Stainer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, you never come see us
                    anymore. It's been like four
                    months. Time to forget about
                    Marnie and get back on the whores.
          
          Stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable.
          Fuller shoots a stern look from his office.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's not that. It's my Grandma.
                    I'll probably be at the hospital
                    for the next few nights.
          
                               STAINER
                    Oh, shit. I spaced that.   How's
                    she doing?
          
                              KIRK
                    She's hanging in there but it
                    doesn't look good.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, I'm sorry. She's a great
                    lady. That sucks.
          
          A Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line. Mr.
          Fuller appears behind Kirk, taps his shoulder and subtly
          motions to the Arab. Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey there, Habib.

                    flagged for a random search.
          
                                                                   3.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, sorry. I'll get you out of
                    here quick. You off to Boston again?

          Kirk opens Habib's bag.
          
                              HABIB (CONT'D)
                    Kirk, I know you're just doing your
                    job but, for Pete's sake, ya'll
                    know me.
          
                                 KIRK
                    I'm sorry.     It's just...
          
          Kirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Okay, Habib, you're all set buddy.
                    Have a good trip.
          
                              HABIB
                    Thanks Kirk. See you next time.
          
          Fuller again appears behind Kirk.
          
                              HABIB (CONT'D)

                              FULLER
                    You think that's funny!? You wanna
                    sit in first class or you wanna sit
                    on my gloved and jellied finger!?
          
          EXT. AIRPORT CURB - DAY
          
          Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the woman's heels
          click along the sidewalk, suitcase rolling behind. Although
          we can't see the woman riding on these legs, we can see
          several men stare as she passes by on her way into...
          
          INT. AIRPORT TICKETING
          
          More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow
          the legs to the check-in line. The legs glide to the front
          and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent.
          
                                                                     4.
          
          
          
          From the slightly upward angle, we see two young male ticket
          agents. (One on each side of the legs.) One is black and one
          white; each are dealing with customers. They simultaneously
          notice our woman. They suspiciously eye one another and the
          race is on. Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite
          their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next.
          
          Angle on the WHITE AGENT as he waits on a yuppie couple.
          
                              WHITE AGENT
                        (RUSHED)
                    Okay, how many bags are you
                    checking? Any bags!?
          
                              YUPPIE MAN
                    Is this one too big to carry on?
          
                                WHITE AGENT
                    No.    Carry it on. Good call.
          
                              YUPPIE WOMAN
                    Grant, you don't want to lug that
                    thing all over the airport.
          
          The agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh. He looks to
          his right to check the progress of the BLACK AGENT, who is
          waiting on an old Asian woman.
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                        (RUSHED)
                    Did you pack your bags yourself?
          
          The Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the
          question but she smiles and nods along.
          
                                ASIAN WOMAN
                    Yes.
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                    Has anyone unknown to you asked you
                    to carry anything onto your flight?
          
          More smiles and blank nods.
          
                                ASIAN WOMAN
                    Yes.
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                    I think you mean NO.
          
                              WHITE AGENT
                    You can't do that!
          
                                                                     5.
          
          
          
                              BLACK AGENT
                    She doesn't know what the hell I'm
                    talking about!
          
                              YUPPIE MAN
                    Where exactly is gate F5?
          
                              WHITE AGENT
                    Just past F4. Have a day now
                    folks. Let's hustle it up.
          
                                 ASIAN WOMAN
                    Sank you!
          
                                 BLACK AGENT
                    No sweat.     Keep it moving.
          
          The Asian woman is not going anywhere. The black agent leans
          into her face and barks once like a dog. Her smile turns to
          fear as she backs away, ending the race in a dead tie.
          
                                 BOTH AGENTS
                    Next!
          
          Reverse to show the woman they were competing for. She is a
          classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. Drop dead
          beautiful. She is startled by the sudden call from both men.
          She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the
          black agent. He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co-
          worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hi, I'm booked on flight 94 to

                    travel quite a bit?
          
          The white agent moves to loiter around the black agent's
          station, just to get a better look at MOLLY.
          
                              WHITE AGENT

          Stainer works the next x-ray belt, where a young rocker type

          moves it back to get a better look.

                                STAINER
                    Fuck you.    No way.
          
          The rocker boy looks at his watch as Stainer rolls the case
          through and pops it open.
          
                              ROCKER
                    Dude, I'm late for my flight.
          
                              STAINER
                    Sorry, I have to search this case
                    for, you know, explosives and such.
                    This thing is sweet!
          
          Stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the
          bins and bags pile up before him.
          
          At Kirk's station, Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing
          through. Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but
          Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else. No flirting
          or stammering - just friendly and relaxed.
          
                                KIRK
                    Morning.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, hello again.
          
                              KIRK
                    Second trip in two days?
          
          Molly is putting her laptop back in her bag.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop
                    to L.A. but they've got me going
                    back and forth three days in a row.
                    This client is killing me.
          
                              KIRK
                    Well hang in there kiddo and I
                    guess I'll see you tomorrow.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    It's a date.
          
          Molly's long legs carry her toward the gates as every man
          except Kirk watches. Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk.
          
                              FULLER
                    Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever
                    like to...you know...put my penis
                    in her vagina. (wink)
          
          Back at Stainer's station. As he puts the guitar back in its
          case, he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine.
          Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes.
          
                              ROCKER
                    What the hell!?
          
          He grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, I am so sorry.
          
                              ROCKER
                    Sorry my ass! This thing is worth
                    more than you make in a year, you
                    clumsy motherfucker!
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, I bet it was but...
          
          Stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    "TSA is not responsible for items
                    lost or damaged in the security
                    screening process..."
          
          Stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand-
          written on the back. He reads them aloud.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    "...so fuck you."
          
          INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kirk enters to find his MOTHER, an attractive old woman,
          sitting with a short, plain woman about Kirk's age.
          
                               KIRK
                    Hey Mom.   Hey Marnie.
          
                                                                    8.
          
          
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    Oh, hi Sweetie.
          
          Across the room, Kirk's father is speaking to a man who looks
          a bit like Kirk. The man is telling a funny story that
          cracks up MR. KETTNER. The two pretend to box for a moment.
          
                              KIRK
                    Who's that guy Dad's with?
          
          MARNIE (the plain woman) stands and takes Kirk aside.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Kirk, you've been really great about
                    your mom and I staying so close
                    since we broke up but I know how
                    much Grammy meant to you... Well, is
                    it okay with you that I'm here?
          
                               KIRK
                    Sure.   It's fine.   (it's not)
          
                              MARNIE
                    Okay, good. Then can I introduce
                    you to my new boyfriend?
          
          She leads Kirk over to the man who is speaking with his
          father. They are laughing again.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    Ron, this is Kirk.
          
                              RON
                    Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! (Ron
                    and Mr. Kettner laugh) No! I'm
                    just jack-assin' with you, pirate.
                    Great to meet you. How you doing?
          
                              KIRK
                    I've been better.
          
                              RON
                    Right. Of course. I'm sorry about
                    your grandmother. It's just so...
                    Well, old people, you know, what
                    are you gonna do?
          
                               KIRK
                    Yeah.   Thanks.
          
          Kirk's brother ERIC and his fiance DEBBIE enter from the
          hall. They are both in their late thirties and good-looking
          for trailer trash. Debbie is about seven months pregnant.
          
                                                                   9.
          
          
          
                              ERIC
                    Little brother.   Grammy wants to
                    see you.
          
                               KIRK
                    Okay.   Well, I better get in there.
          
          Eric and Debbie walk with Kirk down the hall.
          
                              ERIC
                    Listen, I'm pretty sure she wants
                    to discuss the will. She won't
                    tell us dick, so we're kind of
                    hoping you can grease the wheels.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, but you know Grammy didn't
                    have all that much. Once the
                    hospital and... and the ah...
          
                              ERIC
                    Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what
                    not...
          
                              KIRK
                    Well, it's not going to leave
                    enough to get worked up over.
          
                              DEBBIE
                    We've got a wedding to pay for,
                    Kirk and...
          
                              ERIC
                    Debbie, let me handle this. We've
                    got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts,
                    and you know Mom and Dad are going
                    to Branson next month. Now you
                    always been Grammy's favorite so
                    we're counting on you to get in
                    there and sort out what's what.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - GRAMMY'S ROOM
          
          In a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed.
          She is hooked up to an I.V. and several monitors. Kirk comes
          in and forces a smile. Grammy's voice is weak and shaky.
          
                               GRAMMY
                    There you are Big Slick.   Did you
                    bring 'em?
          
                              KIRK
                    Grammy, you really shouldn't...
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
          
                              GRAMMY
                    Just hand 'em over. I'm on death's
                    door and you know it.
          
          Kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Christ's sake. Filters?
          
          Grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag. Kirk tears
          up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life.
          
                              KIRK
                    I love you Grammy.
          
                              GRAMMY
                    Don't start that shit now. You're
                    looking at one lucky old broad who's
                    done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby,
                    colored fellas. I got no complaints.
                    So when the check comes I don't want
                    any blubbering or bullshit outta
                    you. Just enjoy your life like I
                    did mine and raise a glass to your
                    old Grammy once in a while.
          
          Kirk hugs her and he cries a bit.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    You know how much I love you Kirk.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Molly is coming through Kirk's lane again. Mr. Fuller steps
          in and stops her before she crosses through.
          
                              FULLER
                    Ma'am, could you please remove your
                    jacket and shoes?
          
                                MOLLY
                    Oh, sure.
          
          She does. Fuller is leering at her stellar body.   She's
          about to go through when he stops her again.
          
                              FULLER
                    Why don't we go ahead and strip off
                    that belt too while we're at it.
          
          Molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt.
          She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a
          raised palm. He then motions to her breasts and crotch.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    Any piercings you'd like me to know
                    about?
          
                              KIRK
                    Why don't you just come on through,
                    ma'am, and we'll see if anything
                    sets off the machine.
          
          Molly steps through. The machine does not go off. She
          gathers her things and mouths a silent, "Thank You" to Kirk
          as she walks on. Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say
          anything, RANDY, a young agent, calls out from the office.
          
                              RANDY
                    Kirk buddy! Phone call!
          
          Kirk walks over to take the call.
          
                              FULLER
                    You best hope the terrorists are
                    taking personal calls on the job
                    too, mister!
          
          Kirk takes the phone from Randy.
          
                              KIRK
                    This is Kirk Kettner.
          
          Kirk's expression tells us that some sad news is coming in.
          
          INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
          
          Kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee. He opens his
          wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an
          eight-year-old Kirk in a casino. Grammy is smoking a
          cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table.
          
          Kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands.
          
          Molly is passing.   She sees Kirk and stops.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh Geeze. Please tell me I didn't
                    get you in trouble back there.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, no. It's not that.    I ah...I
                    lost somebody today.
          
          Molly sits down and puts her hand on his hand.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I
                    know... I lost my grandmother a
                    few months ago and I...
          
          Kirk tears up again and so does Molly.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Your grandmother too? And you were
                    close? Oh, you poor thing.
          
          Kirk tries to keep it together.   Molly looks at the photo.
          
                              KIRK
                    She used to be a blackjack dealer
                    at the Horseshoe. When I was
                    little, she taught me and my
                    friends how to play poker. Turned
                    us into a bunch of eight-year-old
                    degenerate gamblers.
          
          They share a sad laugh.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    So, your grandmother too, huh?
          
          Molly removes a small clear-plastic booklet of photos from
          her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother.
          
                              MOLLY
                    My Grammy Keenan was ninety four
                    but independent right to the end.
                    She was always trying to cook for
                    everyone. You couldn't stop her.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, God, I know. Grammy used to
                    change her own oil. Right up until
                    a few months ago. She was... Do
                    you change your own oil?
          
                              MOLLY
                        (LAUGHS)
                    No. I wouldn't know where to begin.
          
                              KIRK
                    I know, me neither. She could
                    barley walk and I'd come over and
                    find her lying under her Cadillac
                    all covered in grease.
          
          They share a laugh and Kirk is cheering up a bit.   An
          announcement comes over the PA.
          
                                                                   13.
          
          
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    ...final boarding call for United
                    flight 94 to Burbank...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, geeze, that's me. I'm so sorry.
          
                               KIRK
                    No, no.   Go catch your flight.
          
          Molly stands and offers her hand to Kirk.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    I'm Molly.
          
                              KIRK
                    Kirk Kettner.
          
          Molly squeezes Kirk's hand, grabs her bags and trots off
          toward her gate. A businessman near Kirk's table reaches
          over and gives him a playful chuck on the shoulder.
          
                              BUSINESSMAN
                    Dead Grandma. (a nod and a cheek
                    click) Nice one.
          
          INT. AIRPORT GATE
          
          Molly arrives at the gate just in time to make her flight.
          
          INT. AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP
          
          Kirk gathers his things and notices that Molly left her
          pictures on the table. He looks through them. In the last
          pouch are some business cards that read, "Molly McCall -
          Event Planner." Her cell number is on the card.
          
          INT. AIRPLANE 737
          
          Molly is sitting in a window seat. The flight is mostly
          empty. The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a
          CREEPY BUSINESSMAN moves from the row behind her to the seat
          next to Molly. He casually smiles as though there is nothing
          odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and
          many full rows) are open. Molly looks at the vacant seats
          and then at him as if to say, "You've got to be kidding."
          
                              CREEPY BUSINESSMAN
                    How you doin'?
          
          Molly's phone rings and she fumbles to answer it.   A FEMALE
          PASSENGER sitting two rows back looks annoyed.
          
                                                                     14.

                                MOLLY
                    Hello?
          
                               KIRK
                    Oh, hi.   Molly McCall?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Who's calling please?
          
                              KIRK
                    It's Kirk... From the coffee shop.
                    You left your pictures with me. If
                    you tell me which gate you're at, I
                    can run them right down to you.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, no. I'm already on the plane
                    and we're pushing back right now.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, well I'll leave them at the
                    lost and found and when you get...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh geeze, some of those are my only
                    prints. It would be such a huge
                    favor if you could hold on to them
                    for me. I'm coming back next week.
          
                                KIRK
                    Oh, sure.    But how will I...
          
          The female passenger hails the flight attendant.
          
                              FEMALE PASSENGER
                    She's talking on her phone.
          
          The creepy businessman gives the woman the finger and then
          looks to Molly for approval. He doesn't get it.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I have your number in my phone. As
                    soon as I get back I'll call you
                    and arrange to pick them up, okay?
                    Thank you so much, Kirk.
          
          Molly turns off her phone and holds it up for the flight
          attendant to see.
          
                               MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.   I'm really sorry.
          
                                                                     15.

                    You believe these pricks? So, what
                    do you do?
          
                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. VERTIGO CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Kirk comes in and stops at the bar to order a beer. Two men
          are waving to him from a table near the stage. Kirk gets his
          bottle and snakes through the crowd toward his friends.
          
          On stage, Stainer (in his afro wig) plays guitar as his band
          finishes the last chorus of "Lovin', Touchin' Squeezin'."
          
                              STAINER
                    Thank you! We're going to take a
                    little breakski but we'll be back
                    in a few minutes to do Frontiers.
          
          The band turns to put down their instruments and the house
          music kicks in.
          
          Kirk arrives where his friends are standing at a high bar
          table. DEVON looks like Howdy Doody at 33. JACK is good-
          looking and dressed semi-hipster. Devon gives Kirk a hug.
          
                                DEVON
                    Hey Kirk.    How you been holdin' up?
          
                              KIRK
                    It's been a rough week but, you
                    know, all of the services and
                    family stuff keep you pretty
                    busy... I really miss her, though.
          
          Jack hugs Kirk as well.
          
                              JACK
                    She sounded like a hell of a lady.
          
                              STAINER (O.S.)
                    Oh, fuck yeah! Kirk's Grandma was
                    the shit.
          
          Stainer arrives, hugs Kirk and gives him a kiss on the head.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    She's with God now, buddy - and you
                    just know she's bustin' his balls.
          
          Kirk laughs and Stainer raises his glass.
          
                                                                      16.

                    To Stella!
          
          The guys all raise their glasses and take a drink.     This is
          just what Grammy wanted and it's cheering Kirk up.
          
          Kirk's cell phone rings.      He has to talk loud over the music.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hello?... Oh, Hi. I'm sorry I can
                    barely hear you. I'm at a club
                    and.... Club Vertigo? Oh, yeah -
                    it's right down the street from
                    there... Okay, sounds good.
          
          Kirk hangs up.
          
                              JACK
                    What was that all about?
          
                              KIRK
                    Nothing, just a passenger. She
                    accidentally left something with
                    me. She's going to stop in and
                    pick it up I guess.
          
                              DEVON
                    She's coming here?      She a cute gal?
          
                                 KIRK
                    Very.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well alright dude! That's a leave-
                    behind. She digs you!
          
                              KIRK
                    No she doesn't.      Trust me.
          
                              STAINER
                    She does a leave behind and then
                    just happens to be in the
                    neighborhood? She practically has
                    her hands in your pants.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, seriously - it's nothing.      She's
                    way out of my league.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, you said Marnie was out of
                    your league and let's face it,
                    Marnie's kinda nasty.
          
                                                                     17.
          
          
          
          Marnie is standing behind Stainer.     He doesn't miss a beat.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    ...Marnie...don't you think Marnie
                    Tomkins is kind of nasty?
          
                              MARNIE
                    I don't know who that is.
          
                              STAINER
                    Oh, you don't know Marnie Tomkins?
                    She's just this girl. I thought you
                    knew her. Anyway, she's pretty nasty
                    looking... but you're looking good.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Kirk, I'm sorry about Grammy.
          
          The guys slink away to give Kirk and Marnie some privacy.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    I realize she was never that crazy
                    about me but I know how much you
                    loved her and I hope you're okay.
          
                               KIRK
                    Thanks.   Thanks, I'll be alright.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Listen, are you going to Branson
                    with your folks next month?
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   It's not really my thing.
          
                              MARNIE
                    What's wrong with Branson?     You too
                    good for Branson now?
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   Branson's...awesome.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Well, your mom invited Ron and I
                    along. We'd love to go but not if
                    it's going to be weird for you.
          
          Kirk considers this.   It will be weird.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    ...I mean the tickets are non-
                    refundable but it's up to you.
          
                                                                  18.
          
          
          
          Stainer overhears this and groans out loud.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. You should go. I'm sure
                    you'll have a great time. Totally.
          
          Marnie hugs Kirk.   This makes him uncomfortable.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Kirk, I'm sorry about what happened
                    with us. You're going to make
                    someone very happy someday, but you
                    have to get over me first, okay?
                    Is it a deal?
          
          Marnie hugs him again and then departs.
          
                              STAINER
                    She's going to Branson with your
                    fucking parents? And bringing her
                    new fucking boyfriend!?
          
                             KIRK
                    Yeah. He seems like a good guy,
                    though.  He's an entrepreneur.
          
          Across the room they see Marnie return to Ron with a hug.
          
                              JACK
                    Entrepreneur? Kirk, I know that
                    guy. He owns a Pizza Hut.
          
                               KIRK
                    So?   That's a business.
          
                              STAINER
                    It's not even a real Pizza Hut.
                    It's one of those strip-mall take-
                    out ones. They don't even have
                    chicken wings. The guy's a fuckin'
                    douche bag.
          
                              KIRK
                    He's got more going on than I do.
                    That's all I'm saying.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, you can do a hell of a lot
                    better than her.
          
                              DEVON
                    One door closes, another door opens.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    Fuck you Devon, that doesn't even
                    make any sense. But take this
                    broad that's coming here tonight -
                    I got a feeling about her. You're
                    gonna get on that.
          
                              JACK
                    Absolutely. Visualize it.
          
                              KIRK
                    I appreciate what you guys are
                    trying to do but, I'm telling you,
                    I have zero chance with this one
                    and I'm completely okay with that.
          
                              DEVON
                    That's defeatist thinking.
          
                              KIRK
                    No it isn't. It's just like saying
                    I'll never go to the moon and I'm
                    okay with that too.
          
                              STAINER
                    You're saying you don't want to go
                    to the moon? That's bullshit.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. I'm saying that I never will
                    go to the moon but I'm not going to
                    get down about it because, you know
                    - I never expected to.
          
                              STAINER
                    You don't know. Technology and
                    shit. You might go to the moon.
          
          Kirk waves to someone at the door.   The guys look up.
          
          The guys' POV: Molly is stepping toward them - dressed in a
          beautiful gown. They laugh the way you might laugh at a
          particularly brutal football tackle.
          
                              DEVON
                    Holy Frijole.
          
                               JACK
                    Oh shit.   Yeah, you're right.
          
                              STAINER
                    Sorry, bro. You'll go to the moon
                    before you'll hit that. No chance.
          
                                                                     20.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    I told you.
          
          Molly arrives at their table.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    Hey!     There you are!
          
          Molly hugs Kirk.    From across the bar, Marnie takes notice.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Here I am.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'm sorry I'm so overdressed. I
                    just came from a work thing. Are
                    you doing okay with...everything?
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, you know... Hey, these are my
                    best friends - Jack, Devon and
                    Stainer.
          
          The guys' I.Q.s drop like stones as they shake her hand.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    Stainer?
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, just a nickname.    Doesn't
                    really mean nothin'.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh. Here's your pictures - all
                    safe and sound.
          
          Kirk hands Molly the pictures.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Thank you so much for taking care of
                    them for me! I need to get some
                    copies made. If I lost these...uugh.
          
                              KIRK
                    No trouble at all.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hey, have you eaten yet?
          
                                 KIRK
                    Um...
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    I was going to go grab a bite. Let
                    me buy you dinner to pay you back.
          
                              KIRK
                    You don't have to pay me back.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I know. I want to. Come on! The
                    place across the street has the
                    best greasy burgers in town.
          
                              KIRK
                    A burger does sound good. (then to
                    the guys) I'm going to just ah...
          
          Molly waves goodbye and heads for the door. Kirk starts to
          follow but Stainer pulls him back for a quick huddle.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude. It's cool that she's buying
                    you dinner but do not get your
                    hopes up about this one.
          
                              KIRK
                    Don't worry. Believe me, I know.
          
          Kirk catches up with Molly.   Marnie watches them exit.
          
          A big guy has overheard this and leans over to Stainer.
          
                              BIG GUY
                    Good advice there friend. Your boy
                    ain't got a prayer with that chick.
          
                              STAINER
                    You talking shit about my buddy!?
                    'Cause I'm giving out free fuckin'
                    ambulance rides!
          
          Big Guy assesses the crazy on Stainer's face and stands down.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, I didn't think so!
          
          INT. BURGER JOINT - NIGHT
          
          Kirk and Molly sit across from one another in a booth.    The
          WAITER arrives.
          
                              WAITER
                    Start you off with something to
                    drink ma'am?
          
                                                                 22.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'll have a Bass.
          
                              WAITER
                    And for your... brother?
          
                                 KIRK
                    What?     Oh, I'm not her brother.
          
                              WAITER
                    Oh, I'm sorry. I just figured...
          
                              KIRK
                    You know what, a Bass sounds good.
                    Make that two.
          
                                WAITER
                    Great.    Sorry.
          
          The waiter exits.
          
                              KIRK
                    So... You know what I do, what
                    about you? Your card said event
                    planner. How'd you get into that?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Well, it wasn't the original plan.
                    I went to law school. Ended up at
                    a big firm but I hated it. Then,
                    they asked me to plan the Christmas
                    party. It was a big hit and a few
                    months later I was done with law.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Wow.
          
                                MOLLY
                    I know.    Pernicious career move,
                    right?
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, I don't know what that word
                    means. What was it?
          
          Close on Molly's smile. She finds Kirk's unabashed admission
          very refreshing and endearing.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    I'm sorry.     Like, destructive or...
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, okay. No, I don't think that's
                    so perni...gious?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Pernicious.
          
                              KIRK
                    Good - new word. No, not pernicious
                    at all. Not if you enjoy the work.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I really do. We do a lot of
                    charity events and I get to work
                    with some of the most amazing human
                    beings on some really fun projects.
                    Next month I'm doing a cancer
                    benefit with Billy Joel.
          
                               KIRK
                    Wow.   I love Billy Joel.
          
                              MOLLY
                    The only downside is I have to do a
                    lot of public speaking and I've
                    always struggled with stage fright.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh man - That's my number one fear.
                    I'm terrified of getting up in
                    front of people. I'd rather get a
                    Kentucky root canal.
          
          Molly laughs. An older GOOD-LOOKING MAN steps up to the
          table and stands facing her with his back to Kirk.
          
                              GOOD-LOOKING MAN
                    Excuse me, I was just sitting over
                    at the bar and I was wondering; has
                    anyone told you today that you are
                    absolutely stunning?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Are you seriously hitting on me
                    right in front of my boyfriend?
          
          He turns to Kirk and both men start to laugh.
          
                              GOOD-LOOKING MAN
                    This is your boyfriend?
          
                                                                   24.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                     Oh, yeah right! (Catches Molly's
                     unspoken instructions.) But, yeah.
                     I'm her boyfriend, I guess, so...
          
                                GOOD-LOOKING MAN
                     Really?   Wow. Well... sorry.
          
                               KIRK
                     Honest mistake.
          
          The man gives Kirk a wink and wanders back to the bar.
          
                               MOLLY
                     Did you get a load of that hair-
                     piece? What is it with men? I
                     mean, look at you. You're bald and
                     you're fine with it. A little
                     dignity is all I'm saying. The
                     toupees and plugs and the teen-
                     dream sports cars... Oh geeze, I'm
                     sorry. Do you drive a sports car?
          
                               KIRK
                     I drive a 94 Taurus. It's got
                     AM/FM but I wouldn't call it a
                     sports car per se.
          
          Molly laughs and we hard cut through the following snippets
          of conversation as they eat, chat and laugh.
          
                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                     So here's this little old lady
                     trying to go through security with
                     six pounds of weed in her girdle!
          
          Cut.   The food is being served.
          
                               MOLLY
                     Oh, my God! I love that book!
          
          Cut.   The waitress is picking up the empty plates.
          
                               KIRK
                     So, a duck walks into a bar...
          
          Cut.   Molly is laughing while she's paying the bill.
          
                               MOLLY
                     Well, I've got an early morning. I
                     should go. Thanks for coming
                     along. This was really fun. And
                     thanks again for helping me out.
          
                                                                        25.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    No, thank you for dinner. I feel
                    bad that you won't let me...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, stop it. Listen, I handle some
                    of the charity events for the
                    Coyotes and I've got some tickets
                    for the hockey game tomorrow night.
                    You interested?
          
          Kirk is a bit taken aback and confused.     Is she actually
          asking him out on a real date?
          
                              KIRK
                        (NERVOUSLY)
                    Um, sure. Yeah, great. I mean,
                    I'm free tomorrow night.
          
          She digs two tickets out of her purse and hands them over.
          
                             MOLLY
                    Perfect. I hate to see them go to
                    waste. There's two so maybe bring
                    Stainer?
          
          Kirk's expression is as much relief as disappointment.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Oh, right.     Thanks!   Thank you.
          
          EXT. HOCKEY ARENA - NIGHT
          
          Kirk and Stainer are on their way through security. A huge
          security guard runs a metal-detector wand over Stainer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Whatcha runnin' there a PX-235?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know sir.
          
                              STAINER
                    The two hundred series are dog
                    shit. You couldn't find a bazooka
                    with that thing. You should look
                    into the new eight fifties.
          
                              GUARD
                    Can you keep it moving sir?
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          
          INT. HOCKEY ARENA
          
          Kirk and Stainer arrive at the third row to find two open
          seats right next to the penalty box. To Kirk's surprise, in
          the next seat - Molly! Kirk elbows Stainer.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey, it's Molly.       She's here.
          
                                 STAINER
                           (PERPLEXED)
                    Huh.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hey guys! You made it! Hooray!
                    Thanks for coming.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Oh, yeah.     Wouldn't miss it.
          
                              STAINER
                    Thanks for the sweet seats!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Guys, this is my best friend in the
                    whole world, Patty. This is Kirk
                    and, um, Stainer, right?
          
          Patty is over 200 pounds with a pretty face and an edge that
          comes from a lifetime of taking crap from morons.
          
                                 PATTY
                    Hey boys.     Nice to meet you.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Patty's my assistant and my go-to
                    gal. Whatever you need, she can
                    make it happen on a moments notice.
          
                              PATTY
                    You need a cock-shaped cake with a
                    cotton-candy bush delivered by four
                    o'clock? I'm your connection.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, and she likes to shock people
                    so don't let her freak you out.
          
                              KIRK
                    How 'bout that. So, we're going to
                    grab some beers. Can we bring you
                    ladies anything? Beer? Nachos?
                    Patty, cotton candy?
          
                                                                 27.
          
          
          
          INT. HOCKEY ARENA CONCESSIONS AREA
          
          Stainer and Kirk stand in the beer line.
          
                              STAINER
                    That's it. She's setting you up
                    with the fat chick.
          
                              KIRK
                    Ooohhh! Okay! Okay! That makes
                    sense, right!? When Molly was here
                    I was like, "what!?" But, okay!
                    Well, Patty seems cool. She's funny.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, yeah, she has to be.
          
                              KIRK
                    What does that mean?
          
                              STAINER
                    Nothing. The fat chick seems
                    great. You never know, bro, that
                    fat chick could wind up being the
                    love of your life.
          
          Kirk returns a look of annoyance.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Patty, I'm saying. Patty could be
                    the love of your life.
          
          INT. HOCKEY ARENA
          
          The game has started. Kirk, Stainer, Molly and Patty are
          cheering. The puck smacks the glass before them and another
          player skates up for it. As he mucks it from the edge, he
          looks up and sees Molly. He's distracted just long enough to
          get brutally checked face first into the glass. A penalty is
          called on the player who hit him. That player skates into
          the penalty box near Molly. The name on his jersey reads,
          "REESE." He speaks with a thick Canadian accent.
          
                                 REESE
                    Hey Molly!     Yer lookin' good, eh!
          
                              MOLLY
                    That was a bogus call, Bobby.    Your
                    skates barely left the ice.
          
                               REESE
                    I know.   What's that aboot, eh?
          
                                                                  28.

                        (nervously to Reese)
                    Yeah, that ref is like a total
                    blindo, man.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Blindo?
          
                              PATTY
                    Kirk, Molly's sister is blind.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
          
                              MOLLY
                        (not offended)
                    Oh, I know. It's fine.
          
          INT. BROADCAST BOOTH

          INT. HOCKEY ARENA
          
                              REESE
                    So, after the game, you wanna party?
          
                              MOLLY
                    You know my policy on players,
                    Bobby. And you might have noticed
                    we've already got dates.
          
          The penalty ends and the ref opens the box but Reese is not
          paying attention.
          
                              REESE
                    Come on, Molly. Just give me a
                    chance, eh.   I'm a great guy - ask
                    any of these assholes.
          
          The crowd is booing Reese.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Reese, you'd better...
          
                              REESE
                    You can't seriously be blowing me
                    off for these two hosers.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    Hey! Fuck you Reese!    You suck
                    this year anyway!
          
          Reese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts
          Stainer.
          
                                STAINER (CONT'D)
                    You dick!
          
          Stainer is immediately on his feet, climbing the glass and
          trying to pummel the huge player. Security is on him in a
          flash and dragging him, kicking & swearing, out of the arena.
          
          Reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late.
          The Sharks score and the crowd revolts. A red-haired redneck
          woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to Molly and company.
          
                              RED-HAIRED WOMAN
                    You idiots just cost us a goal!    I

                    You do NOT want me comin' up there!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Patty! Stop it! I'll go see what
                    I can do about Stainer.

                    No, this is my fault, I'll take
                    care of it.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, it's okay. I know the head of
                    security. I'll be right back.
          
          Molly exits and Patty sits back down next to Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    God, I'm really embarrassed.
          
                              PATTY
                    That's okay, if Reese did that to
                    me I'd have gone over the glass
                    too. But I would have landed a few
                    before they got me. Reese has been
                    all over Molly ever since she
                    dumped her boyfriend. I tell you,
                    that girl has nothing but trouble
                    when it comes to men.
          
                                                   30.
          
          
          
                    KIRK
          What? How is that even possible?
          She's so...
          
                    PATTY
          Tell me about it. I'm no lezbo but
          sometimes she makes me want to
          strap on - if know what I'm saying.
          
                     KIRK
          Yeah.   I think I do.
          
                    PATTY
          It's a curse, looking like that.
          Who has the balls to hit on her?
          Just the most arrogant A-holes like
          Reese out there.
          
                    KIRK
          Yeah, I suppose.
          
                    PATTY
          Listen, Molly brought me along
          tonight because, you know, she
          thought I might be 'interested.'
          
                     KIRK
          Oh.   Oh yeah?
          
                    PATTY
          But, just for honesty's sake, I'm
          not interested. No offense.
          
                    KIRK
          No! Hey! None taken. I don't
          blame you. I know I'm no Brad
          Pitt. That's cool.
          
                    PATTY
          What? You? No, I'm talking about
          your pal, Stainer. I know he's your
          friend but he seems like kind of a
          dumbshit. (THEN) Wait. Why would
          you think I was talking about you?
          
                       KIRK
          I'm sorry.     I didn't mean to assume
          anything.
          
                    PATTY
          Oh my God. You don't have a clue
          do you? Molly's really into you.
          
                                                                   31.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, yeah right!
          
          Kirk laughs hard until he realizes that Patty isn't laughing.
          Patty's nod says, "I'm serious."
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    But... why would...
          
                              PATTY
                    A knockout like Molly be interested
                    in a spud like you?
          
                              KIRK
                    Well, yeah.
          
                              PATTY
                    Got me. Again, no offense. But
                    listen, Kirk, your dream girl just
                    showed up. Try not to blow it.
          
          Close on Kirk's terrified expression.   The SOUND of a bowling
          ball demolishing ten pins...
          
          INT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT
          
          The place is crowded and classic rock is cranking. It's an
          old alley with overhead-projection score sheets. Kirk,
          Stainer and Devon sit and talk while Jack throws a strike.
          
                              DEVON
                    Atta boy Jackers!
          
                              STAINER
                    It doesn't add up, Kirk. If
                    Molly's so into you, why bring her
                    friend and give you two tickets?
          
                              KIRK
                    She was hoping to set Patty up with
                    you.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Oh, great.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's okay, she wasn't interested.
          
                              STAINER
                    So you're saying the hottest babe
                    in the world wants you and the fat
                    chick isn't into me. Will you
                    listen to yourself? Fuck you.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  32.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    What did Molly have to say about
                    all this?
          
                              KIRK
                    I don't know, Stainer, somebody got
                    thrown out of the game and I had to
                    drive him home, remember?
          
                              DEVON
                    Pretty impressive catch, Kirky.
          
                              STAINER
                    There's no way. Don't get him all
                    worked up. Her friend was fuckin'
                    with him. Molly said herself that
                    Patty loves to mess with people.
          
                              DEVON
                    Kirk, you deserve a gal like her.
                    And Stainer, why don't you try to
                    be a little more supportive.
          
                              STAINER
                    Why don't you try a little shut the
                    fuck up, Devon. This week, we're
                    not taking dating tips from the guy
                    who met his wife in eighth grade.
          
                              JACK
                    Are we still bowling?
          
          Stainer picks up a crappy, beat up ball from the ball return.
          
                              STAINER
                    All I'm saying is - she's just too
                    hot. No judgement on Kirky, the
                    guy's just outgunned here.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can't argue with him.
          
          Stainer goes to the line. The BOWLER (a pro-type with a
          custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing
          about to roll. Stainer starts to step up.
          
                              BOWLER
                    Yo, house ball! I was up first.
          
                              STAINER
                    Oh for fucks... What is it with you
                    people?
          
                              BOWLER
                    Just wait your turn.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    All this noise and bullshit in this
                    place and I'm such a distraction
                    over here in your god damned
                    peripheral vision!?
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay Stains, take it easy.
          
          The bowler stands glaring back.
          
                               STAINER
                    Well!?   Fuckin' roll then!
          
          The bowler takes another minute to set. Stainer lets out a
          long sigh. The bowler steps to the line and Stainer rushes
          into his own delivery. Both men throw gutters. The bowler
          comes at Stainer but their friends separate them.
          
                              BOWLER
                    You're lucky motherfucker!
          
                                STAINER
                    Oh yeah!?    Bring it, Brunswick!
          
                                DEVON
                    Stainer!    Cool your jets, buster.
          
          The bowler's friends drag him away. Stainer takes a deep
          breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode.
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay. Anyway... I love Kirky but
                    let's face it, the guy's a three.
          
                              DEVON
                    Stainer, that's just dirty pool.
                    He's at least a four.
          
                              STAINER
                    You're outta your fuckin' mind -
                    four! You go ahead and pump
                    rainbows up his ass. I'm just
                    being honest.
          
          Stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the
          glass. It projects onto the overhead scoreboard.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can live with three.
          
                                                             34.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    He's a nice guy and he's funny.
                    Those are a half a point each.
          
          Stainer continues the equation on the projector.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    But he drives a shit box so we
                    gotta deduct a point for that.
          
                              DEVON
                    Kirk said she likes his Taurus.
          
                              STAINER
                    That's so fucked, I won't even
                    dignify it with a response. So
                    we're back to three. Meanwhile,
                    this Molly is a hard ten.
          
                              DEVON
                    A hard ten?
          
                               STAINER
                    Generally, if a broad is that hot
                    you can deduct a few points for dumb
                    or shallow but she went to law
                    school and her sister's blind.
                    That's a hard ten, friends, and that
                    is rare. A seven point disparity -
                    that's a chasm. The most you can
                    jump is two points. I can't even
                    get a ten.
          
                              JACK
                    Oh, not even you, huh?
          
                              STAINER
                    I'm a five, okay?
          
                                JACK
                    Bullshit.    Then what am I?
          
                              STAINER
                    You're a seven and a half.
          
                              JACK
                    Fine, you're a five then.
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay, so I get a two point bump for
                    being in a band. That puts me at
                    seven. On a good day, most I can
                    bag is a niner.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    What about your shitty car?
          
                              STAINER
                    Artist exemption. I'm expected to
                    have a shitty car.
          
                              JACK
                    Is there an artist exemption for
                    being a jag-off?
          
                              STAINER
                    Fuckin' A there is.
          
                              KIRK
                    Stainer's right. Patty was
                    probably just messing around. It's
                    not a big deal. Let's just bowl.
          
                              DEVON
                    What about Rick Ocasek?   Billy
                    Joel, Donald Trump...
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, dumbass. Those are the wild-
                    cards. Money and fame.
          
                              JACK
                    So, if he were a millionaire?
          
                              STAINER
                    A mil ain't what it once was,
                    Jackie. Devon's practically a
                    millionaire for Christ sake. A mil
                    might get you an eight but to bring
                    down a ten now days - two million
                    minimum.
          
          Stainer finishes the equation by writing, "Kirk = Fucked."
          Kirk's phone rings. He checks the ID and his eyes go wide.
          
                              KIRK
                        (into the phone)
                    Hey, Molly... Um, yeah, sure...
                    No, that sounds good. Yeah, I know
                    where that is. Um, okay, yeah...
                    see you then.
          
          Kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends, who wait in suspense.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Holy crap. (dazed pause) She just
                    asked me out for tomorrow night!
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
          
          Kirk exchanges fives, fists, tips and hugs with Devon and
          Jack. Stainer shakes his head, still not buying it.
          
          INT. BOWLING ALLEY MEN'S ROOM
          
          Kirk runs into the otherwise empty restroom. He stares into
          the mirror and his smile fades into panic. He splashes water
          on his face. He reaches for a paper towel but the dispenser
          is empty.
          
                              KIRK
                        (to himself)
                    It's okay. Get it together. Guys
                    do this all the time. You can do
                    this. You can make it happen.
          
                              RANDOM MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        (from inside a stall)
                    You better not be jerking off in
                    the sink, man!
          
          EXT. AIRPORT PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kirk's Taurus pulls into a space. He climbs out and slams
          the door. As it closes, he reaches but too late. He looks
          through the window. The keys are hanging in the ignition.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
          
          WILLY, the Russian driver, is chipper and bubbly as he sings
          along with "I'm Like a Bird" on the radio. Kirk is knocked
          around by Willy's crazy driving. In the mirror, Willy
          notices Kirk's dazed expression.
          
                              WILLY
                        (thick accent)
                    Kirk! You look like someone made a
                    second number in your breakfast
                    cereal. You are doing okay, yes?
          
                              KIRK
                    You know what Willy. I honestly
                    don't know how I'm doing.
          
                              WILLY
                    He does not know!
          
                              KIRK
                    I should be doing awesome but I
                    don't know. Know what I mean?
          
                              WILLY
                    Nope!
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    How are you?
          
                              WILLY
                    Perfect! Willy is having another
                    kick ass of a day.
          
          Willy takes a hard left and some suitcases fall on Kirk.
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT - DAY
          
          Kirk is picking up a coffee. As he walks on, he takes a sip.
          The lid comes off and hot coffee spills on his shirt.
          
                              STAINER (O.S.)
                    Way to go, Big Slick.
          
          Stainer is now next to Kirk, who glares back at him as they
          walk across the food court.
          
          A short, plain girl behind the Orange Julius counter gives
          them an apprehensive wave.
          
                                STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Oh, shit.    Let's go this way.
          
          Stainer returns an uncomfortable smile but then redirects
          their path away from her. Kirk waves.
          
                              KIRK
                    Who's that?
          
                              STAINER
                    Nobody. Just some chick I boned
                    once when I was drunk. You look
                    like shit, bro.
          
                              KIRK
                    Thanks. I had trouble sleeping
                    last night. This Molly thing... I
                    don't want to want this, you know?
                    It just seems too good to be true.
                    I just don't get it.
          
                              STAINER
                    I know what you mean.   There has to
                    be some explanation.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can't think of one.   Not one that
                    makes any sense.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, let's spitball it a little.
                    You've got dick for money so she's
                    no gold digger. Oohh! Did you
                    ever see Double Indemnity?
          
                              KIRK
                    Please don't say she wants me to
                    kill someone.
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay, then... maybe she's on a
                    scavenger hunt. You know, like
                    find a wagon wheel, a wiffle ball
                    bat and a fat, bald TSA agent -
                    that kind of thing.
          
          Kirk is no longer responding.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Oh, shit, dude. Al Qaeda. Think
                    about it. You're a TSA agent,
                    she's a terrorist...
          
          Kirk walks away.
          
          EXT. OLD STRIP MALL - DAY
          
          Kirk, still in his TSA uniform, walks past a large laundromat
          to a small storefront next door. The chipped and faded
          lettering on the glass reads, "Maury Hammerstein, Attorney At
          Law - Aggressive, Dynamic Representation Since 1942!" As
          Kirk reaches for the door, he notices a small hand-written
          sign, "I don't make change!" He goes inside.
          
          INT. LAW OFFICE
          
          Wood paneling, buzzing fluorescent lights and furniture the
          Salvation Army would sell only as firewood.
          
          Eric and Debbie sit with Kirk's parents. There are two
          elderly women and another middle aged man in the room as
          well. Maury, who's about a hundred years old - cute and
          meek, fusses with an ancient VCR while smoking a cigarette.
          
          Kirk sits down next to Eric. Kirk notices a free bank
          calender on Maury's desk - dated 1991.
          
                              ERIC
                    It's about time, numbnuts.
          
                              KIRK
                    I came right from work.
          
                                                                   39.
          
          
          
                              MR. KETTNER
                    Okay Maury - we're all here.
          
                              MAURY
                    Oh! You bet! You betcha! Okay,
                    hi there Kirk. Firstly, let me
                    just say how awful sorry I am.
                    Stella was one heck of a gal and a
                    real dish. Anyhow, let me just...
          
          Maury gets the VCR going.   "Wheel of Fortune" comes up on the
          screen.
          
                              MAURY (CONT'D)
                    Oh mercy. I didn't tape over her
                    with The Wheel did I?
          
          The picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of
          Grammy sitting in her kitchen. She has just clicked the
          video camera on with a remote control.
          
                                MAURY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, good.    There she is.
          
                              GRAMMY
                    Testing. One, two, three, four.
                    Oh, this God damned thing!
          
          She gets up and fusses with the camera.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Jap piece of shit! Is it on!?
          
          Cutaway to Kirk tearing up.   Grammy sits back down.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, my name is Stella Edith Dakin
                    and if you're watching this, I'm
                    dead as a doorknob and I ain't
                    spent all my money yet. I got shit
                    to do today so I'm going to get
                    right to it. This is my last will
                    and testament and if you miss
                    anything the old Jew's got the
                    paperwork. Okay, here's the
                    deal...
          
          Everyone besides Kirk leans in, excited to hear what they
          might get. A phone rings. Maury looks around but the
          ringing is coming from the TV. Grammy answers the phone.
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Hello? I'm kind of busy right now
                    Eric... Oh, for God's sake, boy!
                    How can you be sure it's even
                    yours? It could be practically
                    anybody's!... No, I'm not paying
                    for that!... Well, then I guess
                    you're going to be a daddy.
                    Congratulations, now I gotta go!
          
          She hangs up, puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Anyway! I love all of you, despite
                    some of the shit you pulled, but I
                    spent my life a gambler and I always
                    put my money on the best bet. The
                    odds of any of you fish doing
                    anything worthwhile with my stack
                    are slim to none. So old Grammy's
                    going all in on Big Slick.
          
          Everyone looks at Kirk who is stunned.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    I'm proud of you, Kirk. Don't let
                    your old Grammy down. Do something
                    good with it.
          
          She blows a kiss, lifts the remote and aims it at the camera.
          
                              GRAMMY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Christ sakes!
          
          She throws the remote at the lens.    The picture goes to snow.
          
                              ERIC
                    So Kirk gets it all!?   That is
                    bullshit!
          
                              KIRK
                    Eric, it can't be much.
          
                              ERIC
                    Well!?
          
          Maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers.    He
          dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic.
          
                              MAURY
                    Let's see here... Looks like she
                    had herself six G's in savings.

                                                                  41.
          
                              MAURY (CONT'D)
                    Um, another three grand in bonds,
                    give or take. Her life insurance
                    will pay pert-near seventy grand.
          
          He adds this up on an old adding machine (the kind with the
          hand crank) and writes $77,800 on a chalk board, which is
          mounted on the wall behind him.
          
                              ERIC
                    She left him eighty grand!?
          
                              MAURY
                    Most of Stella's retirement home
                    expenses were covered by her reverse
                    mortgage. But, figure in thirty
                    thousand still due to Arborwood
                    Village. She racked up forty-seven
                    thousand in medical bills. And my
                    fee, of course, which now stands at
                    two thousand and change - which is
                    real reasonable, folks.
          
          He writes "Liabilities = $79,000    Total -$1,200."
          
                              ERIC
                    So Kirk owes money!? HA! Shit,
                    man! That is God damn hilarious!
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          The upscale restaurant is crowded. Kirk and Molly are eating
          at a small table. Kirk is not relaxed like he had been the
          last time they ate together. He is sweating and trying to
          remain cool. The Maitre d is eyeing them suspiciously.
          
                              MOLLY
                    But, you can't legally be held
                    responsible for her debt. What
                    kind of hack is this attorney?
          
                                 KIRK
                    It's okay.     I had it in savings.
          
          The waiter brings a drink to Molly.
          
                               WAITER
                        (French accent)
                    Madame. From ze gentleman in ze
                    grey suit.
          
          From his table, a good looking man smiles and raises a drink
          to Molly. She nods back - polite but annoyed.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Anyway... Grammy hated owing anyone
                    money. I'm afraid she couldn't
                    rest if she wasn't square with the
                    house. It's the least I can do.
                    She practically raised me.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You're a good man, Kirk.
          
          Molly smiles and takes his hands. The maitre d is watching
          and getting angry. The waiter returns with another drink.
          
                              WAITER
                    From ze gentleman in ze purple tie.
          
          Another guy raises his glass to her from the bar. Molly is
          getting irritated. Kirk is feeling smaller every minute.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Listen, no more drinks.    Please.
          
                                 WAITER
                    Of course.     No more drinks, madame.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    I'm sorry.     This happens sometimes.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I get that a lot too. I'm
                    sure the next one will be for me.
          
          Molly laughs. The best looking man Kirk has ever seen walks
          up to the table. He and Molly hug.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, my gosh! Talon! I didn't
                    realize you were in town already.
          
                              TALON
                    I just flew in this morning.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, this is Talon.    This is my
                    good friend, Kirk.
          
                              TALON
                    Great to meet you, sir.
          
          Talon gives Kirk a winning handshake, complete with wink.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    So, do we have you for our Disabled
                    Angels Program again this year?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Wouldn't miss it.
          
                              TALON
                    That's fantastic. (to Kirk) Mol is
                    always a big hit with the kids.
          
                               MOLLY
                    Please. You're the one the kids go
                    crazy for.
          
                              KIRK
                    So you two work together?
          
                              MOLLY
                    Only once a year. Talon is our
                    charity liaison at the air show.
          
                                TALON
                    And?
          
                              MOLLY
                    And my ex-boyfriend.
          
          Kirk starts to choke. He grabs his water glass and takes a
          swig but the ice collapses and the water pours all over him.
          
                               KIRK
                    Oh, boy.   I guess I better...
          
          Kirk heads off to the bathroom, muttering to himself.
          
                                KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Stupid.    Stupid. Stupid.
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT MEN'S ROOM
          
          Kirk is drying his shirt. A man is still zipping up as he
          takes the next sink. Before washing, he offers a handshake.
          
                              MAX
                    Excuse me. My name is Max Fleming.
                    I'm a financial planner.
          
          Kirk takes the handshake reluctantly and then gets a business
          card. Max then starts to wash up - so does Kirk.
          
                                KIRK
                    Oh, Hi.
          
                                                                     44.
          
          
          
                              MAX
                    Please forgive me but I'm curious.
                    Who manages your portfolio?
          
                              KIRK
                    My portfolio? I don't really...
          
          Max takes the last paper towel - forcing Kirk to drip dry.
          
                              MAX
                    It's okay if you'd rather not say. I
                    admit that selling my services in a
                    men's room is a tad aggressive but
                    isn't that what a man of your means
                    requires in his financial planner?
          
                                KIRK
                    My means.
          
                              MAX
                    Judging by the company you're
                    keeping, I'd say that you're making
                    a handsome living. I can help you
                    do even better.
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT RESTROOM HALL
          
          Kirk exits reading Max's card - somewhat bewildered. The
          Maitre d stops Kirk and speaks in a French accent.
          
                              MAITRE D
                    Excusez-moi Monsieur.   Might I have
                    a word?
          
                                KIRK
                    Oh, sure.    Is everything all right?
          
          The Maitre d looks around and then leans in and speaks
          quietly - now without the French accent.
          
                              MAITRE D
                    My kids eat here. My mother's here
                    right now you son of a bitch.
          
                               KIRK
                    Okay.   Did I...
          
                              MAITRE D
                    Look, I can appreciate that this is
                    not some common street-walker.
                    You're obviously willing to pay for
                    the best but we can't have this
                    kind of thing at my place.
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    What? I'm not paying anyone.
                    We're just on a date.
          
                              MAITRE D
                    You are on a date with her? What
                    am I an idiot? Now, I don't wish
                    to embarrass you, sir, or make a
                    scene. So, enjoy your dinner but,
                    be warned, do not ever bring
                    another professional into my place.
                    (louder and back into the French
                    accent) Tres bien Monsieur!
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT
          
          When Kirk rounds the corner, he sees that Molly and Talon are
          still talking. Kirk hides behind a plant. Molly is beaming.
          She stands to hug Talon and kiss his cheek before he exits
          the restaurant. Kirk returns to the table.
          
                               KIRK
                    Oh, no.   Did I miss Talon?
          
                              MOLLY
                    He had to go but he asked me tell
                    you how much he enjoyed meeting you.
          
                               KIRK
                    Yeah. Super. He, uh, seems like a
                    great guy.
          
                              MOLLY
                    He is. He's wonderful. I know, I
                    know - the blue eyes and the rock
                    hard abs, right? But he's really
                    so much more than that. A gallery
                    in New York just opened an exhibit
                    of his photography. He's a genius.
          
                              KIRK
                        (to the waiter)
                    Can we get the check?
          
                              WAITER
                    Madame, your bill has been covered

          A butch woman in the bar raises a glass in Molly's direction.
          
          INT. MOLLY'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Molly and Kirk pull into a parking lot.
          
                                                                     46.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh my gosh! This is your
                    apartment? I used to live in this
                    neighborhood back in college.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I'm gonna move to a better
                    place pretty soon.
          
                              MOLLY
                    We used to come to parties over
                    here sometimes. Oooohh. Can I
                    come up and see your place?
          
          EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in
          the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the
          balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college
          students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a
          bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of
          Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          Kirk and Molly enter.   The apartment is neat, clean and
          fairly sparse.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's not much, I know.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, I like it!
          
          Molly walks around and examines certain items. Kirk quietly
          hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer
          desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears.
          Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer
          comes to life, revealing a "Hot Back-Door Asians" website.
          Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the
          monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She
          moves on to a rack of DVDs.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Wow, we have a lot of the same
                    DVDs. Life of Brian, Cool Hand
                    Luke, Family Guy... Beaches, Kirk?
          
                               KIRK
                    What?   It's a good movie.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I love that movie.
          
                                                                 47.
          
          
          
          She spots a crate full of vinyl records.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Wow, records. No Way! Look at all

                    She was the coolest person in the
                    whole world.
          
          She notices an upright piano in the corner.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    You play the piano?
          
                              KIRK
                    A little. My grandma taught me.
                    It was kind of our thing. She was
                    a great player. Ragtime, show
                    tunes, that kind of thing. I'm
                    really not very good.
          
          She plops down on the couch.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, I'll bet you're great.   Play
                    something for me.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, I can't really play in front of
                    people.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What, the stage fright thing?    Come
                    on it's just me. Please?
          
                              KIRK
                    No, I really can't. Trust me,
                    you're not missing anything.
          
          Kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into
          a little dance of almost sitting. He finally commits to sit.
          
                              MOLLY
                    So you've never played in front of
                    anyone?
          
                                                                 48.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Nope. Almost did once. A talent
                    show in high school. I just sat up
                    there drenched in sweat. I really
                    thought I could do it but then I
                    made my big mistake.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Let me guess. You looked at the
                    audience.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yep. All these eyes on me. I'm
                    shaking, my head is spinning, I'm
                    trying to remember if I even play
                    the piano... and then, I puked.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Right there on the stage?
          
                              KIRK
                    INTO the piano actually.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Shut up! You're lying!      Why would
                    you do that?
          
                              KIRK
                    It was a reflex. I was trying not
                    to barf on the floor. Turns out
                    it's a lot easier to clean puke off
                    a stage than out of a baby grand.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Yeah, that has to be a real bitch.
                    Oh, I shouldn't be laughing. You
                    poor thing.
          
          Molly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen
          with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too
          far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make
          this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and
          kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic
          but he does his best to keep it together.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry. I'm a little cotton-mouthed.
                    I'm going to get a glass of water.
                    How 'bout for you? Water? A nice
                    glass of, you know...water?
          
                               MOLLY
                    Yeah.   That sounds good.
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          
          Kirk steps away from her and disappears into...
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
          
          He pours a glass of water. He's about to return when he sees
          his reflection in the window. The boner under his khakis is
          not subtle. He looks down and starts to panic.
          
                              KIRK
                    Um... You want anything to eat?
          
                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                    No thanks.
          
          Kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in. He takes a
          few deep, calming breaths.   He closes the fridge - still at
          full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building.
          He grabs a Time Magazine. He flips through frantically. He
          turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal
          women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh come on!
          
          He is sweating like crazy.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    Can I give you a hand?
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   I got it!
          
          Kirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush.   He stares
          at it hard. His boner begins to retreat.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
                              MOLLY
                    Listen Kirk, I want you to know
                    that I would really like to, you
                    know, to be with you tonight.
          
                                 KIRK (O.S.)
                    Really?
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
          
          The boner pops back up. Kirk silently mouths, "MOTHERFUCKER!"
          at his mischievous little man.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    Well, sure. But... I just don't
                    think I'm ready yet.
          
                                                                 50.
          
          
          
          Kirk's reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief.
          
                             KIRK
                    Sure! Sure! Yeah! No problem!
                    Great! That's...that's great!
                    Ice!? You want some ice!?
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    Sure.
          
          Kirk opens the freezer. He puts a few cubes in her water and
          then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          Molly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier.
          
                              MOLLY
                    I mean, don't get me wrong. I want
                    to! Believe me - getting naked and
                    crazy sounds fantastic right now.
          
                              KIRK (O.S.)
                    Shit!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Are you okay?
          
                              KIRK (O.S.)
                    Yeah, fine.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN
          
          Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink. He finds
          duct tape. He pulls some tape off the roll. It makes a loud
          noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up. Kirk
          opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot. He
          coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    I just think we should get to know
                    each other first.   I'm no prude.
                    I mean, I'm pretty generous in bed.
                    Once I trust a person, I like to
                    experiment and get pretty wild.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, dear God.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    But, I just need to feel safe
                    first.
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
          
          Kirk finishes taping up, zips his pants and checks his
          profile in the reflection from the window.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          Kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner.
          
                               KIRK
                    Hey.   I'm totally fine with that.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You're the best.
          
          Kirk gives an "aw-shucks" head tilt.    Molly stands.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, well, I'd better go then.
          
          They walk to the door. Molly leans in and they kiss a few
          moments more. Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little
          snug. She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to
          retrieve them. Suddenly she starts coughing. She puts her
          fist over her mouth.
          
          Kirk's POV:   As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch.
          
          Kirk winces again. She hears the tape start to give way.
          She looks up, slightly confused. Kirk looks around as though
          he's looking for the source of the sound. Molly stands.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I had a really nice time.    I'll
                    call you tomorrow.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Great!
          
          Kirk opens the door for Molly.
          
          EXT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male
          college students are playing foosball on their patio. They
          stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk.
          Molly trots off.
          
                                 COLLEGE STUDENT #1
                    Damn, man!     That chick is fine!
          
          Kirk returns a cool "whassup" nod to the guys.
          
                              COLLEGE STUDENT #2
                    All right Mr. Kettner!
          
                                                                   52.
          
          
          
                              COLLEGE STUDENT #1
                    You wanna play some foos!?
          
                              KIRK
                    No thanks fellas.
          
          Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT
          
          He drifts over to his piano and sits down. The joy of what
          has just happened is plastered on his face. He launches into
          a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp. Soon a
          neighbor is pounding on the wall. Kirk stops playing.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum!
          
          Kirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment.
          He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Ron seems like a swell guy. I love
                    Pizza Hut. What? Who's this?
                    Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly.
                    Oh, don't be that way. Oh, there,
                    there, now. Here's a tissue.
          
          He drops the picture and continues the dance.
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile
          continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk
          sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open
          like a shot and he reaches for his phone - "No Missed Calls."
          
          MONTAGE OVER MUSIC:
          
          1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom.   He checks his
          gut and hairline in the mirror.
          
          2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the
          box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached
          along with a card that reads, "Happy Graduation - Love Mom
          and Dad." He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads
          the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor.
          He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses
          underneath him. He checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
          
          3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the
          cupboards.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl.
          He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal
          and then checks his phone. "No Missed Calls."
          
          3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men
          site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very
          pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and
          gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her
          score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten.
          He checks his phone. He moves on to "BackDoorAsians.com."
          
          4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower
          third reads, "AMC's 24 Hours of Bond." No Missed Calls. The
          sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls.
          Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them
          as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching
          Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is
          creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is
          still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.
          
          5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess -
          tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the
          magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous
          picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur
          Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his
          own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack.
          
          6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T-
          shirt he sees reads, "NO MISSED CALLS."
          
          MUSIC FADES OUT
          
          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY
          
          He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in
          the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts
          to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the
          charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and
          listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room.
          Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch.
          In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up
          papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's
          panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives
          for it, losing his towel in the process.
          
                               KIRK
                    Hello!?   Hello!?
          
                              STAINER (V.O.)
                    Took you long enough. What were
                    you doing, taking a growler?
          
          Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him.   She
          can see his ass through the window. He covers up.
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry, Mrs. Nuesbaum.
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY
          
          Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the
          shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for
          Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer
          who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk, it's a simple rule of life.
                    Look around. People are pretty
                    evenly matched.
          
          Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus
          stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk.
          Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty,
          ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one
                    who asked me out. So, why...
          
                              STAINER
                    That first night, were you
                    intimidated by her?
          
                              KIRK
                    No, I didn't think I had a chance.
          
                             STAINER
                    Exactly. So you were relaxed and
                    funny. You were on.
          
          Stainer posts several "Wheel in the Sky" flyers on a kiosk.
          
                              KIRK
                    So I gotta get back to that.
          
                              STAINER
                    That's just it, Kirky. Now that
                    she's opened the door, you can't
                    get back to that.
          
                              KIRK
                    So I'll have to fake it?
          
                              STAINER
                    Forget it. You can't fake that
                    far. A broad like her - she'll
                    smell that horseshit a mile away.
          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          
          Kirk and Stainer enter a...
          
          EXT. CAFE FRONT PATIO
          
          ...and take a table on the crowded patio.
          
                              STAINER
                    Can we get a couple of menus?
                    (then to Kirk) You eating?
          
                              KIRK
                    Maybe just a salad.
          
                              STAINER
                    Dude, one salad ain't going make up
                    for thirty years of chili dogs.
          
                              KIRK
                    I know. But I got dinner with my
                    folks later.
          
                              STAINER
                    Fun. Be sure and stab your brother
                    in the eye with a fork for me.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight.
          
          Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with
          knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainer's table on their way
          to the valet stand. Stainer rolls his eyes.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    You know what - this is ridiculous.
                    I'm just going to call her.
          
                              STAINER
                    Fuck you are! Put that thing away.
                    You do not call her. Don't you get
                    it? Talon is back in town.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, she broke up with him.
          
                              STAINER
                    So, you're telling me you were
                    sitting there, a sweating,
                    quivering stutter-bucket and when
                    you came back from the can, Molly's
                    hugging a guy who's so good looking
                    you'd probably fuck him. What do
                    you think she's doing this weekend?
          
                                                                   56.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    So what am I supposed to do?
          
                              STAINER
                    What can you do? She hasn't called
                    - she's not going to.
          
                              KIRK
                    You're probably right.
          
                              STAINER
                    Just count yourself lucky. You got
                    to kiss a goddess and you got out
                    before she recalibrated your
                    hardware. A chick like that can
                    raise the bar too high and then
                    once she dumps you, nobody else
                    measures up.
          
                              KIRK
                    No, you're right. You know what -
                    it's good. It's better. I'm
                    actually relieved. You should have
                    seen this Talon guy. Man! All
                    I've been thinking about is having
                    to be naked in front of her. I
                    don't need that kind of pressure.
          
          The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and
          the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his
          head as if to say, "Was there even a doubt?"
          
          Kirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings.   Kirk and
          Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller ID.
          
                              STAINER
                    Don't do it!
          
          The phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone.
          Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's
          eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening
          eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes
          calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's
          wrist, pinning it to the table. RING!
          
                              KIRK
                    Cut it out!
          
                                 STAINER
                    Let it go!
          
                                                                    57.
          
          
          
          RING! Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but
          Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around
          like battling snakes. Kirk presses the button to answer the
          call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hello!?... Oh, no problem! Yeah I
                    was super busy yesterday anyway.
          
                              STAINER
                    Would you look at yourself?
          
          Stainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away.
          
                              KIRK
                    Well, I have dinner with my folks
                    tonight... Oh, I wouldn't want to
                    subject you to them... Okay. If
                    you want to. I can pick you up...
          
          Kirk gives a confident smile and an "I told you she'd call"
          nod. Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Oh, sure. Well then let me call
                    you back in a few minutes and I'll
                    give you directions. Alrighty.
                    Yeah. Buh-bye.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, I guess you just solved that.
                    An hour with your family and she'll
                    file for a restraining order.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. Eric's not going to be there.
                    It's going to be good. You might
                    be wrong about Molly. She might...
          
          Stainer spots a round little boy posting a "Lost Puppy" flyer
          over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk.
          
                              STAINER
                        (to the boy)
                    Whoa! I don't think so Spanky!   A
                    little lower!
          
          The boy instead posts it over a "Walk For a Cure" poster.
          
          EXT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
          
          Molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a
          quaint residential street.
          
                                                                     58.
          
          
          She climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small
          sheet of paper. She sees Kirk sitting on the front porch.
          
                              KIRK
                    You found it!
          
                              MOLLY
                    I had good directions!
          
          She steps up the front walk toward Kirk, who points to a
          little yellow note taped to the front door.
          
                              KIRK
                    I'm sorry. My folks aren't back
                    yet. We're locked out.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You don't have a key?
          
                              KIRK
                    No. My dad's kind of obsessed with
                    home-security. Like someone's
                    going to break in and steal his
                    Reader's Digest collection.
          
          A very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a
          beagle on a leash. The man struggles a bit with the dog.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Hi, Mr. Riley!
          
                              MR. RILEY
                    Well, howdy Kirk!
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey, what do say you take the night
                    off and I'll take Noodle around the
                    block for you? (to Molly) Are you
                    up for a walk?
          
                              MOLLY
                    That sounds great.
          
                              MR. RILEY
                    Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice.
          
          Kirk jogs over to take the leash.   Noodle jumps up on Kirk.
          He and Molly pet the excited dog.
          
                              KIRK
                        (baby talk)
                    Yes! Always happy to see you,
                    pretty girl! Yes you are a pretty
                    girl! Yes you are!
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
          Molly takes note - animal lover - big points.
          
                              MR. RILEY
                    You're a good boy, Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's no trouble at all.
          
          Molly and Kirk start down the sidewalk with Noodle. An old
          woman comes out of the next house with her dog on a leash.
          
                               OLD WOMAN
                    Honey!?   Are you back in business!?
          
                              KIRK
                        (To Molly)
                    I had a little neighborhood dog-
                    walking service when I was a kid .
                    (to the woman) No problem, Mrs. D,
                    we can take Norton along too!
          
          Several soft-faded cuts as Kirk and Molly move through the
          neighborhood. Soon they have a third dog. Kirk points out
          landmarks as they talk and laugh. Now they have a fourth
          dog. Molly takes his arm.
          
          The evening light is a bit dimmer as they give Noodle back to
          Mr. Riley. Kirk turns toward his parents' house. Now
          there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked-up, knobby-
          tired pick-up parked out front. The truck has two bumper
          stickers ("One Nation Under GOD!" and "No Fat Chicks!")
          flanking a vanity license plate that reads, "ERIX-TOY."
          Kirk's shoulders slump at the sight of it.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, you know what I'm thinking,
                    let's go get Chinese.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What are you talking about?   I want
                    to meet your family.
          
          They start toward the door.   Molly's cell phone rings.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I'm so sorry. It's Patty. I've
                    got to take this. Go ahead. I'll
                    be right in.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME - EVENING
          
          Kirk comes through the front door to find his father in the
          living room watching a hockey game.
          
                                                                     60.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                    Hey dad.
          
                              MR. KETTNER
                        (without looking up)
                    Kirk.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER (O.S.)
                    Hi sweetie!
          
          Eric steps out of the kitchen with three beers.
          
                              ERIC
                    Close the door, fucknut.
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey Eric. I thought you were
                    hanging drywall tonight.
          
                              ERIC
                    Nah. Fuckin' Leroy fired me again.
                    Like that dick never came to work
                    with a little buzz on.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, listen, I brought a date
                    tonight. I really like her.
                    Please don't embarrass me in front
                    of her. I'll do anything you want.
          
                              ERIC
                    I promise I won't mention her
                    goiter.
          
          Eric and Dad crack up.
          
          A flushing sound and then Ron comes out of the bathroom.
          He's buckling up. Kirk's shoulders drop again.
          
                              RON
                    I did like you said Mr. K.
          
          Eric tosses Ron and Mr. Kettner each a beer.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, hey Ron. So Marnie's here?
          
          Marnie appears in the door of the kitchen. She's holding a
          corningware pot filled with mashed potatoes.
          
          Molly finishes her call. She's up the front steps and Kirk
          lets her in. Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner are stunned. Marnie
          drops the pot and it smashes on the floor in front of her.
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          Mrs. Kettner and Debbie rush out to see what Marnie is gaping
          at. Debbie (still pregnant) is immediately threatened by the
          way Eric is looking at Molly.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    Everyone, this is Molly McCall.
          
          Kirk's never seen his family so impressed. He can't hide his
          grin. Ron pops the cap off his beer and it overflows a bit.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kirk, Molly, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Marnie, Ron and Debbie sit
          around the kitchen table and feast on a meatloaf dinner.
          Eric is at the fridge grabbing a beer. Marnie is angrily
          watching Ron whose eyes are all over Molly.
          
                              ERIC
                    You want another one Dad?
          
                              MR. KETTNER
                    You read my mind.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    You two take it easy now. We have
                    guests. (THEN) Eric honey, I'm
                    sure if you apologize to Leroy,
                    he'll take you back.
          
          Eric returns to the table with the beers.
          
                              ERIC
                    Nah, fuck him. Anyways, Leroy ain't
                    payin' shit ever since he trucked
                    in all those spics from Fresno.
          
                              KIRK
                    Geeze Eric!
          
          Ron looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that...
          
                              RON
                    I got this, Kirk. Eric, before you
                    go bad-mouthin' a whole group of
                    people, you should know that my
                    grandmother on my father's side is
                    from Fresno.
          
                              ERIC
                    Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
                    (THEN) So, Molly. What do you do?
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'm an event planner.
          
                                                                  62.

                    You see? That's using your head.
                    That's a business to get into.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Well, thank you Eric.
          
                              ERIC
                    Book a band, blow up a few balloons
                    and people pay out the ass for it.
          
                              KIRK
                    There's a little more to it than
                    that, Eric. Molly handles some big
                    events. She's even doing a benefit
                    with Billy Joel next month.
          
                              MOLLY
                        (PLAYFULLY)
                    Actually, Eric's right.   Just a few
                    balloons.
          
          Molly smiles to reassure Kirk that she can handle herself.

                    owner myself. A little restaurant.
          
                              MARNIE
                    I wouldn't really call it a
                    restaurant, Ron.

                    It's a Pizza Hut with no tables.
                    It's a take out place.
          
                              ERIC
                    So, Molly, me and Debbie here are
                    getting hitched. What do you get
                    for a wedding job?
          
          Kirk raises his eyebrows into "please-behave-yourself" puppy
          dog eyes. Eric shoots back an "oh whatever" sneer.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Hmmm. Honestly, I don't really do a
                    lot of weddings. I specialize more
                    in fund-raisers, corporate events,
                    that kind of thing.

          But you've done weddings.
          
                    MOLLY
          I've done a few.
          
                    ERIC
          So, what do you get for one?

          Dad, could you...
          
                    DEBBIE
          Don't get your panties in a wad,
          Kirk. He's just making
          conversation.
          
                    MOLLY
          Geeze, there are so many factors
          that affect the cost of a wedding.
          
                    ERIC
          We're looking at about two hundred
          people and we're gonna do this
          whole Nascar theme.

          tux with a big Home Depot logo on
          the back and Tony Stewart's number
          20 on the shoulders.

          Eric, please.

                    Okay. Before expenses, my base fee
                    for a non-charity event is fifteen
                    thousand. So, I'd ballpark that
                    somewhere around twenty-five grand.

                    Fuck a duck.
          
          For a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the
          conversation. Kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter.
          
                              ERIC (CONT'D)
                    So you're making a comfortable
                    living, you seem like you got your
                    head together more or less and
                    Christ, look at ya. What the hell
                    you doing with numbnuts here?
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    Eric!
          
                              ERIC
                    Come on, Ma - we're all thinking it.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    Molly, I'm so sorry.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, it's fine. The truth is, Kirk
                    and I are just getting to know one
                    another but so far, I think he's
                    decent, he's funny and... You
                    know, when we first met, Kirk asked
                    me in all sincerity if I knew how
                    to do an oil change.
          
          Eric, Ron and Mr. Kettner each let out a quick burst of "yeah
          right" laughter.
          
                             MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    I know! And, you're right, I don't
                    but... I just love that he asked.
          
          A moment passes as they all process this. The women at the
          table all know exactly what Molly means. The men are simply
          confused.
          
                              ERIC
                    Funny? Kirk is funny?    Tell us a
                    joke there Sinbad.
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    (to Kirk) Well I hope you can hold
                    onto this one pumpkin. (to Molly)
                    When Marnie broke up with him he
                    was devastated for months, the poor
                    little guy.
          
          Marnie looks up, surprised and touched by the comment.   Kirk
          is mortified.
          
                              ERIC
                    No shit, when you dump him, he's
                    liable to kill himself.
          
          Kirk rubs his own head to keep it from exploding. Molly calms
          him with a hand on his back. This move isn't lost on Marnie.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Kirk splashes water on his face and then looks for a towel
          but can't find one. He's forced to use his sleeve. He is a
          wreck. He takes a deep breath and steps out into...
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' HOME ENTRY HALL
          
          ...to find Marnie at the front door putting her coat on.
          
                              KIRK
                    Are you heading home?
          
                              MARNIE
                    Got to get home and let Peanut out.
                    (she wipes some lint off of Kirk's
                    shirt sleeve.) Kirk, you look
                    really good.
          
                               KIRK
                    Thanks.   You do too.
          
          Marnie smiles a sad smile.
          
                               MARNIE
                    Ron!   Let's go!
          
                              RON
                    I'm coming! It was really
                    fantastic to meet you Molly.   If
                    you ever need a pizza...
          
          Ron gives Molly a hug that makes Marnie as uncomfortable as
          it does Molly. He then passes Kirk as he crosses to the
          front door, carrying a pile of foiled over paper plates.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          
                              RON (CONT'D)
                    Cripes Kirk! Crack a window in
                    there pirate! HAHAHA!
          
          Ron and Marnie exit.   Kirk walks back into...
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' KITCHEN
          
          Mrs. Kettner and Molly are cleaning up.
          
                              KIRK
                    Molly, you don't have to do that.
          
                              MOLLY
                    No, It's fine.
          
                              MRS. KETTNER
                    You let us have some girl time.
                    Take these downstairs to your dad.
          
          She hands Kirk a bag of Fritos and shoes him through the
          basement door.
          
          INT. KIRK'S PARENTS' BASEMENT - NIGHT
          
          Kirk's father has built a tacky little basement bar decorated
          with neon beer signs and Eric's old trophies and ribbons.
          Mr. Kettner and Debbie sit at the bar and smoke as Eric
          stands behind the bar and serves them cocktails. Kirk comes
          down the basement stairs and joins them. The hockey game
          wrap-up highlights are running on a TV mounted above the bar.
          
                              KIRK
                    So, what was the final score?
          
                              ERIC
                    You think you're hot shit now?    Is
                    that it?
          
                              KIRK
                    Look, Eric, you've had a lot to
                    drink tonight and...
          
                              DEBBIE
                    Don't tell him what to do. (to
                    Eric) You're doing fine, baby.
          
                              ERIC
                    You think you're better than me.
                    Say it. Well take a look around,
                    Big Slick. (re: trophies) Every
                    one of these says Eric. First
                    place! First Place! M.V.P.!

                              ERIC (CONT'D)
                    Winner! Winner! You think you're
                    the winner now? Well forget it,

                        (STANDING)
                    Well, it's been fun.
          
                              MR. KETTNER
                    Now don't be that way, boy. All
                    your big brother is trying to say
                    is that we're worried about you.
          
                              ERIC
                    You show up here with that piece of
                    ass!? Either you're fucking with
                    us or she's fucking with you so
                    which is it?
          
                              KIRK
                    Look, I know she's a little out of
                    my league but...
          
                              ERIC
                    A little!? Are you shitting me?
                    Alright, alright! I think we can
                    all agree that Debbie here is one
                    wicked hot box.
          
          Debbie smiles and squeezes Eric's hand. Mr. Kettner nods and
          raises his glass.
          
                              KIRK
                    She's um... very attractive.
          
                              ERIC
                    Yeah, and this Molly makes her look
                    like a pig.
          
          Debbie lets go of Eric's hand and storms upstairs.
          
                              ERIC (CONT'D)
                    You see? This girl of yours is
                    already startin' shit. (Calling
                    after Debbie) Come on baby! Kirk
                    didn't mean nothing by that!
          
                              KIRK
                    Look, I don't know what's going on
                    either but...
          
                              ERIC
                    I'm goin' upstairs and gettin' to
                    the bottom of this.
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
          
                                  KIRK
                    Eric!   No!
          
                              ERIC
                    I think this gal is messing with my
                    little brother and I'm not going to
                    sit still for it.
          
                              KIRK
                    Eric! Okay! I know! I'm sure
                    she's just slumming or something
                    and it's all going to be over any
                    minute but, Jesus Christ! She'll
                    come to her senses without any help
                    from you! She's up there with...
          
          Kirk turns to point up the stairs. As he glances back, he
          finds Molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down
          at him. Before Kirk can get a word out, Molly storms out of
          the house. Kirk runs upstairs but she's in her car before he
          can get out the front door. Eric appears behind him.
          
                              ERIC
                    Way to go numbnuts. You should
                    have let me handle it.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Kirk stands at work, searching Habib's bag and looking
          grouchy. Fuller monitors Kirk, arms crossed. Habib lets out
          a long irritated sigh.
          
                               KIRK
                    I know.   I'm sorry, man.
          
          Kirk hands the bag back to Habib and sends him on his way.
          Randy, another agent, hands Kirk a note.
          
          INSERT: The note reads, "Kirk, We need to talk.     I'm in the
          food court. -M."
          
          Kirk sighs.   Stainer is now reading over Kirk's shoulder.
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, I guess this is it. I'm
                    surprised she even bothered.
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT
          
          The food court is crowded.     Kirk looks around for Molly but
          does not see her.
          
                                                                  69.
          
          
          
                              MARNIE (O.S.)
                    Good, you got my note.
          
          Kirk turns to find Marnie sitting at a table working on a
          Burrito Supreme.
          
                                    KIRK
                    Oh.     Yeah.     Hi.
          
                              MARNIE
                    I'm sorry to bug you at work but
                    this couldn't wait.
          
          Kirk sits down.
          
                              MARNIE (CONT'D)
                    Kirk, I think I messed up. I see a
                    change in you and I like it. So, I
                    was thinking that we should
                    maybe... get back together. Just
                    to try it out, you know?
          
                                KIRK
                    Wow.    I don't know, Marnie.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Why not? Please don't say it's
                    because of this Molly person.
          
                               KIRK
                    No, I think I already screwed that
                    up anyway.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Good. I was really worried about
                    you with her. She seems like kind
                    of a bitch.
          
                                KIRK
                    What?    She is not.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Well, she acts like she's better
                    than everyone with her hybrid car
                    and her la-de-da charity work.
          
                              KIRK
                    She doesn't do that at all, Marnie.
                    You're just putting that on her.
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          
                              MARNIE
                    Okay, maybe so. See? This is what
                    I mean. You never argued with me
                    before. You're really growing.
          
                              KIRK
                    What about Ron?
          
                              MARNIE
                    If you want to get back together,
                    of course, I'll break up with Ron.
          
                              KIRK
                    You mean you're still with him?
          
                              MARNIE
                    I'm not going to risk being all
                    alone just because you don't know
                    what's good for you. Come on,
                    Kirk. Deep down, you know where
                    you belong.
          
                              KIRK
                    You're right, I think I do.   Say hi
                    to Ron for me.
          
          Kirk stands and walks away.
          
          EXT. AIR SHOW ENTRANCE - DAY
          
          Kirk and Stainer are at the ticket gate. Kirk pays for his
          ticket but Stainer stands staring at him.
          
                              KIRK
                    What?
          
                              STAINER
                    This wasn't my idea. I ain't
                    dropping twenty bucks to go in
                    there. God-damned planes are in
                    the sky. I can see 'em just fine
                    from the parking lot for free.
          
          Kirk begrudgingly buys Stainer a ticket.
          
          EXT. AIR SHOW
          
          Kirk and Stainer move through the crowd. Stainer now carries
          a corn dog, a giant soda and an armload of Air Show
          memorabilia, including an inflatable F/A-18 Hornet.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    She's working one of the kids'
                    charities. I'm guessing they might
                    be down by the rides.
          
                              STAINER
                    Whoa dude, check it out.   The Blue
                    Angels!
          
          Five men in flight suits and aviator sunglasses strut through
          the crowd in slow motion. They exude masculine confidence.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Those are the coolest guys in the
                    entire world. Think about it -
                    George Clooney or Derek Jeter would
                    trade places with those guys in a
                    second. Can you imagine the sheer
                    magnitude of puss those fuckers tag?
                    I'm gonna get 'em to sign my Hornet!
          
          Stainer runs toward them. He joins some kids and beautiful
          women who are already getting autographs.
          
          Kirk spots Molly working a charity booth. He crosses to her.
          She turns to him with a this-better-be-good stance.
          
                              KIRK
                    Molly.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    I just wanted to apologize for last
                    night... for my family.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Your family I can deal with.
          
                              KIRK
                    And for me... For what I said.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Do you really think I'm that
                    shallow? You think I need to slum?
          
                              KIRK
                    No. I don't know what to think.
                    You just have to understand that
                    this is a new area for me. Believe
                    it or not, I don't have gobs of
                    experience with beautiful women.
          
                                                                     72.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Is that all I am to you?
          
                              KIRK
                    No, but I don't have much
                    experience with brilliant,
                    successful, wonderful women either.
          
          This melts Molly a bit.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, this can't work if you put me
                    up on some kind of pedestal.
          
                              KIRK
                    It's not that I... Okay, look...
                    When I was a kid, we played a lot
                    of baseball in my neighborhood.
                    The worst part was picking teams
                    because I was always picked last.
                    Every time. Like they couldn't
                    start a friggin' game without first
                    establishing how much I sucked.
                    So, now you come along and make me
                    feel like the first pick. But...
                    what if I can't hit?
          
          Molly softens and smiles.
          
                              MOLLY
                    You already got to first base.
                    Just keep your eye on the ball.
          
          Kirk nods and smiles back.   Molly steals a quick kiss.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Let me tie up a couple things and
                    I'll show you around the grounds.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sounds good.
          
          Molly goes into a tent to speak to Patty.    Kirk watches her
          with a calm, relieved smile.
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Boy, she sure is something, huh?
          
          Kirk turns toward the imposing Blue Angel pilot standing
          behind him. The pilot removes his shades - it's Talon.
          
                                                                  73.
          
          
          
                              TALON
                    It's Kirk right? (firm handshake)
                    Excellent to see you again, sir.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Oh, Talon.     You're a Blue Angel?
          
                              TALON
                    Yes sir, a Naval Aviator.
          
                              KIRK
                    Perfect. Okay, I get it - Talon is
                    what - your call-sign?
          
                              TALON
                    No, it's my name.
          
                              KIRK
                    Then what's your call-sign?
          
                              TALON
                    Oh, I'd rather not say. It's
                    embarrassing. Just something the
                    guys gave me...
          
          Talon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the
          booth.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    Anyway listen Kirk, is it fair to
                    say that you and Mol are close?
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I guess.
          
                              TALON
                    Well, I understand that fellas like
                    yourself tend to have uniquely
                    candid relationships with the women
                    they befriend. Am I right?
          
                              KIRK
                    Fellas like myself?
          
                              TALON
                    Don't get me wrong. I have no
                    problem with your lifestyle. What
                    grown men do in the privacy of
                    their homes is none of my concern.
          
                              KIRK
                    Talon, I'm not...
          
                                                                     74.
          
          
          
                              TALON
                    Hey, I'm in the Navy. I don't ask
                    and I don't expect you to tell.
          
          Talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    Now, I don't know what Molly's told
                    you about me, but anything bad - I
                    deserve. I hurt that girl. I hurt
                    one of God's own angels and I've
                    regretted it every minute since.
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   She speaks very highly...
          
                              TALON
                    God as my witness, I WILL make it
                    right. I WILL get her back. Can I
                    count on you to put in the good
                    word for me, Poncho?
          
                              KIRK
                    Um... Sure.
          
                              TALON
                    You're the man. Come here.
          
          Talon embraces Kirk in a tight hug.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    There you go. Feel the tolerance.
          
          Another Blue Angel calls over while signing Stainer's plane.
          
                             BLUE ANGEL #2
                    Yo! Foot-Long! We scramble in
                    ten.
          
                               TALON
                    Roger!
          
          Talon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels
          walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    That was Talon.
          
                              STAINER
                    Who? The Blue Angel guy?    (cracking
                    up) Duuuuude!
          
          Molly joins them.
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
          
          MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE:
          
          1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd.
          Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on
          Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close
          on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate
          formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
          out "MOLLY" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly
          (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his
          insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
          
          2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes
          his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the
          screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.
          The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
          man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and
          stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's
          gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
          Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is
          oblivious to this exchange.
          
          3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has
          stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,
          he is tackled by two cops.
          
                                 COP
                       Nice try pervert!
          
          Molly spins around, horrified.
          
                                 COP (CONT'D)
                       It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of
                       shit was following you but we got
                       him.
          
          Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the
          cop's grasp.
          
          4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at
          the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal
          detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
          of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels
          he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
          come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
          carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up
          and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.
          
          FADE MUSIC
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack
          and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          The place is decorated with balloons and streamers.   A huge
          banner reads, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE!"
          
                              STAINER
                    Seriously, what's with the banner?
                    She's blind, right? Seems like
                    they could have saved a few bucks
                    there.
          
          Patty runs in.
          
                              PATTY
                    Here they come! Everybody hide!
          
                              STAINER
                    Is that really necessary?
          
                               KIRK
                    Stainer!   Just hide.
          
          They hide. Molly leads her sister, KATIE, into the
          restaurant. "Surprise!" Molly hugs Katie.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                        (to Stainer)
                    Still think she's Al Qaeda?
          
          Stainer brushes off the comment.   Molly waves Kirk over.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Katie, I'd like you to meet Kirk.
          
                              KATIE
                    It's so nice to meet you, I've
                    heard great things.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, thank you. Molly raves about
                    her big sister non-stop.
          
                                KATIE
                    May I?
          
          Katie reaches out to feel Kirk's face. She's a bit perplexed
          by the result. Two blind teenaged boys approach.
          
                              BLIND TEEN
                    Mrs. McCall?
          
                                KATIE
                    Robert!    Is Jerry with you?
          
                              JERRY
                    Yes, ma'am. Happy Birthday.
          
                                                                    77.
          
          
          
                              KATIE
                    It's so nice you came. (to Molly)
                    These are two of my star pupils,
                    Robert and Jerry. Boys, this is my
                    sister, Molly.
          
                              JERRY
                    It's nice to meet you.
          
          They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one
          another like a couple of horny construction workers.
          
          A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but
          uncopyrighted birthday song. Katie blows out her candles.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What's your wish, Katie?
          
                              KATIE
                    I wish Kirk would play the piano
                    for me.
          
          Kirk's face drops. Molly kisses her sister on the forehead
          as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty
          is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline
          but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the
          piano bench. Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.
          
                               KIRK
                    Really.   I can barely play.
          
                              KATIE
                    Come on, Kirk! For my birthday?
          
          Kirk is sweating. He reaches for the keys but he is now
          white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking
          what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around,
          hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the
          room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though
          he might vomit.
          
          Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly,
          a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound
          system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends.
          
          Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off.    Talon
          appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.
          
                              TALON
                    It's okay Kirk. You'll rock us
                    next time right chief?
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, hey Talon. Thanks.
          
                              TALON
                    I'm glad you're here. I feel
                    terrible about our little
                    misunderstanding. I don't know
                    what had me thinking you were a gay
                    fella. Molly tells me you two have
                    been seeing each other.
          
          Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look.
          
                              TALON (CONT'D)
                    She's got every right. I'd hate me
                    too. (THEN) I want to congratulate
                    you, Poncho. You're the better man.
                    Now, I'll step aside and truly wish
                    you the best of luck. I wouldn't
                    wish losing that girl on my worst
                    foe. But, make no mistake, you blow
                    it and I'll be waiting in wings.
                    Love and war, right chief?
          
          Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute. Kirk holds
          his forced confidence until Talon departs. Once alone,
          Kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair.
          
          The party goes on and Katie opens a small present.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Oh, it's a DVD.
          
                              KATIE
                    Who's this from?
          
          Nobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer.
          
                               STAINER
                    What?   It's closed captioned.
          
          Patty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is
          away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass
          to them. Patty gives Talon the finger.
          
                              KIRK
                    What did he do?
          
                              PATTY
                    Listen, Molly would kill me if she
                    knew I was telling you this but I'm
                    trying to do you a favor.
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                    Okay.
          
                              PATTY
                    Molly has this physical...um issue.
                    You know, kind of like a birth
                    defect?
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, my God.
          
                              PATTY
                    It's not a big deal but she's
                    really self-conscious about it.
                    Talon and some other guys she's
                    dated have been weirded out and
                    made her feel like a freak.
          
                              KIRK
                    What is it?
          
                              PATTY
                    It's better if she tells you but if
                    you can't deal with it, just get
                    lost now and don't put her through
                    that heartbreak again.
          
                               KIRK
                    No, no.   I wouldn't do that.
          
                              PATTY
                    Good. 'Cause if you do, it'll be
                    your last conscious act... (she
                    stands) Cake?
          
          Patty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering
          this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small
          black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses
          the room and walks out to the...
          
          EXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK
          
          He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance
          similar to the one he had done after their first kiss.
          
          Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and
          Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and
          peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys
          come around the front to join Kirk.
          
                               STAINER
                    Dude?
          
                                                                    80.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                        (playfully chipper)
                    My friends! Whassup Bitches!
          
                               DEVON
                    What?   What's going on?
          
                              KIRK
                    My troubles are over boys! It's
                    all going to work out! Check it
                    out - Molly has... Wait for it...
          
          Kirk pauses for dramatic effect and then puts his thumbs up.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    ...a birth defect!
          
                                 DEVON
                    Excuse me?
          
                              JACK
                    That's terrible.
          
                               KIRK
                    No.   That's awesome!   Don't you get
                    it?
          
                                 DEVON
                    Ahhhh No.
          
                              STAINER
                    Sure, I get it. She needs a good
                    guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she
                    dates can't handle it, right?
          
                              KIRK
                    It sent Talon packing.
          
          Kirk and Stainer high five.    Jack and Devon look disturbed.
          
                              DEVON
                    Well, what's wrong with her?
          
                              KIRK
                    I don't know yet. Patty just said
                    she had a physical issue.
          
                              DEVON
                    Well that could be anything. Did
                    she say it was a birth defect?
          
                                                                 81.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    She said it was, "something like a
                    birth defect."
          
                              JACK
                    What if it's something really bad?
          
                              KIRK
                    I hope it is. I hope it's
                    something that would make most guys
                    run screaming. It won't matter to
                    me. I love her.
          
                              JACK
                    That's cool that you love her but
                    it's pretty fucked up to be rooting
                    for a harsh deformity.
          
                              DEVON
                    Oh, wow. What if this is Patty's way
                    of telling you that Molly is a man?
          
                              STAINER
                    Hey, if that chick has a dick, I'll
                    suck it!
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Kirk and Molly are cleaning up after the party. Kirk is
          relaxed and in a fantastic mood. Patty gets her coat and
          hugs Molly before exiting. Molly sheepishly approaches Kirk.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, I'm so sorry about the piano
                    thing. It was stupid of me.
          
                              KIRK
                    No. I know what you were trying to
                    do. It's okay. I wish I could
                    have played for her but...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Well, anyway, thanks for all your
                    help with Katie's party. I know it
                    meant a lot to her.
          
          Molly kisses Kirk. Now he's calm and kisses her back
          passionately. She smiles a naughty smile at him.
          
                               MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Tonight?
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                    Tonight.
          
          They start cleaning up as fast as they can.   Kirk is beaming!
          
          INT. MOLLY'S CONDO - NIGHT
          
          MONTAGE OVER LOVE SONG:
          
          Kirk and Molly enter her modern, luxurious condo.   Kirk takes
          her coat. They kiss.
          
          Kirk opens a bottle of wine.   He pours one glass to share.
          
          They sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on!    He is confident
          and silly and Molly is eating it up.
          
          They are making out passionately on the couch.
          
          Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and
          his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at
          it as if to say, "How 'bout them apples!?" Molly laughs and
          leads him into the bedroom.
          
          Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He
          lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness
          but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of
          gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out.
          
          Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this.   He
          decides to sit.
          
          Molly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and
          slippers. She looks perfect. She crosses to the bed and
          sits down next to Kirk. They kiss but Molly stops.
          
          MUSIC REDUCED TO BACKGROUND
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, before we do this, there's
                    something I'm really insecure about
                    and you're going to see it sooner
                    or later so...
          
                              KIRK
                    Hey, take a look at me.
          
          Molly smiles nervously. She stands in front of him, Crying
          Game style. She removes her feet from her slippers and looks
          down at them. Kirk looks down. Even her feet are fantastic.
          
                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                                                                     83.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    Don't rush me... Okay, look.
          
          She parts her toes.    They are webbed.   Kirk's face drops.
          
                                 KIRK
                    That's it?
          
          Kirk jumps up and paces around.

                    Jesus Christ! I can't! I thought
                    you were going to show me some kind
                    of hairy growth or a third nipple or
                    something I could work with!

                    You know what's wrong with me!?
                    I'll tell you! I'm fat! I'm bald!
                    I'm ugly! I'm hairy! I'm
                    uncoordinated! I'm uncreative! I'm
                    not a college graduate! I've never
                    been to Europe! I have a shitty

                    show me a good reason why she's
                    messing around with the likes of
                    me! And this is all you got!? You

                    reasons.

                    That doesn't get a three hooked up

                    Are you fucking kidding me!?
          
          Kirk grabs his coat and heads out the door.    Molly slumps
          onto her bed and cries as the door slams.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Kirk is at his post looking terribly sad. Stainer is working
          at the same lane and is obviously feeling bad for his friend.
          
          Fuller taps Kirk on the shoulder to alert him that Habib is
          coming through. Habib sees this and takes his bag straight
          to the search table, where he opens it for Kirk. Kirk
          doesn't look inside.
          
                              KIRK
                    Go on, Habib. You're good.
          
                               HABIB
                    Really!?   Great!
          
          Habib steps off to his gate.   Fuller gets in Kirk's face.
          
                                                                 85.

                    you Kettner. Thin ice mister!
          
          Kirk stomps away from the checkpoint.
          
                              FULLER (CONT'D)
                    Good! Don't come back, Kettner!
                    America is safer without you!
          
          Stainer goes after Kirk.
          
          EXT. AIRPORT CURB
          
          Kirk walks out the doors. Stainer catches up to him and they
          walk down the busy curb at a quick, angry pace.

                    both knew this Molly thing wasn't
                    going to work out! It ain't my

                    What the fuck you talkin' about?

                    not the point! You're supposed to
                    be my God damned best friend. You

                    What if she actually liked me!?

                    have pulled it off!
          
          Kirk steps onto an...
          
          INT. AIRPORT SHUTTLE BUS
          
          Willy (the Russian) is behind the wheel and as happy as ever.
          A few others are seated on the bus. Stainer follows Kirk on
          board. They remain standing, holding onto poles.
          
                              WILLY
                    It is Kirk and his crazy friend
                    Stinker and they are most upset!
          
          Willy steps on it and drives like a maniac, knocking Kirk and
          Stainer around as they argue.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk, she was going to hurt you.
          
                              KIRK
                    Look at me! I'm hurt now!
          
          Willy occasionally blurts out mindless echoes of their
          argument, which Kirk and Stainer mostly ignore, like...
          
                              WILLY
                    He's hurting now!
          
                              STAINER
                    The longer this went on the worse it
                    would have been. I guarantee it!
          
                              KIRK
                    You don't know what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              WILLY
                    He does not know!
          
                              STAINER
                    Yes, I do, Kirk! I know exactly
                    what I'm talking about.
          
                                                                   87.
          
          
          
                              WILLY
                    Perhaps he does know after all!
          
                              STAINER
                    Remember last year when you hardly
                    saw me for about two months? I met
                    my own perfect ten. Tina Jordan.
                    Smart, cool and hot like you
                    wouldn't believe. Hotter than
                    Molly even.
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah right. So how come I never
                    heard a word about her until now?
          
                              WILLY
                    Yes, how come no word of this Tina!?
          
                              STAINER
                    I didn't tell anyone. I didn't
                    want to jinx it. She was perfect.
                    I was spilling over with...with
                    fucking happy! You know?
          
                              WILLY
                    Fucking happy!
          
                              STAINER
                    Two months into it, she dumps me.
                    And I knew it was coming. A girl
                    like that. Sooner or later she was
                    bound to get a better offer. But
                    it kicked my ass, man. I was
                    depressed for months.
          
                              KIRK
                    That's what that was? You said you
                    had that fatigue syndrome thing.
          
                              STAINER
                    I didn't want everyone knowing what
                    a pussy I was. Dude, it was a hurt
                    I can't even put into words.
          
                              WILLY
                    What a pussy.
          
                              STAINER
                    I couldn't watch you go through
                    that 'cause I love you, man.
                    You're the brother I never had.
          
          Stainer leans over and hugs Kirk.   Kirk doesn't hug back.
          
                                                                    88.

                    You have a brother, Stainer.
          
                              STAINER
                    Yeah, but he's a cheese-dick.
          
          Kirk's phone rings.    He answers, forcing Stainer to let go.

                    you. Listen son, I got something
                    to tell you and don't get mad at me
                    okay? 'Cause this thing ain't my

          Kirk slumps into a seat and listens, looking upset and
          shocked. Stainer stares at Kirk, trying to get a sense of
          what Kirk is being told.
          
                                 STAINER

          INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Patty sits behind a reception desk in a small but stylish
          lobby. A sign above her desk reads, "McCall Events." Kirk
          walks in. Patty puts down her work and stares back at him.
          
                              KIRK

                    No.     Get lost.
          
          Stainer bursts in sweating and panting.
          
                                                                      89.
          
          
          
                              PATTY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Christ sake! This one
                    too!?
          
          Patty comes out from behind her desk.
          
                              PATTY (CONT'D)
                    I'm warning you both - Molly has
                    been through enough. You go near
                    her and I will fuck you all the way
                    up! Understand!?
          
          Stainer swaggers up into Patty's face.
          
                              STAINER
                    Listen, bitch...
          
          WHACK!!! Patty throws an elbow and Stainer's head jacks
          back. She is instantly on him, grabbing him in a headlock
          and punching him in the face.
          
                               STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Ahhh!!   Jesus Christ!!! Kirk!!
          
                              PATTY
                    Who's your Mommy!?   Come on!   Who's
                    your Mommy!?
          
                               STAINER
                    You are!
          
                              PATTY
                    That's right! Patty is, isn't she!
          
                              KIRK
                    Patty! Cut it out! I just came to
                    tell her that something happened!
                    Something really major happened!
          
          Patty stops punching and looks up curiously.      Stainer remains
          in the headlock - also curious.
          
                              STAINER
                    What happened?
          
          Patty punches him again.
          
                              PATTY
                    You shut your hole! (to Kirk) What
                    happened?
          
                              KIRK
                    First off, I'm sorry.   Okay?
          
                                                                  90.
          
          
          
          Patty rams Stainer's head into the door.
          
                              PATTY
                    Every time you say you're sorry,
                    dumbshit here gets his bell rung.
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, okay! Sorry!     I just...
          
          Patty slams him again.
          
                               STAINER
                    Dude!   Stop apologizing!
          
                              KIRK
                    Look! I know I was acting like an
                    idiot. She's just so... Well, I
                    was really having a hard time with
                    everyone thinking I was Molly's
                    brother or her co-worker or her gay
                    friend or whatever. I mean, nobody
                    believed that we were together.
          
                              PATTY
                    It's too late for this shit, Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    But I've got it worked out now.
          
          Patty and Stainer wait for it. Kirk decides how to phrase it.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    My Grandmother left me three
                    million dollars.
          
                                 STAINER
                    Seriously?
          
          Patty drops Stainer on the floor.
          
                              PATTY
                    I thought she was a blackjack
                    dealer.
          
                              KIRK
                    It turns out she bought stock in
                    Caesars Palace back in the sixties.
                    Nobody knew she still had it. I
                    don't think she even knew.
          
                              PATTY
                    Wow. So, what does this have to do
                    with Molly?
          
                                                                     91.
          
          
          
                                KIRK
                    See?    Now it makes sense - me with
                    her.    I'm a millionaire now.
          
                              PATTY
                    So, what, now you can afford her!?
          
                              STAINER
                    No! No! I get it! It's not a
                    whore thing! Now it works out in
                    his own mind. Right!? He can
                    relax and stop acting like a freak
                    because now he's bringing something
                    to the table! Right, Kirky!?
          
                              KIRK
                    Right. Well, no. Now that you say
                    it out loud... I don't know.
          
                              PATTY
                    You know what, Kirk - I told Molly
                    you were different but you're just
                    as shallow and full of shit as the
                    rest of them, aren't you?
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, maybe I am.
          
          Kirk walks out.
          
                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY
          
          Stainer is at his post watching the luggage on the x-ray
          monitor. Suddenly, he sees Kirk coming through followed by
          Marnie, Mr. & Mrs. Kettner, Eric and Debbie (still pregnant).
          They are all wearing bright yellow sweatshirts. Stainer runs
          around the machine to hug Kirk, who looks a little numb.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirky! How you been, brother!?
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              KIRK
                    Me and Marnie and the family are
                    going to Branson. You know.
          
                              STAINER
                    So you're "Branson Bound."
          
          Stainer is referring to Kirk's shirt that reads, "BRANSON
          BOUND" in big letters.
          
                                                                   92.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                        (EMBARRASSED)
                    These were Marnie's idea. To make
                    it easy for us to stick together.
          
          The others come through. Their shirts are decorated likewise.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Come on, Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    I gotta go.
          
          Stainer takes the boarding pass from Kirk's hand.
          
                              STAINER
                    Relax, your flight doesn't leave
                    for another forty five minutes.
          
                              KIRK
                        (to Marnie)
                    I'll meet you guys down at the
                    gate, alright?
          
          Marnie isn't pleased but she's going along with it.   Eric
          calls back as they all head to the gate.
          
                              ERIC
                    Hey Stainer! Long time no see!
                    Take care, bro!
          
                              STAINER
                    Why is he so nice all of a sudden?
          
                              KIRK
                    Probably because I'm getting three
                    million dollars next week.
          
                              STAINER
                    Shit, that's right. (THEN) So
                    you're back with Marnie then, huh?
          
                              KIRK
                    Yeah, I know, but it's for the
                    best. I'm more secure with her.
                    I'm actually happy to be done with
                    all that Molly craziness.
          
          Ron comes through security and over to Kirk.
          
                                                                      93.
          
          
          
                              RON
                    Hey Stainer. Hey Pirate, can you
                    spot me a twenty. I want to get me
                    one of them travel pillows.
          
          Kirk gives Ron a twenty and Ron steps away.    Stainer is
          appalled. He calls after Ron.
          
                              STAINER
                    How come I'm not a pirate!? (then
                    to Kirk) Dude, do not tell me that
                    he's going with you guys.
          
                              KIRK
                    He already bought his ticket and my
                    dad likes him. It's no big deal.
          
                              STAINER
                    Look at me Big Slick.
          
          Kirk doesn't look into his eyes.
          
                              KIRK
                    What?
          
                              STAINER
                    Look at me.
          
          Kirk looks.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    Tell me things are good.
          
                              KIRK
                    Don't be such a drama queen.
                    Things are fine. I gotta go.
          
                               STAINER
                    Alright, man. It was good to see
                    you, Kirk.
          
          They exchange an awkward handshake. Kirk walks away.
          Stainer stands alone, watching him go.
          
          Stainer tightens his jaw and runs his fingers through his
          hair. Finally he kicks his head back and, with great
          determination, he stomps off in the opposite direction.
          
          Follow Stainer past security, dodging passengers and carts.
          He arrives at the...
          
                                                                    94.
          
          
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT
          
          Stainer marches up to the Orange Julius. A short, doughy,
          plain girl works the counter. (This is the same girl that
          Stainer had claimed to have "boned" earlier.) She's wearing
          an orange visor and rubber gloves. Several customers are
          waiting but Stainer moves to stand in front of her.
          
          She looks up from her smoothie.    She has drink powder on her
          face. She groans to see him.
          
                              TINA
                    Elmer, I've got customers here.
          
                              STAINER
                    Tina, I need to know right now why
                    it didn't work out with us.
          
          She hands a smoothie to a customer.
          
                              TINA
                    That's a large Julius.    Twelve
                    fifty.
          
                              STAINER
                    This is important. I was good to
                    you. I was sensitive, right?
          
                              MALE CUSTOMER
                    Hey, Desperado, you gonna order
                    something or what?
          
          Stainer gets in the customer's face.
          
                              STAINER
                    The fuck you just call me!?
          
                               TINA
                    Oh, for Christ's!     Tammy!   Can you
                    cover me!?
          
          INT. AIRPORT - SOUTHWEST GATE
          
          A large crowd of passengers are waiting to board.   The gate
          agent, makes an announcement.
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Okay folks, we're going to start by
                    boarding the A group. All A's are
                    now welcome to board.
          
          Marnie butts into the line.
          
                                                                 95.
          
          
          
                              MARNIE
                        (SNOTTY)
                    Look, I've got seven people in my
                    party so we're going to need to
                    board right away.
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Are you folks in the A group?
          
                              MARNIE
                    What difference does that make!?
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Well, because you seem like a
                    little bit of a B. May I see your
                    boarding pass?
          
                              MARNIE
                    Fine. We're not in the A group but
                    we're still getting on next.
          
          She hands him the pass - marked "C."
          
                              GATE AGENT
                    Oh, it looks like you're a raging
                    C. So, you're gonna want to take a
                    seat until your group is called.
          
          She stomps away.
          
          INT. AIRPORT FOOD COURT - LATER
          
          Stainer and Tina sit at a table. He sits with his head down
          like a sad little boy. She pities him.
          
                              TINA
                    I really liked you Elmer, but all
                    that stuff about me being a ten and
                    how lucky you were and always
                    checking up to see if I was going
                    to dump you...
          
                              STAINER
                    Well, you did dump me, so...
          
                              TINA
                    What could I do? You were all up
                    in my business all the time. I
                    couldn't breathe.
          
                              STAINER
                    It was my stupid job, wasn't it?
                    You were embarrassed.
          
                                                                  96.
          
          
          
                              TINA
                    I work at Orange Julius, Elmer! If
                    you would have just chilled out and
                    been yourself...
          
                              STAINER
                    Okay, I can do that.
          
          She holds up her finger with an engagement ring on it.
          Stainer drops his head onto the table. Tina rubs his hair
          for a second and then walks away.
          
          INT. AIRPLANE - 737 - EVENING
          
          Kirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the
          plane. From two rows back, Eric reaches over some other
          passengers to tap Kirk on the shoulder.
          
                              ERIC
                    Tom fuckin' Wopat, bro!
          
          Eric hangs up a high five and Kirk leaves it hanging. Kirk
          takes a seat on the aisle next to Marnie. He gives Marnie a
          forced smile. She puts her head on his shoulder. Pan over to
          the window seat where Ron sits watching them, wearing his new
          travel pillow.
          
          Suddenly, there is a commotion at the front of the plane.
          
                              FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    What!? You don't have authority on
                    board this aircraft!
          
          Stainer barges past the flight attendant, holding up his TSA
          badge.
          
                              STAINER
                    It's okay folks! TSA! This guy's
                    drunk as fuck and he shit himself.
                    We gotta get him off the plane.
          
          Stainer grabs Kirk by the shoulder, pulls him out of his seat
          and about two rows down the aisle before Kirk overpowers him
          and stops.
          
                               KIRK
                    Stainer!   What are you nuts!?
          
                              STAINER
                    You were right! I messed you up.
                    We gotta fix this thing! Let's go.
          
                                                                   97.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    Stainer! No! Believe it or not,
                    this isn't about you! In fact it's
                    none of your business!
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirky! In junior high I peed my
                    pants in class and Eric started
                    calling me Stainer, remember?
          
                              KIRK
                    Okay, yeah?
          
                              STAINER
                    Pretty soon everyone else started
                    calling me Stainer because they
                    knew it would make me cry. Then
                    you told me to own that name, to
                    call myself Stainer so nobody could
                    hurt me with it anymore.
          
                              KIRK
                    What's your point?
          
                              STAINER
                    My point is... um... Oh, shit. I
                    was just in the crapper and I had
                    this thing all worked out. Damn it.
          
          The pilot is now behind Stainer and towering over him.
          
                              PILOT
                    Sir, I'm going to have to ask you
                    to exit the aircraft immediately.
          
          Stainer turns into his face.
          
                              STAINER
                    I'm going to have to ask you to
                    fuck off immediately before I feed
                    you your own fuckin' teeth!
          
          The pilot backs up and goes for help.
          
                              KIRK
                    Jesus Stains! You're going to get
                    arrested! And I won't be here to
                    bail you out this time.
          
                              STAINER
                    Ooohh! That was my point! You
                    saved me! That time and a bunch of
                    other times too.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   98.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    You gotta let me save you this
                    time. It's my turn! Your grandma
                    didn't leave you three million
                    bucks so you could take these a-
                    holes to Branson.
          
          Eric gets up and steps into Stainer's face. In mid-sentence
          and without pausing Stainer zaps Eric with a stun gun. Eric
          sails back into his seat as Stainer continues.
          
                              STAINER (CONT'D)
                    These people hardly know you.
          
                              KIRK
                    Stainer, I appreciate that you
                    think you're helping me but I'm
                    with Marnie now.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk, Marnie's a fuckin' bitch.
                    (to Marnie) All due respect.
          
                              MARNIE
                    Hit him Kirk! Or else I will!
          
          Fuller and two other security people enter the plane.   The
          pilot briefs them on what's happening.
          
                              STAINER
                    Kirk! You said Marnie makes you feel
                    secure but security is bullshit!
                    Look at our jobs! It's all for show!
                    For all we know, there's a bomb on
                    this plane right now!
          
          The other passengers gasp and most of them look at Habib, who
          sits a few seats behind Kirk.
          
                              HABIB
                    What!?
          
          Fuller grabs Stainer by the collar.
          
                               STAINER
                    You want to see what I think of
                    security!?
          
          Stainer turns and punches Fuller in the face, knocking him
          backwards onto the other agents.
          
                              KIRK
                    Oh, Stainer, what did you do?
          
                                                                    99.
          
          
          
                                STAINER
                      Kirk! When I added all this up for
                      you I made one big mistake. You
                      are a ten. YOU'RE A TEN, MAN!
          
          Kirk just stares back. Fuller and the agents grab Stainer
          but he clutches a seat and stays put.
          
                                STAINER (CONT'D)
                      You're not buying any of this
                      bullshit are you?
          
                                 KIRK
                      No.
          
          Stainer loses his grip and the agents drag him off the plane.
          Kirk sits down and Marnie comforts him.
          
          INT. AIRPORT - EVENING
          
          Over a bummed out song we see different areas of the airport.
          People on moving sidewalks. People on escalators. Bags
          moving around on a carousel. People in line. Flight Arrival
          and Departure times. Food trays moving down a buffet. Bags
          moving by on the x-ray monitor. People walking like cattle
          to their gates. Through the crowd, we see a man running
          against the traffic. It's Kirk!
          
          INT. HILTON BALLROOM - NIGHT
          
          Molly,   looking beautiful in a formal gown, moves through a
          sea of   tables. Hundreds of formally dressed people are
          seated   around the tables, eating dinner. Molly greets,
          kisses   and shakes hands with several people as she goes.
          
          INT. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT
          
          Kirk is huffing and puffing as he rounds the corner and
          arrives at the checkpoint. He looks around frantically.
          
                                 KIRK
                      Randy!   Where's Stainer!?
          
          Randy points to a room marked, "Airport Security - Authorized
          Personnel Only."
          
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Kirk bursts in to find Stainer bent over a metal table.
          Fuller (with two black eyes) and another agent hold him down
          as a homeland security agent stands behind Stainer, giving
          him the full cavity search. Kirk doesn't miss a beat.
          
                                                                  100.
          
          
          
                               KIRK
                     Stainer! I don't have a car here!
                     I need your van!
          
                                 STAINER
                     Right on!    The keys are in my
                     jacket!
          
          A jacket is hanging by the door. Kirk reaches in and grabs
          the keys. He turns fast and exits. Fuller jacks Stainer's
          head onto the table.
          
                               STAINER (CONT'D)
                     Kirky wait!
          
          The door opens more slowly and Kirk regards his friend with
          great reverence. Stainer strains to lift his head against
          Fuller's strength.
          
                               STAINER (CONT'D)
                     Listen, Kirk. (dramatic pause and
                     music) It's three on the tree and
                     the clutch sticks.
          
          SLAM!   Stainer's head is jacked back onto the table.
          
                               KIRK
                     Thanks buddy!
          
          Kirk bolts.
          
          INT. HILTON - SMALL BANQUET ROOM
          
          This room is set up as a staging area for the cancer benefit.
          Patty and several others are buzzing around preparing for the
          next phase of the evening. Molly enters, holding a walkie
          talkie up to her head and speaking into it.
          
                               MOLLY
                     No, I need the staff ready to help
                     with bids when the auction begins.
                     - over.
          
                               VOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE
                     I don't think we can spare anyone -
                     over.
          
          Patty grabs the walkie talkie.
          
                               PATTY
                     Leslie! We're not here to feed

                     fucking cancer!

                              PATTY (CONT'D)
                    Now I want every one of those
                    motherfuckers back there taking
                    bids in fifteen - out!
          
          Patty tosses the walkie-talkie back and then crosses to help
          a group of young cancer patients, some in wheelchairs, to
          unpack their sculptures and label them for the auction.
          
          A stressed-out woman in a BEEHIVE hairdo picks up a SMALL
          BOY's sculpture. She hails Molly.
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    Ms. McCall, we've got a big problem.
          
                              MOLLY
                    What is it?
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    This young man has made an ashtray.
          
                             MOLLY
                    Okay. Well, what do you want from
                    me? Kids make ashtrays.
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    It's a cancer benefit. Don't you
                    think this sends the wrong message?
          
                              SMALL BOY
                    It's a really nice ashtray.
          
                              MOLLY
                    They're not bidding on the artwork;
                    they're bidding on the kids. It's
                    fine.
          
          Beehive sighs hard and hands the ashtray back to the boy.
          
          Molly turns around and a look of surprise comes over her.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing here!?
          
          Reverse to show Talon holding a ridiculously large flower
          arrangement.
          
                              TALON
                    I came to say I'm sorry and to put
                    in a request for a second chance.
          
                              VOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE
                    Ms. McCall, the auction is underway
                    - over.
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
          
                              MOLLY
                    I'm sorry. I have to get in there.
                    Can we talk about this afterwards?
          
                              TALON
                    I'm looking forward to it.
          
          INT. HILTON BALLROOM
          
          The emcee is taking bids on a little sculpture of an abstract
          four-legged animal.
          
                              EMCEE
                    Timothy Brigg's sculpture of a...
                    fire truck? Sold to the woman in
                    the green dress for four hundred
                    fifty dollars. Congratulations
                    ma'am and thanks so much.
          
          Molly picks up the small boy's ashtray and joins the emcee on
          stage. She takes a deep breath before facing the crowd.
          
                              EMCEE (CONT'D)
                    Our next item... Well, here she is
                    folks, the woman who donates her
                    time to make this amazing event
                    possible, our own Molly McCall!
          
          Huge applause.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Thank you. Thanks, Bob. I'm so
                    sorry for my tardiness. The next
                    item up for bids is from nine-year-
                    old Walter Benegan. And this is
                    a... little something that you can
                    put your paper clips or do-dads
                    in... Oh, who am I kidding, it's an
                    ashtray. (audience laughs) Let's
                    start the bidding at one hundred
                    dollars.
          
                              MAN
                    One hundred.
          
                              MOLLY
                    One hundred. Thank you sir.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Two hundred.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Two hundred to the...
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                                 MAN 2
                    Two Fifty.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Two seventy five.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Fantastic. Two-seventy-five.     Do I
                    hear three hundred?
          
          No replies. The small boy hangs his head. He was hoping his
          piece would fetch more. His mother pats him on the head.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Two Seventy Five going once.     Going
                    twice.
          
                              KIRK (O.S.)
                    Ten thousand dollars!
          
          The small boy looks up, elated. The spotlight searches the
          room and lands on Kirk near the back. The audience applauds.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk? I hope you don't really
                    think this is going to...
          
                              TALON
                    Eleven thousand!
          
          Talon stands across the room, crossing his arms in defiance.
          
                                 MOLLY
                    What!?
          
          Eric bursts in through a door near Kirk.
          
                              KIRK
                    Fifteen Thousand!
          
                              TALON
                    Fifteen thousand five hundred!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Both of you! This is ridiculous...
          
                              ERIC
                    Go get him Kirk! It's chump change
                    to you now.
          
                              KIRK
                    Twenty Thousand!
          
                                                                 104.
          
          
          
          The crowd applauds.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Is that a serious bid?
          
                              TALON
                    Fifty thousand dollars!
          
          Bigger applause.
          
                               MOLLY
                    Talon!   Please!
          
          Eric makes a fist to indicate that it's time for the killing
          blow. Kirk nods back his agreement.
          
                              KIRK
                    Three million dollars!
          
          Eric's eyes go wide. This is not what he had in mind. The
          crowd erupts into laughter. Talon also laughs off the bid.
          
                              MOLLY
                    Kirk, that's your entire
                    inheritance.
          
          The crowd shifts from laughter into excited chatter.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    Folks, calm down. I don't want to
                    get anyone's hopes up. It's only
                    fair that I clarify something to
                    the bidder. Kirk, please
                    understand that if you commit this
                    money, we will all be eternally
                    grateful and I think your
                    grandmother will be very proud of
                    you... But it doesn't change
                    anything between you and me.
          
          This sets off a volley of whispers among the crowd and puts a
          smile on Talon's face.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    So, again, is this a serious bid?
          
          Kirk looks to Molly, then his brother - who is shaking his
          head NO! He then scans the hopeful expressions on the faces
          of the kids and their parents. Kirk takes a deep breath.
          
                              KIRK
                    Three million dollars.
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          
                              ERIC
                    You stupid son of a bitch!
          
                              MOLLY
                    Three million going once. Going
                    twice. Sold to the man in the
                    Branson Bound sweatshirt.
          
          The crowd cheers.
          
                              EMCEE
                    Congratulations to little Walter
                    whose ashtray has brought in more
                    than any piece in our history.
          
          The young sculptor beams. The crowd cheers again. Kirk
          gives a smile and a nod of resignation as he leaves the room.
          
          INT. HILTON BAR
          
          Kirk and Eric sit at the bar, each nursing a drink.   Eric is
          fuming.
          
                              ERIC
                    You are such a numbnut. I am
                    telling you - absolute numbnuttery!
          
                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.     May I use that ashtray?
          
          Kirk turns to find that he is sitting next to BILLY JOEL, who
          is smoking a cigar. Eric passes him the ashtray that Kirk
          just bought.
          
                              ERIC
                    Sure. Careful with it there,
                    Captain Jack. It cost him three
                    million bucks.
          
          Billy Joel, ashes in the ashtray.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Yeah, I saw that. Tough break in
                    there, my friend. Still, that was
                    a hell of a good thing you did for
                    those kids.
          
                                 KIRK
                    Thanks.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Beautiful women huh? What are you
                    gonna do?
          
                                                                 106.
          
          
          
                              KIRK
                    I guess I'm going to go home.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    It's none of my business but I do
                    know a thing or two about hooking
                    up with women who are out of your
                    league. Can I tell you a little
                    secret?
          
          Kirk and Eric look at one another in disbelief and then at
          Joel.
          
                               KIRK
                    Sure.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Look, it's not about money, fame or
                    power...
          
                              ERIC
                    Whoa! All due respect there, Big
                    Shot. How would you know? You had
                    all that shit when you bagged the
                    big ones.
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Yeah, but I had all that shit when
                    I lost 'em too. It's not enough.
          
                              ERIC
                    You believe this fuckin' guy?
          
                              KIRK
                    Jesus Christ, Eric! I'm trying to
                    get some advice from Billy Joel.
                    Do you think you could manage to
                    shut the fuck up for two minutes!?
          
                               ERIC
                    Fine.   Geeze. What's up your ass?
          
                              BILLY JOEL
                    Thank you. Look kid, it's not what
                    you can give 'em or even what you
                    can give up. It's what your made
                    of.
          
          Joel places a cocktail in front of Kirk and then clinks his
          own against it.
          
                                                                  107.
          
          
          
          INT. HILTON BALLROOM - LATER
          
                              ANNOUNCER
                    Ladies and gentlemen, please
                    welcome The Piano Man! The
                    Entertainer! And our foundation's
                    greatest champion! Mr. Billy Joel!
          
          The crowd cheers as the curtain rises.   The crowd's
          excitement turns to confusion.
          
          From the back of the room, Molly notices the crowd's
          reaction. She turns to see Kirk seated before the huge white
          grand piano, his hands sweaty and shaking over the keys.
          
          Kirk looks at the crowd.   Hundreds of confused faces stare
          back at him.
          
          Beehive rushes Patty in a panic.
          
                              BEEHIVE
                    Aren't you going to do something
                    about this!?
          
                              PATTY
                    Lady, he just gave three million
                    dollars. He can go up there and
                    try to blow himself for all I care.
          
          Kirk wrings his hands as they shake harder.
          
          Billy Joel stands in the wings and gives Kirk a nod of, "You
          can do it."
          
          Molly turns to walk away but notes ring out from the piano
          and she stops.
          
          Kirk plays and sings "Just the Way You Are" - badly. His
          voice and hands shake but he forges on. The audience is
          confused, cringing and restless.
          
          Someone starts booing.   Kirk can't help but glance up to see
          who it is - it's Eric.
          
          When Kirk reaches the instrumental break, he settles in a bit
          - he can actually play.
          
          As the last note fades, Kirk leaps up, and runs out into
          the...
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          
          EXT. HILTON BACK ALLEY
          
          Kirk bursts out the door and vomits into a dumpster. He
          falls backwards against the wall and slides down into a
          sitting position.
          
                              MOLLY (O.S.)
                    You realize that there's a good
                    chance this won't work out.
          
          Molly steps out into the alley.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    And you could get hurt.
          
                                KIRK
                    I know.
          
                              MOLLY
                    And you're going to have to be
                    naked in front of me at some point.
          
                              KIRK
                    I can work up to that.
          
          Kirk stands up.
          
                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                    So, you and me are...
          
                              MOLLY
                    Three million dollars for kids with
                    cancer and you sing to me? I'm not
                    made of wood you know.
          
          Molly hugs him. The first intro riff of a piano version of
          "Pressure" kicks in and the crowd inside goes crazy.
          
                              MOLLY (CONT'D)
                    But one condition.
          
                                KIRK
                    Anything.
          
                               MOLLY
                    You have to go brush your teeth
                    right now.
          
          Talon walks out into the alley, still holding the flowers.
          
                              TALON
                    So, Molly... Can we finish our
                    conversation?
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
          
          Kirk takes Molly's hand and leads her past Talon.
          
                              KIRK
                    Sorry Poncho, she's with me.
          
                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. WEDDING - DAY
          
          Close on a preacher.
          
                              PREACHER
                    The vows you have just heard are a
                    unique expression of the love
                    between two souls.
          
          Close on Kirk - looking dapper but sweaty and nervous.
          
                              PREACHER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Two souls who have come together
                    this day in holy matrimony.
          
          Close on Molly - looking more beautiful than ever.
          
                              PREACHER (CONT'D)
                    And by the power vested in me by
                    the great state of Nevada, I now
                    pronounce you husband and wife.
                    You may now...
          
          A wider shot reveals the NASCAR theme wedding of Eric and
          Debbie. Kirk stands among the groomsmen. Each are dressed
          in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of
          certain drivers. Molly stands among the bridesmaids. Each
          dressed in a checkered-flag gown. Ron and Marnie are also in
          the wedding party.
          
          Debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and
          Eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss. Debbie
          grabs Eric's ass while Eric gropes her breasts.
          
          Stainer and Wheel in the Sky kick into "Any Way You Want It"
          from a bandstand nearby. Patty dances in front of Stainer -
          he winks back at her.
          
          Devon cuts up a wedding cake that looks like a full-sized
          racing wheel and tire.
          
          EXT. WEDDING - STREET
          
          The guests throw rice as Eric and Debbie run to a stretch
          Nascar limo.
          
                                                                 110.
          
          
          Eric picks up Debbie and loads her in through the window.   He
          then runs around to the other side and jumps into that
          window. The limo burns rubber as it peels away.
          
          Pan across the guests as they wave goodbye; Devon and his
          squeaky clean family, Jack and a hot date, Mr. & Mrs.
          Kettner, Marnie & Ron. Patty and Stainer - making out. Kirk
          and Molly stand together arm in arm. Kirk holds a ceramic
          urn, painted with the Las Vegas skyline.
          
          Push in on the urn until the skyline becomes real. Push in
          toward the top of The Stratosphere Casino. Continue pushing
          in until we are inside the observation deck. Push through
          the gift shop where the TV is tuned to CNN. As we pass the
          TV we hear.
          
                              CNN ANCHOR
                    In a press conference held earlier
                    today, NASA officials announced
                    that affordable tourist travel to
                    the surface of the moon will be a
                    reality within the next ten to
                    fifteen years.
          
          Push past the TV, out of the gift shop and to the other side
          of the observation deck where we find Kirk and Molly. They
          kiss before they open the urn and pour Grammy's ashes over
          the side.
          
          
                                    THE END

                                     SHREK
                         Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
 
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               after the ogre.
 
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               quickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
                         you that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
                         work, your breath certainly will get 
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely 
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned 
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the 
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking 
                         out of my butt that day.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's 
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
                         faith...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
                         have any friends.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
                         cruelly honest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
                         me. What am I?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
                         tall?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
                         bother you?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, 
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
                         in place like that?
 
                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
                         You know you are quite a decorator. 
                         It's amazing what you've done with such 
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
                         don't entertain much, do you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing 
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when 
                         you got somebody in your face. You've 
                         trying to give them a hint, and they 
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
                         You don't know what it's like to be 
                         considered a freak. (pause while he 
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. 
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
                         a chair.) No! No!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
                         I don't know you, and you don't know 
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you 
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
                         no one here beside me...
 
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               noise. He stands up with a huff.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
                         stay outside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
 
                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
                         farm, but what choice do we have?
 
                         
                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
 
                         
                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
                         and lands on his shoulder.)
 
                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
                         ear)
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) 
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.
 
                         
                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The 
                         bed's taken.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               him.
 
                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
               him to the front door.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and 
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy 
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
                         no. No! No!
 
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)
 
                         
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
               tent.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, 
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
                         look at Donkey)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
                         them.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
                         this Farquaad guy is?
 
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find 
                         him? Anyone at all?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
                         Me, me!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. 
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
                         right now and get you all off my land 
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. 
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
                         You! You're comin' with me.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, 
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
                         adventure. I love it!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
                         on the road again.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.
 
                         
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch 
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         You are a monster.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
                         me! Where are the others?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
                         eye.)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
                         Now my patience has reached its end! 
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
                         buttons.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
                         muffin man?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
                         on Drury Lane?
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Well, she's married to the muffin man.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         The muffin man?

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         The muffin man!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         She's married to the muffin man.

               The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         My lord! We found it.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
                         it in.
 
               More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               Mirror.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         (in awe) Ohhhh...

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Magic mirror...

                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
                         him up and dumps him into a trash can 
                         with a lid.) No!

                         Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
                         Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
                         of them all?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         Well, technically you're not a king.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
                         hand mirror and smashes it with his 
                         fist.) You were saying?
 
                                     MIRROR
                         What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
                         But you can become one. All you have 
                         to do is marry a princess.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Go on.

                         (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
                         and relax, my lord, because it's time 
                         for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
                         And here they are! Bachelorette number 
                         one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
                         a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
                         and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
                         include cooking and cleaning for her 
                         two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
                         (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
                         number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
                         the land of fancy. Although she lives 
                         with seven other men, she's not easy. 
                         Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
                         find out what a live wire she is. Come 
                         on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
                         picture of Snow White) And last, but 
                         certainly not last, bachelorette number 
                         three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
                         castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
                         But don't let that cool you off. She's 
                         a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
                         and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
                         for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
                         picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
                         be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
                         number two or bachelorette number three?

                         Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
                         Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
                         have to do is just find someone who 
                         can go...

                         But I probably should mention the little 
                         thing that happens at night.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll do it.

                                     MIRROR
                         Yes, but after sunset...

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
                         my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
                         the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
                         your finest men. We're going to have 
                         a tournament. (smiles evilly)
 
               DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section

               Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
               lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But that's it. That's it right there. 
                         That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-huh. That's the place.

                                     SHREK
                         Do you think maybe he's compensating 
                         for something? (He laughs, but then 
                         groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
                         He continues walking through the parking 
                         lot.)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

                                     MAN
                         Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
                         a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
                         screams and begins running through the 
                         rows of rope to get to the front gate 
                         to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
                         Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
                         - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
                         walking straight through the rows. The 
                         attendant runs into a wall and falls 
                         down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
                         continue on into DuLoc.)
 
               DULOC

               They look around but all is quiet.

                                     SHREK
                         It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, look at this!

               Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
               marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
               open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
               to sing.
 
                                     WOODEN PEOPLE
                         Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
 
                         
               Here we have some rules

               Let us lay them down

               Don't make waves, stay in line

               And we'll get along fine

               DuLoc is perfect place

               Please keep off of the grass

               Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

               DuLoc is, DuLoc is

               DuLoc is perfect place.

               Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.

                                     DONKEY
                         Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
                         to run over and pull the lever again)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
                         No. No. No, no, no! No.
 
               They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Brave knights. You are the best and 
                         brightest in all the land. Today one 
                         of you shall prove himself...
 
               As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
               Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right. You're going the right way 
                         for a smacked bottom.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Sorry about that.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         That champion shall have the honor - 
                         - no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
                         and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
                         from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
                         for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
                         the first runner-up will take his place 
                         and so on and so forth. Some of you 
                         may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
                         to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
                         begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
                         that? It's hideous!
 
                                     SHREK
                         (turns to look at Donkey and then back 
                         at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
                         It's just a donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
                         kills the ogre will be named champion! 
                         Have it him!
 
                                     MEN
                         Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
                         into a table where there are mugs of 
                         beer)
 
                                     CROWD
                         Go ahead! Get him!

                                     SHREK
                         (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
                         settle this over a pint?
 
                                     CROWD
                         Kill the beast!

                                     SHREK
                         No? All right then. (drinks the beer) 
                         Come on!
 
               He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
               of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
               other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
               past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
               As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
               beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
               Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
               fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
               to say that Shrek kicks butt.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

               Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
               gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah!

               A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
               and sees him.
 
                                     WOMAN
                         The chair! Give him the chair!

               Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
               are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
               sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
                         very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
                         the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
 
               The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on 
               Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Shall I give the order, sir?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         No, I have a better idea. People of 
                         DuLoc, I give you our champion!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Congratulations, ogre. You're won the 
                         honor of embarking on a great and noble 
                         quest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest 
                         to get my swamp back.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Your swamp?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those 
                         fairy tale creatures!
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you 
                         a deal. Go on this quest for me, and 
                         I'll give you your swamp back.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Exactly the way it was?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         And the squatters?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         As good as gone.

                                     SHREK
                         What kind of quest?

               Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
               heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Let me get this straight. You're gonna 
                         go fight a dragon and rescue a princess 
                         just so Farquaad will give you back 
                         a swamp which you only don't have because 
                         he filled it full of freaks in the first 
                         place. Is that about right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, maybe there's a good reason 
                         donkeys shouldn't talk.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't get it. Why don't you just pull 
                         some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle 
                         him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
                         his bones to make your bread, the whole 
                         ogre trip.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have 
                         decapitated an entire village and put 
                         their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
                         cut open their spleen and drink their 
                         fluids. Does that sound good to you?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, no, not really, no.

                                     SHREK
                         For your information, there's a lot 
                         more to ogres than people think.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Example?

                                     SHREK
                         Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
                         (he holds out his onion)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs the onion) They stink?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes - - No!

                                     DONKEY
                         They make you cry?

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         You leave them in the sun, they get 
                         all brown, start sproutin' little white 
                         hairs.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres 
                         have layers! Onions have layers. You 
                         get it? We both have layers. (he heaves 
                         a sigh and then walks off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both 
                         have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, 
                         not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody 
                         loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't care... what everyone likes. 
                         Ogres are not like cakes.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what else everybody likes? 
                         Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, 
                         you say, "Let's get some parfait," they 
                         say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? 
                         Parfaits are delicious.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! You dense, irritating, miniature 
                         beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! 
                         And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Parfaits may be the most delicious thing 
                         on the whole damn planet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, I think I preferred your humming.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
                         making a mess. Just the word parfait 
                         make me start slobbering.
 
               They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
               a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
               to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
               so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
 
               DRAGON'S KEEP

               Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
               house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
                         You gotta warn somebody before you just 
                         crack one off. My mouth was open and 
                         everything.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
                         be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We 
                         must be getting close.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
                         about it's the brimstone. I know what 
                         I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
                         didn't come off no stone neither.
 
                         
               They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
               is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
               the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
               foreboding.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
                         location. (laughs...then the laugh turns 
                         into a groan)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
                         ogres have layers?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, aye.

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
                         make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
                         wear our fear right out there on our 
                         sleeves.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what I mean.

                                     SHREK
                         You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
                         about being on a rickety bridge over 
                         a boiling like of lava!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
                         ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
                         just tackle this thing together one 
                         little baby step at a time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Just keep moving. And don't look down.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
                         Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
                         look down. (he steps through a rotting 
                         board and ends up looking straight down 
                         into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
                         Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
                         off, please!
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you're already halfway.

                                     DONKEY
                         But I know that half is safe!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
                         You go back.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, no! Wait!

                                     SHREK
                         Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance 
                         then, shall me? (bounces and sways the 
                         bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't do that!

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces 
                         the bridge again)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, that!

                                     SHREK
                         Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to 
                         bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
                         the bridge)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

                                     SHREK
                         You said do it! I'm doin' it.

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
                         I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) 
                         Oh!
 
                                     SHREK
                         That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks 
                         towards the castle)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. So where is this fire-breathing 
                         pain-in-the-neck anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
                         (chuckles)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
 
                         
               INSIDE THE CASTLE

                                     DONKEY
                         You afraid?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         But...

                                     SHREK
                         Shh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton 
                         and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
                         with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
                         response to an unfamiliar situation. 
                         Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
                         add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
                         and eats knights and breathes fire, 
                         it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
                         if you're a little scared. I sure as 
                         heck ain't no coward. I know that.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
                         Now go over there and see if you can 
                         find any stairs.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (putting on a helmet) The princess will 
                         be up the stairs in the highest room 
                         in the tallest tower.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What makes you think she'll be there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I read it in a book once. (walks off)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle 
                         the stairs. I'll find those stairs. 
                         I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs 
                         won't know which way they're goin'. 
                         (walks off)
 
               EMPTY ROOM

               Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it 
                         to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm 
                         the stair master. I've mastered the 
                         stairs. I wish I had a step right here. 
                         I'd step all over it.
 
               ELSEWHERE

               Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.

                                     SHREK
                         Well, at least we know where the princess 
                         is, but where's the...
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Dragon!

               Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
               Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
               breathes fire.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, look out! (he manages to get 
                         a hold of the dragons tail and holds 
                         on) Got ya!
 
               The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek 
               goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the 
               tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying 
               on the floor.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Aah! Aah!

               Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small 
               part of the bridge he's on.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, 
                         what large teeth you have. (the dragon 
                         growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. 
                         I know you probably hear this all time 
                         from your food, but you must bleach, 
                         'cause that is one dazzling smile you 
                         got there. Do I detect a hint of minty 
                         freshness? And you know what else? You're 
                         - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! 
                         I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
                         You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 
                         (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes 
                         at him) What's the matter with you? 
                         You got something in your eye? Ohh. 
                         Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, 
                         but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon 
                         blows a smoke ring in the shape of a 
                         heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm 
                         an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd 
                         work out if you're gonna blow smoke 
                         rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him 
                         up with her teeth and carries him off) 
                         No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
 
               FIONA'S ROOM

               Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
               so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
               then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
               the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
               Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
               a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
               and shakes her away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Oh! Oh!

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up!

                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         Are you Princess Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

                                     FIONA
                         But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our 
                         first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, 
                         romantic moment?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should 
                         sweep me off my feet out yonder window 
                         and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         You've had a lot of time to plan this, 
                         haven't you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) Mm-hmm.

               Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down 
               the hallway.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But we have to savor this moment! You 
                         could recite an epic poem for me. A 
                         ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         I don't think so.

                                     FIONA
                         Can I at least know the name of my champion?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     FIONA
                         Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds 
                         out a handkerchief) I pray that you 
                         take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Thanks!

               Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.

                                     FIONA
                         (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         It's on my to-do list. Now come on! 
                         (takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
                         him.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         But this isn't right! You were meant 
                         to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
                         That's what all the other knights did.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, right before they burst into flame.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly 
                         stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek 
                         ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
                         off to the side.) Wait. Where are you 
                         going? The exit's over there.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I have to save my ass.

                                     FIONA
                         What kind of knight are you?

                                     SHREK
                         One of a kind. (opens the door into 
                         the throne room)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
                         I believe it's healthy to get to know 
                         someone over a long period of time. 
                         Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs 
                         worriedly) (we see him up close and 
                         from a distance as Shrek sneaks into 
                         the room) I don't want to rush into 
                         a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally 
                         ready for a commitment of, uh, this 
                         - - Magnitude really is the word I'm 
                         looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that 
                         is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what 
                         are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just 
                         back up a little and take this one step 
                         at a time. We really should get to know 
                         each other first as friends or pen pals. 
                         I'm on the road a lot, but I just love 
                         receiving cards - - I'd really love 
                         to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's 
                         my tail! That's my personal tail. You're 
                         gonna tear it off. I don't give permission 
                         - - What are you gonna do with that? 
                         Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. 
                         No, no, no. No! Oh!
 
               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings 
               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks 
               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. 
               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps 
               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. 
               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and 
               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto 
               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms 
               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey 
               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and 
               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hi, Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         It talks!

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's 
                         the trick.
 
               They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots 
               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a 
               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His 
               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles 
               off and walks lightly.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

               Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll 
                         take care of the dragon.
 
               Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the 
               castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping 
               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that 
               is still around the dragons neck.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (echoing) Run!

               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot 
               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons 
               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on 
               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They 
               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look 
               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to 
               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the 
               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs 
               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a 
               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You 
                         did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. 
                         (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) 
                         You're - - You're wonderful. You're... 
                         (turns and sees Shrek fall down the 
                         hill and bump into Donkey) a little 
                         unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed 
                         is great, and thy heart is pure. I am 
                         eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears 
                         his throat.) And where would a brave 
                         knight be without his noble steed?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I hope you heard that. She called me 
                         a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         The battle is won. You may remove your 
                         helmet, good Sir Knight.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, no.

                                     FIONA
                         Why not?

                                     SHREK
                         I have helmet hair.

                                     FIONA
                         Please. I would'st look upon the face 
                         of my rescuer.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

                                     FIONA
                         But how will you kiss me?

                                     SHREK
                         What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the 
                         job description.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Maybe it's a perk.

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know 
                         how it goes. A princess locked in a 
                         tower and beset by a dragon is rescued 
                         by a brave knight, and then they share 
                         true love's first kiss.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. 
                         Wait. You think that Shrek is you true 
                         love?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes.

               Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.

                                     DONKEY
                         You think Shrek is your true love!
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         What is so funny?

                                     SHREK
                         Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: 
                         Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. 
                         Now - - Now remove your helmet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look. I really don't think this is a 
                         good idea.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Just take off the helmet.

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not going to.

                                     FIONA
                         Take it off.

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FIONA
                         Now!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. 
                         (takes off his helmet)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You- - You're a- - an ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is 
                         all wrong. You're not supposed to be 
                         an ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Princess, I was sent to rescue you by 
                         Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who 
                         wants to marry you.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Then why didn't he come rescue me?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Good question. You should ask him that 
                         when we get there.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But I have to be rescued by my true 
                         love, not by some ogre and his- - his 
                         pet.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, so much for noble steed.

                                     SHREK
                         You're not making my job any easier.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
                         You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he 
                         wants to rescue me properly, I'll be 
                         waiting for him right here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all 
                         right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. 
                         (he swiftly picks her up and swings 
                         her over his shoulder like she was a 
                         sack of potatoes)
 
                                     FIONA
                         You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

                                     SHREK
                         Ya comin', Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'm right behind ya.

                                     FIONA
                         Put me down, or you will suffer the 
                         consequences! This is not dignified! 
                         Put me down!
 
               WOODS

               A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just 
               hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, so here's another question. Say 
                         there's a woman that digs you, right, 
                         but you don't really like her that way. 
                         How do you let her down real easy so 
                         her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't 
                         get burned to a crisp and eaten?
 
                                     FIONA
                         You just tell her she's not your true 
                         love. Everyone knows what happens when 
                         you find your...(Shrek drops her on 
                         the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to 
                         DuLoc the better.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
                         It's beautiful!
 
                                     FIONA
                         And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? 
                         What's he like?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Let me put it this way, Princess. Men 
                         of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
                         (he and Donkey laugh)
 
               Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off 
               the dust and grime.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I don't know. There are those who think 
                         little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: 
                         Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're 
                         just jealous you can never measure up 
                         to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. 
                         But I'll let you do the "measuring" 
                         when you see him tomorrow.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? 
                         It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop 
                         to make camp?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, that'll take longer. We can keep 
                         going.
 
                                     FIONA
                         But there's robbers in the woods.

                                     DONKEY
                         Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting 
                         to sound good.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything 
                         we're going to see in this forest.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I need to find somewhere to camp now!
 
                         
               Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
 
               
               MOUNTAIN CLIFF

               Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves 
               a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! Over here.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, we can do better than that. I 
                         don't think this is fit for a princess.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         No, no, it's perfect. It just needs 
                         a few homey touches.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Homey touches? Like what? (he hears 
                         a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona 
                         who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee 
                         good night. (goes into the cave and 
                         puts the bark door up behind her)
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         You want me to read you a bedtime story? 
                         I will.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (os) I said good night!

               Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the 
               boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona 
               still inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, What are you doing?

                                     SHREK
                         (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, 
                         come on. I was just kidding.
 
               LATER THAT NIGHT

               Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring 
               up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations 
               to Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, 
                         the only ogre to ever spit over three 
                         wheat fields.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future 
                         from these stars?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
                         They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, 
                         the Flatulent. You can guess what he's 
                         famous for.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I know you're making this up.

                                     SHREK
                         No, look. There he is, and there's the 
                         group of hunters running away from his 
                         stench.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little 
                         dots.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, Donkey, sometimes things are 
                         more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what 
                         we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Our swamp?

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, when we're through rescuing 
                         the princess.
 
                                     SHREK
                         We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's 
                         no "our". There's just me and my swamp. 
                         The first thing I'm gonna do is build 
                         a ten-foot wall around my land.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real 
                         deep just now. You know what I think? 
                         I think this whole wall thing is just 
                         a way to keep somebody out.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, do ya think?

                                     DONKEY
                         Are you hidin' something?

                                     SHREK
                         Never mind, Donkey.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, this is another one of those onion 
                         things, isn't it?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, this is one of those drop-it and 
                         leave-it alone things.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Why don't you want to talk about it?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Why do you want to talk about it?

                                     DONKEY
                         Why are you blocking?

                                     SHREK
                         I'm not blocking.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, yes, you are.

                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm warning you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Who you trying to keep out?

                                     SHREK
                         Everyone! Okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
                         (grins)
 
               At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to 
               the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and 
                         walks over to the edge of the cliff 
                         and sits down)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What's your problem? What you got against 
                         the whole world anyway?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Look, I'm not the one with the problem, 
                         okay? It's the world that seems to have 
                         a problem with me. People take one look 
                         at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before 
                         they even know me. That's why I'm better 
                         off alone.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You know what? When we met, I didn't 
                         think you was just a big, stupid, ugly 
                         ogre.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     DONKEY
                         So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small 
                         and Annoying.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny 
                         one, right there. That one there?
 
                         
               Fiona puts the door back.

                                     SHREK
                         That's the moon.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, okay.

               DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom

               The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays 
               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic 
               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, 
                         show her to me. Show me the princess.
 
                         
                                     MIRROR
                         Hmph.

               The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ah. Perfect.

               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up 
               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly 
               at her image in the mirror.
 
               MORNING

               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey 
               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes 
               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along 
               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles 
               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too 
               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but 
               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona 
               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still 
               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking 
               in his sleep.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like 
                         it like that. Come on, baby. I said 
                         I like it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

                                     DONKEY
                         Huh? What?

                                     SHREK
                         Wake up.

                                     DONKEY
                         What? (stretches and yawns)

                                     FIONA
                         Good morning. Hm, how do you like your 
                         eggs?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, good morning, Princess!

               Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.

                                     SHREK
                         What's all this about?

                                     FIONA
                         You know, we kind of got off to a bad 
                         start yesterday. I wanted to make it 
                         up to you. I mean, after all, you did 
                         rescue me.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, thanks.

               Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.

                                     FIONA
                         Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead 
                         of us. (walks off)
 
               LATER

               They are once again on their way. They are walking through the 
               forest. Shrek belches.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         What? It's a compliment. Better out 
                         than in, I always say. (laughs)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Well, it's no way to behave in front 
                         of a princess.
 
               Fiona belches

                                     FIONA
                         Thanks.

                                     DONKEY
                         She's as nasty as you are.

                                     SHREK
                         (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly 
                         what I expected.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
                         before you get to know them.
 
               She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly 
               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into 
               a tree.
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         La liberte! Hey!

                                     SHREK
                         Princess!

                                     FIONA
                         (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! 
                         And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses 
                         up her arm while Fiona pulls back in 
                         disgust)...beast.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Hey! That's my princess! Go find you 
                         own!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a 
                         little busy here?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't 
                         know who you think you are!
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please 
                         let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. 
                         (laughs)
 
               Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out 
               from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I steal from the rich and give to the 
                         needy.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He takes a wee percentage,

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty 
                         damsels, man, I'm good.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Break it down. I like an honest fight 
                         and a saucy little maid...
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         What he's basically saying is he likes 
                         to get...
 
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush 
                         grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
 
                         
                                     MERRY MEN
                         That's bad.

                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         When a beauty's with a beast it makes 
                         me awfully mad.
 
                                     MERRY MEN
                         He's mad, he's really, really mad.
 
                         
                                     ROBIN HOOD
                         I'll take my blade and ram it through 
                         your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 
                         'cause I'm about to start...
 
               There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and 
               knocks Robin Hood unconscious.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Man, that was annoying!

               Shrek looks at her in admiration.

                                     MERRY MAN
                         Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at 
                         Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
 
                         
               The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to 
               get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.
 
               
               Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and 
               then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is 
               a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in 
               mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, 
               and Fiona begins walking away.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, shall we?

                                     SHREK
                         Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins 
                         walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, 
                         whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come 
                         from?
 
                                     FIONA
                         What?

                                     SHREK
                         That! Back there. That was amazing! 
                         Where did you learn that?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, 
                         uh, one has to learn these things in 
                         case there's a...(gasps and points) 
                         there's an arrow in your butt!
 
                                     SHREK
                         What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you 
                         look at that? (he goes to pull it out 
                         but flinches because it's tender)
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so 
                         sorry.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (walking up) Why? What's wrong?

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek's hurt.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, 
                         Shrek's gonna die.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey, I'm okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm 
                         too young for you to die. Keep you legs 
                         elevated. Turn your head and cough. 
                         Does anyone know the Heimlich?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help 
                         Shrek, run into the woods and find me 
                         a blue flower with red thorns.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on 
                         it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die 
                         Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay 
                         away from the light!
 
                                     SHREK & FIONA
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. 
                         (runs off)
 
                                     SHREK
                         What are the flowers for?

                                     FIONA
                         (like it's obvious) For getting rid 
                         of Donkey.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ah.

                                     FIONA
                         Now you hold still, and I'll yank this 
                         thing out. (gives the arrow a little 
                         pull)
 
                                     SHREK
                         (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the 
                         yankin'.
 
               As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and 
               Shrek keeps dodging her hands.
 
                                     FIONA
                         I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         No, it's tender.

                                     FIONA
                         Now, hold on.

                                     SHREK
                         What you're doing is the opposite of 
                         help.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Don't move.

                                     SHREK
                         Look, time out.

                                     FIONA
                         Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his 
                         hand over her face to stop her from 
                         getting at the arrow) Okay. What do 
                         you propose we do?
 
               ELSEWHERE

               Donkey is still looking for the special flower.

                                     DONKEY
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, 
                         red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. 
                         This would be so much easier if I wasn't

                         flower off a nearby bush that just happens 
                         to be a blue flower with red thorns)

                         Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. 
                         (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just 
                         about...

                         Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall 
                         over with Fiona on top of him)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ahem.

                                     DONKEY
                         Look, if you wanted to be alone, all 
                         you had to do was ask. Okay?

                         Oh, come on! That's the last thing on 
                         my mind. The princess here was just- 
                         - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he 
                         turns to look at Fiona who holds up 
                         the arrow with a smile) Ow!

                         That's...is that blood?
 
               Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue 
               on their way.
 
               There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. 
               Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a 
               small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as 
               Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back 
               into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting 
               and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb 
               that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it 
               around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins 
               eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. 
               Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting 
               it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning 
               it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group 
               arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.

                         Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks 
                         Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, 
                         which I think means he has a really...(Shrek 
                         steps on his hoof) Ow!

                         Um, I, uh- - I guess we better move 
                         on.

                         Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried 
                         about Donkey.

                         I mean, look at him. He doesn't look 
                         so good.

                                     FIONA
                         (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's 
                         what they always say, and then next 
                         thing you know, you're on your back. 
                         (pause) Dead.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You know, she's right. You look awful. 
                         Do you want to sit down?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         I didn't want to say nothin', but I 
                         got this twinge in my neck, and when 
                         I turn my head like this, look, (turns 
                         his neck in a very sharp way until his 
                         head is completely sideways) Ow! See?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         I'll get the firewood.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't 
                         feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) 
                         I don't have any toes! I think I need 
                         a hug.
 
               SUNSET

               Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while 
               Fiona eats.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Mmm. This is good. This is really good. 
                         What is this?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

                                     FIONA
                         No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, they're also great in stews. Now, 
                         I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean 
                         weed rat stew. (chuckles)
 
               Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs.

                                     FIONA
                         I guess I'll be dining a little differently 
                         tomorrow night.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp 
                         sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff 
                         for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare 
                         - - you name it.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I'd like that.

               They smiles at each other.

                                     SHREK
                         Um, Princess?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) 
                         Are you gonna eat that?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? 
                         Just look at that sunset.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (jumps up) Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's 
                         late. I-It's very late.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     DONKEY
                         Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on 
                         here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't 
                         you?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. 
                         You know, I'd better go inside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to 
                         be afraid of the dark, too, until - 
                         - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of 
                         the dark.
 
               Shrek sighs

                                     FIONA
                         Good night.

                                     SHREK
                         Good night.

               Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks 
               at Shrek with a new eye.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on 
                         here.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, what are you talkin' about?

                                     DONKEY
                         I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm 
                         an animal, and I got instincts. And 
                         I know you two were diggin' on each 
                         other. I could feel it.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You're crazy. I'm just bringing her 
                         back to Farquaad.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell 
                         the pheromones. Just go on in and tell 
                         her how you feel.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, 
                         even if I did tell her that, well, you 
                         know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause 
                         I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm 
                         - -
 
                                     DONKEY
                         An ogre?

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. An ogre.

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, where you goin'?

                                     SHREK
                         To get... move firewood. (sighs)

               Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already 
               is.
 
               TIME LAPSE

               Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is 
               nowhere to be seen.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, 
                         where are you? Princess?
 
               Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.
 
               
                                     DONKEY
                         It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing 
                         no games.
 
               Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't 
               look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking 
               out.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                                     FIONA
                         Oh, no!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, help!

                                     FIONA
                         Shh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

                                     FIONA
                         No, it's okay. It's okay.

                                     DONKEY
                         What did you do with the princess?
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey, I'm the princess.

                                     DONKEY
                         Aah!

                                     FIONA
                         It's me, in this body.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to 
                         her stomach) Can you hear me?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, 
                         keep breathing! I'll get you out of 
                         there!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No!

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

                                     FIONA
                         Shh.

                         Shrek!

                         This is me.

               Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets 
               down.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Princess? What happened to you? You're, 
                         uh, uh, uh, different.

                         I'm ugly, okay?

                                     DONKEY
                         Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 
                         'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a 
                         bad idea. You are what you eat, I said.

                         No. I - - I've been this way as long 
                         as I can remember.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What do you mean? Look, I ain't never 
                         seen you like this before.

                         It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little 
                         girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every 
                         night I become this. This horrible, 
                         ugly beast! I was placed in a tower 
                         to await the day my true love would 
                         rescue me. That's why I have to marry 
                         Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun 
                         sets and he sees me like this. (begins

                         All right, all right. Calm down. Look, 
                         it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. 
                         Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. 
                         But you only look like this at night.

                                     FIONA
                         I have to. Only my true love's kiss 
                         can break the spell.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But, you know, um, you're kind of an 
                         orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a 
                         lot in common.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Shrek?

               OUTSIDE

               Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his 
               hand.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to himself) Princess, I - - Uh, how's 
                         it going, first of all? Good? Um, good 
                         for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower 
                         and thought of you because it's pretty 
                         and - - well, I don't really like it, 
                         but I thought you might like it 'cause 
                         you're pretty. But I like you anyway. 
                         I'd - - uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. 
                         Okay, here we go.
 
               He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey 
               and Fiona talking.
 
                                     FIONA
                         (os) I can't just marry whoever I want. 
                         Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, 
                         really, who can ever love a beast so 
                         hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" 
                         don't go together. That's why I can't 
                         stay here with Shrek.
 
               Shrek steps back in shock.

                                     FIONA
                         (os) My only chance to live happily 
                         ever after is to marry my true love.
 
                         
               Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks 
               away.
 
               INSIDE

                                     FIONA
                         Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how 
                         it has to be. It's the only way to break 
                         the spell.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         No! You can't breathe a word. No one 
                         must ever know.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What's the point of being able to talk 
                         if you gotta keep secrets?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Promise you won't tell. Promise!

                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. I won't tell him. 
                         But you should. (goes outside) I just 
                         know before this is over, I'm gonna 
                         need a whole lot of serious therapy. 
                         Look at my eye twitchin'.
 
               Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks 
               down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back 
               inside the windmill.
 
               MORNING

               Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still 
               awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.
 
                                     FIONA
                         I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, 
                         I tell him not. I tell him. (she quickly 
                         runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! 
                         Shrek, there's something I want...(she 
                         looks and sees the rising sun, and as 
                         the sun crests the sky she turns back 
                         into a human.)
 
               Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards 
               her.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Shrek. Are you all right?

                                     SHREK
                         Perfect! Never been better.

                                     FIONA
                         I - - I don't - - There's something 
                         I have to tell you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         You don't have to tell me anything, 
                         Princess. I heard enough last night.
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         You heard what I said?

                                     SHREK
                         Every word.

                                     FIONA
                         I thought you'd understand.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who 
                         could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
 
                         
                                     FIONA
                         But I thought that wouldn't matter to 
                         you.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at 
                         him in shock. He looks past her and 
                         spots a group approaching.) Ah, right 
                         on time. Princess, I've brought you 
                         a little something.
 
               Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal 
               sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only 
               like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers 
               march by.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots 
                         the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? 
                         Couldn't have been the donkey.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona.

                                     SHREK
                         As promised. Now hand it over.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece 
                         of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared 
                         out, as agreed. Take it and go before 
                         I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) 
                         Forgive me, Princess, for startling 
                         you, but you startled me, for I have 
                         never seen such a radiant beauty before. 
                         I'm Lord Farquaad.
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad 
                         snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, 
                         for I was just saying a short... (Watches 
                         as Farquaad is lifted off his horse 
                         and set down in front of her. He comes 
                         to her waist.) farewell.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have 
                         to waste good manners on the ogre. It's 
                         not like it has feelings.
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, you're right. It doesn't.

               Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless 
                         Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. 
                         Will you be the perfect bride for the 
                         perfect groom?
 
                                     FIONA
                         Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would 
                         make - -
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start 
                         the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get 
                         married today before the sun sets.
 
                         
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. 
                         The sooner, the better. There's so much 
                         to do! There's the caterer, the cake, 
                         the band, the guest list. Captain, round 
                         up some guests! (a guard puts Fiona 
                         on the back of his horse)
 
                                     FIONA
                         Fare-thee-well, ogre.

               Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches 
               them go.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting 
                         her get away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yeah? So what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, there's something about her you 
                         don't know. Look, I talked to her last 
                         night, She's - -
 
                                     SHREK
                         I know you talked to her last night. 
                         You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if 
                         you two are such good friends, why don't 
                         you follow her home?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

                                     SHREK
                         I told you, didn't I? You're not coming 
                         home with me. I live alone! My swamp! 
                         Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! 
                         Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, 
                         talking donkeys!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         But I thought - -

                                     SHREK
                         Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! 
                         (stomps off)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek.

               Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona 
               being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running 
               into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner 
               alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.
 
               SHREK'S HOME

               Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes 
               outside to investigate.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues 
                         with what he's doing.) What are you 
                         doing?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         I would think, of all people, you would 
                         recognize a wall when you see one.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed 
                         to go around my swamp, not through it.
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         It is around your half. See that's your 
                         half, and this is my half.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh! Your half. Hmm.

                                     DONKEY
                         Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. 
                         I did half the work. I get half the 
                         booty. Now hand me that big old rock, 
                         the one that looks like your head.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Back off!

                                     DONKEY
                         No, you back off.

                                     SHREK
                         This is my swamp!

                                     DONKEY
                         Our swamp.

                         (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working 
                         with) Let go, Donkey!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         You let go.

                                     SHREK
                         Stubborn jackass!

                         Smelly ogre.

                                     SHREK
                         Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks 
                         away)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through 
                         with you yet.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I'm through with you.

                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, 
                         "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now 
                         it's my turn! So you just shut up and 
                         pay attention! You are mean to me. You 
                         insult me and you don't appreciate anything 
                         that I do! You're always pushing me 
                         around or pushing me away.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so 
                         bad, how come you came back?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Because that's what friends do! They 
                         forgive each other!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive 
                         you... for stabbin' me in the back! 
                         (goes into the outhouse and slams the 
                         door)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, 
                         onion boy, you're afraid of your own 
                         feelings.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Go away!

                                     DONKEY
                         There you are , doing it again just 
                         like you did to Fiona. All she ever 
                         do was like you, maybe even love you.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a 
                         hideous creature. I heard the two of 
                         you talking.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         She wasn't talkin' about you. She was 
                         talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't 
                         talking about me? Well, then who was 
                         she talking about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. 
                         You don't wanna listen to me. Right? 
                         Right?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey!

                                     DONKEY
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) 
                         I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, 
                         stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Right. Friends?

                                     DONKEY
                         Friends.

                                     SHREK
                         So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         What are you asking me for? Why don't 
                         you just go ask her?
 
                                     SHREK
                         The wedding! We'll never make it in 
                         time.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's 
                         a will, there's a way and I have a way. 
                         (whistles)
 
               Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so 
               they can climb on.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Donkey?

                                     DONKEY
                         I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
 
                         
               They both laugh.

                                     SHREK
                         Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a 
                         noogie)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, all right. Don't get all 
                         slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All 
                         right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't 
                         had a chance to install the seat belts 
                         yet.
 
               They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc.

               DULOC - CHURCH

               Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.
 
               
                                     PRIEST
                         People of DuLoc, we gather here today

                         ...of our new king...

                                     FIONA
                         Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead 
                         to the "I do's"?
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (chuckles and then motions to the priest 
                         to indulge Fiona) Go on.
 
               COURTYARD

               Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with 
               a boom. The guards all take off running.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. 
                         If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 
                         that? (she nods and goes after the guards) 
                         Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You 
                         wanna do this right, don't you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         (at the Church door) What are you talking 
                         about?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         There's a line you gotta wait for. The 
                         preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or 
                         forever hold your peace." That's when 
                         you say, "I object!"
 
                                     SHREK
                         I don't have time for this!

                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen 
                         to me! Look, you love this woman, don't 
                         you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         You wanna hold her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please her?

                                     SHREK
                         Yes!

                                     DONKEY
                         (singing James Brown style) Then you 
                         got to, got to try a little tenderness. 
                         (normal) The chicks love that romantic 
                         crap!
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right! Cut it out. When does this 
                         guy say the line?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         We gotta check it out.

               INSIDE CHURCH

               As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the 
               windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.
 
                                     PRIEST
                         And so, by the power vested in me...
 
                         
               Outside

                                     SHREK
                         What do you see?

                         They're at the altar.

                         Oh, for the love of Pete!

               He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.
 
               
               INSIDE CHURCH

                         Shrek?

               The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, now what does he want?

                                     SHREK
                         (to congregation as he reaches the front 
                         of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' 
                         a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first

                                     SHREK
                         Really, it's rude enough being alive 
                         when no one wants you, but showing up 
                         uninvited to a wedding...

                         Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little 
                         late for that, so if you'll excuse me

                         But you can't marry him.

                                     FIONA
                         And why not?

                                     SHREK
                         Because- - Because he's just marring 
                         you so he can be king.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         He's not your true love.

                                     FIONA
                         And what do you know about true love?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - -

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen 
                         in love with the princess! Oh, good 
                         Lord. (laughs)
 
               The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The 
               whole congregation laughs.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         An ogre and a princess!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek, is this true?

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, 
                         my love, we're but a kiss away from 
                         our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! 
                         (puckers his lips and leans toward her, 
                         but she pulls back.)
 
                                     FIONA
                         (looking at the setting sun) "By night 
                         one way, by day another." (to Shrek) 
                         I wanted to show you before.
 
               She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. 
               She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona 
                         smiles)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! 
                         I order you to get that out of my sight 
                         now! Get them! Get them both!
 
               The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights 
               them.
 
                                     SHREK
                         No, no!

                                     FIONA
                         Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This 
                         marriage is binding, and that makes 
                         me king! See? See?
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, let go of me! Shrek!

                                     SHREK
                         No!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Don't just stand there, you morons.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll make you regret the day we met. 
                         I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll 
                         beg for death to save you!
 
                                     FIONA
                         No, Shrek!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And 
                         as for you, my wife...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Fiona!

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'll have you locked back in that tower 
                         for the rest of your days! I'm king!
 
                         
               Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I will have order! I will have perfection! 
                         I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon 
                         show up and the dragon leans down and 
                         eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon 
                         here, and I'm not afraid to use it. 
                         (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on 
                         the edge!
 
               The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth 
               and falls to the ground.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Celebrity marriages. They never last, 
                         do they?
 
               The congregation cheers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Go ahead, Shrek.

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Fiona?

                                     FIONA
                         Yes, Shrek?

                                     SHREK
                         I - - I love you.

                                     FIONA
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         Really, really.

                                     FIONA
                         (smiles) I love you too.

               Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 
               'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.
 
               
                                     CONGREGATION
                         Aawww!

               Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted 
               up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around 
               her.
 
                                     WHISPERS
                         "Until you find true love's first kiss 
                         and then take love's true form. Take 
                         love's true form. Take love's true form."
 
                         
               Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell 
               and then is slowly lowered to the ground.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are 
                         you all right?
 
                                     FIONA
                         (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, 
                         yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed 
                         to be beautiful.
 
                                     SHREK
                         But you ARE beautiful.

               They smile at each other.

                                     DONKEY
                         (chuckles) I was hoping this would be 
                         a happy ending.
 
               Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...

               THE SWAMP

               ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
               a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
               and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
               carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
               which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
               up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
               instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
               has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
               walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
               singing the song.
 
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         God bless us, every one.

                                     DONKEY
                         (as he's done singing and we fade to 
                         black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't 
                         breathe. I can't breathe.
 
               THE END

          INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT
                         
          A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
          descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
          Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
          plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Onward Chauncey, to the highest
           room of the tallest tower! Where
           my princess awaits rescue from her
           handsome Prince Charming.
                         
          Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
          wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
          bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another
          stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
          In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
          effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back
          stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
          lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
          of a cheaply painted backdrop.
                         
          The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the
          audience.

           Me too.
                         
          Pinocchio's nose grows as he is caught in the lie.
                         
          Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Whoa there, Chauncey!
                         
          He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He
          strikes a dramatic pose.
                         
          A Princess leans from a tower window.
                         
                          ACTRESS
           Hark! The brave Prince Charming
           approach-ith.
                         
          Prince Charming puffs his chest out.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay
           the monster that guards you and
           take my place as rightful King.
                         
          An old couple at a table look confused.
                         
                          OLD LADY
           (to old man)
           What did she say?
                         
          Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
          him.
                         
          A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage.
                         
                          OGRE
           Grrrrrrr!
                         
          The crowd erupts into applause. The Fairytale Creatures
          cheer.

           Yea! Shrek!
                         
          At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
          Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the
          monster.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Prepare foul beast to enter into a
           world of pain with which you are
           not familiar!
                         
          He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake.
                         
                          WAITER

           Do you mind?
                         
          Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on
          stage. It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade.

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then
          tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again.
          The tower facade starts to topple.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (CLEARS THROAT)
           Prepare foul beast-
                         
          Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
          falling. He cringes.
                         
          The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is
          unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The
          crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes
          his mangled sword at the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           (shaking his sword again)
           Someday you'll be sorry.

           We already are!
                         
          They laugh again. Prince Charming throws down his sword,
          picks up his hobby horse and exits.
                         
                          OGRE
           Grrrrrrr!
                         
          The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage.
                         
                         
          INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads
          to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it.
          He opens it.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make-
          shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.
                         
          Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far
          Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince
          Charming breaks down and cries.
                         
          He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
          to the vanity. "Don't stop believing! Mommy's Little Angel"
          is written on the picture.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (HEAVY SOBS)
           Oh mommy.
                         
          He weeps again and then looks back at the picture. A
          determined change grows across his face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh, you're right. I can't let this
           happen. I can't.
                         
          Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill. His
          expression hardens. He stands and faces the castle. He
          holds his chin up high.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I am the rightful King of Far Far
           Away and I promise you this mother.
           I will restore dignity to my
           throne!
                         
          A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face.
          He peels it off and looks at the headline. His eyes tense
          and narrow.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           And this time, no one will stand in
           my way!
                         
          In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
          crowd.
                         
          Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists.
                         
                         
          EXT. CASTLE - MORNING
                         
          The camera booms down from the Far Far Away sign. The sun
          rises and the birds sing.
                         
                         
          INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The sun shines through the bedroom window as the camera pans
          over to Shrek and Fiona waking up.
                         
                          SHREK
           Good morning.

          Shrek breathes in and smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (DREAMY)
           I know. Isn't it wonderful?
                         
          The bedroom doors fly open and Donkey and the Dronkeys rush
          in. The Dronkeys head right for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek
          cowers beneath the bedclothes.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (SINGING)
           "Good morning! Good morning!"
                         
          Shrek sinks further into the blankets as the Dronkeys
          exuberantly lick him. Fiona is amused.
                         
          Donkey starts to sing "Good Morning" from Singin' in the Rain
          as he enters the room.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (SINGING)

           morning! Good morning.
           (coming closer and closer
                          TO SHREK)
           "To you!"
                          (TO SHREK)
           "And you!"
                          (TO DRONKEY)
           And you!
                         
          The Dronkeys fly out of the room, knocking down everything in
          their path.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh, they grow up so fast.
                         
          Shrek, greatly annoyed, lifts his hand and snuffs out a
          little fire on the bed left behind by the Dronkeys.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not fast enough.
                         
          Puss leaps onto the bed.
                         
                          PUSS
           Okay. You have a very full day
           filling in for the King and Queen.
           There are several functions that
           require your attendance, sir.

           Great! Let's get started.
                         
          Shrek immediately pulls the covers up over his head and
          starts to snore.
                         
                          DONKEY
           C'mon, lazy bones, time to get
           movin'!
                         
          Donkey yanks the sheets off of Fiona and Shrek. He is
          surprised to see Shrek's bare legs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aaahhh! You know you really need
           to get yourself a pair of jammies.
                         
          Shrek sighs.

          INT. KNIGHTING CEREMONY - DAY
                         
          The camera pans down from a stained glass window. The song
          "Royal Pain" by the Eels plays in the background as the
          title: "Shrek The Third" is superimposed.
                         
          A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek
          walks down the aisle of the church.
                         
          Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.
                         
          Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea
          what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who
          indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek
          starts to knight the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           I knight thee...
                         
          Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           He-he. Ooh.
                         
          The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked.

          Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal
          Navy.
                         
          Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the
          boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws
          the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the
          side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.
                         
          Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their
          heads as they leave.

          Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around
          Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of
          them.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Well, since you're filling in for
           one, you might as well look like a
           real King. Can somebody come in
           here and work on Shrek please?
                         
          Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow.

          He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.
                         
          A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip
          cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He
          turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind
          away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.
                         
          We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into
          frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.
                         
          Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.

          Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to
          reveal that the lips are Shrek's.
                         
          A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps
          snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and
          tighten up the zipper all the way.
                         
          A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn,
          Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!
                         
          A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is
          tightened.
                         
          A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's
          belt. A mole is placed on his cheek.

           keep this up Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please
           just try to grin and bear it? It's
           just until Dad gets better.
                         
          Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek?
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah.
                         
                          FIONA
           You look handsome.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah. Come here, you.
                         
          She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles
          back.
                         
          Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but
          their bulky outfits prevent it.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, my butt is itching up a storm
           and I can't reach it in this monkey
           suit!
                         
          Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh.
                          (WHISTLE)
           Hey you. Come here!
                         
          A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           What's your name?

           Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir.
                         
                          SHREK

          INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The announcer introduces Shrek and Fiona.
                         
           MASTER OF CEREMONIES
           Ladies and gentlemen, Princess
           Fiona and Sir Shrek!
                         
          The audience claps. The curtain starts to open.
          Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt.
                         
                          SHREK
           You've done it. Oh, a little over
           to the left, yeah. That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh Shrek?
                         
          Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd
          looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh
           yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!
           Oh that's good!
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek...
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You
           got it. You're on it. That's
           great!
                         
                          FIONA
           SHREK!
                         
          Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both
          freeze. Shrek laughs nervously.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the
          eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ow!! My eye! My eye!
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 11.
                         
                         
                         
          As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.
                         
                          WOMAN
           What are you doing?
                         
          The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a
          guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the
          axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The
          axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona
          maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the
          vase which causes Fiona to fall over.
                         
          Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding
          Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his
          pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the
          stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying
          through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,
          trapping him.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Uhhh...
                          (WIMPER)
                         
          Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor.
                         
                          SHREK
           Are you okay?
                         
                          FIONA
           Yeah. I'm fine.
                         
          Fiona's eyes suddenly widen.
                         
          Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter
          carrying flaming skewers.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Ahhhh!
                         
          The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame
          with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and
          land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of
          the skewers out and takes a bite.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh! Shrimp! My favorite.

          The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden
          ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half.
                         
          The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables
          slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide.
                         
          CRASH! BANG!
                         
           CUT TO BLACK:
                         
                         
          INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The door to Fiona's room flies open.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's it! We're leaving!
                         
          Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.
                         
                          FIONA
           Honey, please calm down...
                         
          Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.
                         
                          SHREK
           Calm down? Who do you think we're
           kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut
           out for this, Fiona and I never
           will be.
                         
          Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings
          his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to
          Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I think that went pretty well.
                         
          Shrek startles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey!
                         
          Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aww, come on now Shrek!
                         
          Shrek slams the door shut.
                         
          Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on
          his pillow.

                          PUSS
           Some people just don't understand
           boundaries.
                         
          Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him
          outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the
          ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the
          blinds.
                         
          Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries
          to calm him down.
                         
                          FIONA
           Just think... a couple more days,
           and we'll be back home in our
           vermin-filled shack, strewn with
           fungus, filled with the rotting
           stench of mud and neglect.
                         
          This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath
          and exhales. He smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
                         
                          FIONA
           And, uh... maybe even the pitter-
           patter of little feet on the
           floor...?
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)
           That's right. The swamp rats will
           be spawning.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh, no... you know, what I was
           thinking of is a little bit bigger
           than a swamp rat.
                         
                          SHREK

                          FIONA
           No, Shrek. Um... what if -
                          THEORETICALLY -
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah?
                         
                          FIONA
           They were little ogre feet?

          Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed.
                         
          He slowly emerges from behind the bed.
                         
                          SHREK
           Honey? Let's try and be rational
           about this. Have you seen a baby
           lately? They just eat and poop and
           they cry and then they cry when
           they poop and they poop when they
           cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.
           They extra cry and they extra poop.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek.
                         
          She grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes.
                         
                          FIONA
           Don't you ever think about having a
           family?
                         
          Shrek takes her hand.
                         
                          SHREK
           Right now, you're my family.
                         
          There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open,
          revealing a Royal Page.
                         
          Shrek springs up.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well, somebody better be dying.

          The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's
          bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           I'm dying.
                         
          The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.
          Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen
          comes to the King's aid and he settles down.

          The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.

           Fiona...
                         
                          FIONA
           Yes Daddy?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           I know I've made many mistakes with
           you.
                         
                          FIONA
           It's okay.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           But your love for Shrek has taught
           me so much.
                         
          Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           My dear boy, I am proud to call you
           my son.
                         
                          SHREK

           Frog... King Dad in-law.
                         
          Shrek smiles.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Now, there is a matter of business
           to attend tooo...
                         
          The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops.
          They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat.
                         
                          PUSS
           The Frog King is dead.

          Fiona starts crying. The King suddenly wakes up, coughing.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (TO PUSS)
           Put your hat back on, fool.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Shrek, please come hither.
                         
          Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah, Dad?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           This Kingdom needs a new king. You
           and Fiona are next in line for the
           throne.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ooo. Next in line. Now you see
           Dad, that's why people love you.
           Even on your deathbed you're still
           making jokes.
                         
          The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in
          closer.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?
           I don't think that's such a good
           idea. There's got to be somebody
           else. Anybody?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Aside from you there is only one
           remaining heir.
                         
          Shrek brightens.
                         
                          SHREK

          Shrek leans in closer after each "is," waiting in
          anticipation. The King starts to hyperventilate.
                         
                          FIONA
           Daddy!
                         
          The King is dead. A fly comes out of his mouth and flies
          away.
                         
          Puss starts to take his hat off. The fly buzzes into frame.
          A tongue catches it. Puss puts his hat back on.
                         
                          KING HAROLD

           His name is Arthur.

          He succumbs. The King really is dead now.

          Donkey bows his head.

           Do your thing, man.
                         
          Puss takes his hat off.
                         
          Fiona starts to cry and hugs Shrek. The weight of the King's
          request hits Shrek. He is in a state of shock.
                         
          We hold a moment on the Queen, Shrek, Fiona, Puss and Donkey
          to let the King's passing sink in.

          The streets of Far Far Away are empty. People are closing up
          the shops on Rodeo Drive.

          EXT. POND - LATER
                         
          Close on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen,
          and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered
          for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box ("Ye Olde
          Footlocker") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out
          into the water.
                         
          An overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily
          pads. The camera tilts up to reveal a frog choir, singing
          "Live and Let Die." The Princesses, Donkey, Puss and the
          Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly.
                         
          Shrek puts his arm around Fiona.
                         
          The funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse.
          Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen
          sadly gazes at the pond.

          The camera pulls back to reveal a cloaked figure, on
          horseback, overlooking the funeral. The figure removes his
          hood to reveal Prince Charming. He gives a smug smile, and
          rides off.

          INT. POISONED APPLE BAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Smoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the
          top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns
          and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans
          over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a
          microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing
          "I've Never Been To Me" by Nancy Wilson.
                         
          The bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two
          pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master
          takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch
          of empty beer mugs.
                         
          Prince Charming enters the bar.
                         
          A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval
          mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and
          the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming.
                         
          Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera
          adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the
          Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes
          notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding
          Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves
          glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks
          by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)
          playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and
          the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck.
          Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the
          bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool,
          and sits.
                         
          Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He
          clears his throat.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           What does a Prince have to do to
           get a drink around here?
                         
          Mabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster
          with a smiling beer wench.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly
           stepsister I'll never know.
                         
          He winks at her. She glares at him.

           are you.
                         
          She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel.
                         
                          MABEL (CONT'D)

          Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The
          singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool
          cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           We're not your friends.
                         
          Prince Charming grows nervous.
                         
          The Villains all approach Prince Charming.
                         
          From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his
          shoulders and pins him on top of the bar.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahh!
                         
          Captain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming's neck.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK

          Captain Hook backs off, feeling insecure about his appendage.

           Mabel, remember how you couldn't

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Once upon a time, someone decided
           that we were the losers. But there
           are two sides to every story. And
           our side has not been told.
                         
          The crowd listens, rapt.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           So who will join me? Who wants to
           come out on top for once? Who
           wants their happily ever after?!
                         
          The crowd of villains cheer and starts getting rowdy. A bar
          room brawl ensues. Prince Charming looks on, shocked. He
          ducks out of the way of a flying liquor bottle. He smiles
          nervously and lifts his fruity, Fuzzy Navel to drink.

          The blind mice stumble and fall trying to get down the steps
          to the dock. The Fairy-tale Creatures and Dragon have
          gathered to wish Shrek, Puss and Donkey a bon voyage as they
          set off to retrieve Arthur.

          On the docks, two Dronkeys chase a seagull as the camera pans
          over to Puss who breaks free of the embrace of a lady cat.
                         
                          PUSS
           It's out of my hands senorita, the
           winds of fate have blown on my
           destiny. But I will never forget
           you. You are the love of my life.
                         
          Off-screen, a cat meows and walks towards Puss.

           And you.
                         
          Puss starts walking away as two of the cats begin to engage
          in a cat fight. They are hissing at each other as Puss backs
          away from them and into another.

           but I'd like to. I gotta go.
                         
          Puss runs out of frame. Cut to Dragon, who is talking to
          Donkey. Puss runs past them in the background. Dragon lets
          out a soft wail.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I know, I know... I don't want to
           leave you either baby, but you know
           how Shrek is. The dude's lost
           without me.
                         
          She gives him an understanding smile.

          He blows her a kiss and she catches it. He looks down at his

           Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could

          as the boat travels through an estuary and beaches itself.
                         
          Shrek wakes up. He opens the cabin door.

           Ahhh. Home.
                         
          He smiles to himself. The boat has beached itself right
          outside of Shrek's swamp house.
                         
          He leaps off the boat.

           Fiona!
                         
          After a moment of silence, he opens his eyes, realizing that
          Fiona is not there.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona?
                         
          He looks around the room, puzzled. The door slams closed
          behind him.

          A baby carriage rolls slowly into frame behind him. He turns
          slowly and sees the baby carriage covered with a blanket.
          Shrek removes the blanket, revealing a baby ogre, smiling
          innocently at him.
                         
                          SHREK
           Huh? Oh no.
                         
          The baby burps.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (AMUSED)
           Better out than in, I always say.
           Ha ha!
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Hiccup!
                         
          This time the baby's burp turns into projectile vomit aimed
          directly at Shrek. Shrek puts his hand up to block the
          vomit, but to no avail. The baby continues to vomit, but
          eventually stops after completely soiling himself and Shrek.
          The baby looks like it's about to cry. Shrek raises his
          hands.
                         
                          SHREK
           No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha.
           It's okay. It's gonna be alright.
                         
          Shrek picks the baby up, smiling at it cautiously. He holds
          it awkwardly for a few seconds, then looks up and realizes
          that his house is filled with babies.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Da-Da!
                         
          Babies roll around his living room, tearing the fabric off
          his chair. The chair reclines, catapulting one of the babies
          onto Shrek's head. A standing lamp with a baby on top falls,
          and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the
          tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.
          Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One
          of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs
          over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a
          baby out of the cauldron.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya?
           No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.
                         
          Shrek panics. A baby is knocking glass jars off the shelf.
          Shrek catches him before he crawls off of it. Shrek runs
          through the room picking up babies.

                          SHREK
           Huh?
                         
          He sees a baby sitting in his bed, smiling up at him. The
          baby shrugs.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Bubabatoo?
                         
          Suddenly, Shrek hears a loud rumble. He turns around.
          Babies start pouring out of the window and the fireplace.
          First there is one, then two, then thirty more follow.
          Hundreds of them start piling in.
                         
          Shrek makes a run for the doorway, but no matter how hard he
          runs, the doorway keeps getting farther and farther away! He
          keeps trying, hundreds of babies trailing behind.

          Finally, Shrek reaches the door and opens it. He slams it
          shut behind him and closes his eyes. Everything is quiet.
          He opens his eyes and finds himself on stage in front of his
          high school.
                         
          Shrek looks up to find a graduation cap on his head. The
          audience is full of ogre babies laughing at him. The camera
          pulls back to reveal Shrek standing at the podium, naked.

          Donkey and Puss turn around, but they both have baby-ogre
          faces! Donkey makes a baby noise. As the camera zooms in,
          Donkey's eyes glow red and his teeth become sharp and pointy.

          Donkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to

           woman, a powerful urge sweeps over
           him...

           weeks of nothing but fishing.
                         
          Puss makes a "let's go fishing" gesture by casting an
          imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to
          whisper in Shrek's other ear.

                          DONKEY
           I'm already starting to feel
           nauseous from memories of wedgies
           and swirlies!
                         
                          PUSS
           But how did you receive the wedgies
           when you are clearly not the wearer
           of the underpants?
                         
                          DONKEY

           So then I was all like "I'd rather
           get the black plague and lock
           myself in an iron maiden than go
           out with you."

          The students panics when his nose starts to bleed.
                         
                          SHREK
           I know you're busy "not fitting in"
           but can either of you tell me where
           I can find Arthur?
                         
          While Xavier tries to control the bleeding, Gary points
          towards the athletic field.

          In the distance, Shrek spots A BOLD KNIGHT atop his steed.
          He looks very impressive as he rears up ready to charge.
                         
          Shrek, Donkey and Puss arrive to see the beginning of the
          charge. It's an exciting back and forth.
                         
          Hooves pound on sand.
                         
          The Knight's eyes steady.
                         
          The horse rears majestically.
                         
          The opponent's eyes widen in fear.
                         
          The lance hits, and the opponent flies through the air and
          lands in front of Shrek, Puss and Donkey.
                         
          Shrek looks back at the victorious Knight. He removes his
          helmet revealing a strong handsome face. The Knight enjoys
          his victory.
                         
                          KNIGHT (LANCELOT)

           what?
                         
          Shrek steps forward.

           Ow.
                         
          Shrek looks down, his foot planted square in the chest of
          LANCELOT's opponent. Shrek steps back.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh. Sorry.
                         
          The kid doesn't budge, his arms and legs still sprawled out
          where he hit the ground.

          The Knight's horse rears up and he falls off. The horse
          gallops off. The Knight looks up at Shrek in fear.

           So what for like are you supposed

           leprechaun... You made a funny.
                         
          Shrek scoops up the Knight, tosses him over his shoulder,
          ogre-style.

           I'm not Arthur!
                         
          Shrek stops and holds Lancelot above his head. Lancelot
          tries to regain his dignity.
                         
                          LANCELOT

          Artie turns his head briefly, but keeps on walking.
                         
          Shrek sighs and dumps Lancelot to the ground.

          Off-screen we hear mumbling from inside a locker. Shrek and
          Puss look as Donkey pushes the locker door open. He has been

          and pulling Shrek's skin. Shrek tries to hide the pain.

          Principal Pynchley presides over an assembly for the entire
          student body. He speaks through a megaphone.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           Thank you to Professor Primbottom
           for his invigorating lecture on how
           to just say "nay".
                         
          Two students are standing next to Pynchley. One is dressed
          up like a dragon and the other as a griffin.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           And now, without further ado, let's
           give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah
           to the winner of our "New Mascot"
           contest... the--
                         
          Shrek bursts through the double-doors of the gym.
                         
           PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY (CONT'D)
           --ogre?
                         
          The students gasp as Shrek marches forward.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's right. I'm the new mascot.
           So let's really try and beat the
           other guys... at whatever it is
           they're doing.
                         
          The band plays Smashmouth's "Rock Star."
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           This is indeed all a bit
           unorthodox.
                         
          Without breaking stride, Shrek grabs Principal Pynchley's
          megaphone.
                         
                          SHREK
           Now, where can I find Arthur
           Pendragon?

          The students all point... to the basketball hoop, where Artie
          hangs helplessly. Shrek, Donkey and Puss turn and look up
          and see the freshly wedgied student. The students laugh.
                         
          In the front row, Lancelot bumps fists with Bohort.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           Classic.
                         
          Donkey turns to Lancelot.
                         
                          DONKEY
           You should be ashamed of yourself.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           I didn't do it. They did.
                         
          Lance points to the D&D nerds. They are beside themselves
          with nasal laughter. Nosebleed boy starts bleeding again.
                         
          Shrek reaches up and pulls Artie down to eye level.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Please don't eat me.
                         
                          STUDENTS
                          (CHANTING)
           Eat him! Eat him!
                         
          Even Principal Pynchley gets caught up in the excitement.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           Eat him!
          Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm not here to eat him.

          The students react with surprise and disbelief.

           Nice one Lance!
                         
          They high five. The tuba player plays a Wha-wha-wha.
                         
                          LANCELOT

                          SHREK
           Absolutely. Now clean out your
           locker, kid. You've got a kingdom
           to run.

           So wait, I'm really the only heir?
                         
          Shrek pauses for just a moment, then...
                         
                          SHREK
           The one and only.

           Give me just a second.
                         
          Artie turns back to the crowd and delivers a heartfelt
          speech.
                         
                          ARTIE
           My good people, I think there's a
           lesson here for all of us. Maybe
           the next time you're about to dunk
           a kid's head in a chamber pot,
           you'll stop and think, hey, maybe
           this guy has feelings. Maybe I
           should cut him some slack. Because
           maybe, just maybe... this guy's
           gonna turn out to be, uh...I
           dunno...a King! And maybe his
           first royal decree will be to
           banish everyone who ever picked on
           him -- that's right, I'm looking at
           you, jousting team.
                         
          Artie points and Lancelot and his buddies look horrified.

          All the Princesses and Fairy-tale Creatures have gathered for
          Fiona's baby shower. A group of birds gently place a
          flowered wreath on Fiona's head. The Princesses all gaze at
          her.

           you've been pregnant?
                         
          Fiona stands at the buffet table, stuffing her face with
          cakes, pies, and anything else she can get her hands on.
                         
                          FIONA

          She takes another bite.

           Oooh! It's present time!
                         
          The birds and forest creatures all flock to Snow White. They
          chirp and hoot happily. Snow White looks annoyed.

           Oh, Fiona, won't you please open
           mine first? It's the one in front.
                         
          Fiona reads the card.

          Prince Charming becomes frustrated, he turns Pinocchio's head

          Prince Charming gets in Pinocchio's face.

           You're telling me you don't know

          Pinocchio is still a little nervous.
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume
           that I couldn't exactly not say
           that is or isn't almost partially
           incorrect.
                         
          Pinocchio thinks he has the upper hand.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

                          PINOCCHIO
           On the contrary, I'm possibly more
           or less, not definitely rejecting
           the idea, that in no way, with any
           amount of uncertainty that...

           If that indeed wasn't where he
           isn't. Even if he wasn't not where
           I knew he was could mean that I
           wouldn't completely not know where
           he wasn't.
                         
          Gingerbread Man continues to sing his "Lollipop Song."

          The pig realizes his admission and immediately covers his
          mouth. Pinocchio laughs nervously.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           He's bringing back the next heir?

          A shuffle board stick slides next to Artie. He grabs it.

           Back to what? Being a loser?!
                         
          As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone
          too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to
          yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the
          decking.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)

                          ARTIE
           Look what I did? Who's holding the
           wheel chief?
                         
          Donkey climbs up onto the railing. He is seasick and is
          about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead.

           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer
          the ship clear of the rocks.

          The camera pans past the boat. Off-screen we hear the boat
          crash into the rocks.

          EXT. BEACH - DUSK
                         
          Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach.
          He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek
          drops Puss and Donkey.
                         
          Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur
          puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame.
                         
                          PUSS
           How humiliating...
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

           Oh, so now it's "Your highness?"
           What happened to "loser?" Huh?
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey, if you think this is getting
           you out of anything, well it isn't.
           We're heading back to Far Far Away
           one way or another, and you're
           gonna be a father!
                         
          Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek
          uncomfortably.
                         
                          ARTIE

          Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a
          path into the woods.
                         
                          SHREK
           Where do you think you're going?

           mean it!
                         
          Artie keeps climbing.
                         
                          PUSS
           Uh boss, I don't think he's coming
           back and maybe it's for the best.
           He is not exactly king material.
                         
          Shrek looks towards Artie.
                         
                          DONKEY

                          SHREK
           Oh c'mon, now why would I do that?
           Besides, he'll be ten times better
           at it than me.
                         
          Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then
           you're gonna have to change your
           tactics if you want to get anywhere
           with this kid.

           You're right, Donkey.
                         
          Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood.
                         
                          SHREK
           What about this?
                         
          Donkey shakes his head in disgust.

          Shrek tosses the log.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.
                          (LAUGHS)
           Still...
                         
          Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie.

          Artie marches up the mountain trail.
                         
          Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic
          with the kid. He catches up to Artie.
                         
                          SHREK
           Listen Artie...
                         
          Artie looks back over his shoulder. He sees Shrek and just
          keeps going.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           If you think this whole mad scene
           ain't dope, I feel you dude. I
           mean, I'm not trying to get up in
           your grill or raise your roof or
           whatever, but what I am screaming
           is, yo, check out this kazing
           thazing bazaby.
                         
          Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices a
          cottage in the distance and heads toward it.
                         
                          SHREK

           trippin', just say, oh no you
           didn't, you know, you're gettin' on
           my last nerve. And then I'll know
           it's... then I'll know it's whack--
                         
          Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch,
          striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running.

          A boiling soup pot sits over a fire in front of a small
          shack. Artie charges though, pounding desperately on the
          door.

          Shrek, Puss, and Donkey run into the camp.

          Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that
          is hung on the door. A bright, colorful image of an old
          wizard's head is projected out. Donkey is terrified.
                         
                          DONKEY

          With a "FZZZZT" and a "BLOOP", the image disappears.
                         
          The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out.
                         
                          MERLIN

          is promptly zapped in the head.

           Yeah. He was the school's magic

           breakdown.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, technically I was merely a
           victim of a level three fatigue,
           and at the request of my therapist
           and the school authorities, I have
           retired to the tranquility of
           nature to discover my divine
           purpose.
                         
          Merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head.
                         
          Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment.

           Uh, no.
                         
          Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks.

           rock au-gratin?
                         
          Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly. His gums are bleeding
          from eating rocks.
                         
                          MERLIN

                          SHREK
           Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of
           people counting on you so don't try
           and weasel out of it.

           I know, and I'm gonna miss him.

           You know what? Why don't you go

                          SHREK
           Oh, is that some kind of crack
           about ogres? You get your royal
           highness to Far Far Away before I
           kick it there.
                          (TO MERLIN)
           Now which way am I kicking?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oh, I could tell you. But since
           you're in the midst of self-
           destructive rage spiral it would be
           karmic-ly irresponsible.

           Most definitely, but only after you
           take the journey to your soul.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah, I don't think so.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Look pal, it's either that or some
           primal scream therapy.
           Ahhhhhhhhhh!
                         
          Shrek grabs Merlin's mouth and closes it.
                         
                          SHREK
           Alright, alright... journey to the

          A fire blazes.
                         
          Merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now all of you, look into the "Fire
           of Truth" and tell me what you see!
           Yah! Ha!
           (Wild war cry)
           Woo-looo-looo-looo!
                         
          He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e.
          Rorschach inkblots).
                         
          Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a
           dutch fudge torte with cinnamon
           swirls.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Okay. Monster, go for it.
                         
          Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare
          begins to take shape in the smoke. He blows the image away.
          He covers his fear and changes the subject.
                         
                          SHREK

           Now! The boy!
                         
                          ARTIE
           This is lame.
                         
          Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Ow!
                         
                          MERLIN
           You're lame! Now just go for it.
                         
          He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay. There's a baby bird and a
           father bird sitting in a nest.
                         
          Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to
          change as he stays focused.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Wait, the dad just flew away. Why
           did he leave the little bird all
           alone?
                         
          Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more
          worked up.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's trying to fly, but it doesn't
           know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
                         
          Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts
          away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him,
          stunned.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Whew, proper head case you are,
           aren't you? Really messed up.
           Whoa.
                         
          Merlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie.

           Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The
           bird's me. My dad left. So what?
                         
                         
          Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie.
          Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists.

           Look Artie...um-
                         
          Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are
          For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device
          drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the
          shack where Merlin peeks out.
                         
                          MERLIN
           (loud, over the music)

          Everyone stares at him.
                         
          He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's
          quiet again.
                         
                          SHREK
           I know what it's like to not feel

          Artie looks at him.

           I know you want me to be king, but
           I can't. I'm not cut out for it and
           I never will be, alright?
                         
          Shrek takes this in.

           Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth
           the trouble. He dumped me at that
           school the first chance he got and
           I never heard from him again.

           My dad wasn't really the fatherly
           type either.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Well, I doubt he was worse than
           mine.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.
           He tried to eat me.
                         
          Artie looks at Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           Now, I guess I should have seen it
           coming. He used to give me a bath
           in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
           with an apple in my mouth.
                         
          Artie chuckles at this.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay... I guess that's... pretty
           bad.
                         
          Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.
                         
                          SHREK
           You know, it may be hard to believe
           what with my obvious charm and good
           looks, but people used to think
           that I was a monster. And for a
           long time, I believed them.
                         
          Artie looks up at Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           But after awhile, you learn to
           ignore the names that people call
           you and you just trust who you are.
                         
          Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know, you're okay, Shrek.
                         
          He tosses the stick into the fire.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You just need to do a little less
           yelling and use a little more soap.

                          ARTIE
           The soap's because you stink.
           Really bad.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah. I got that.
                         
          The camera slowly booms up and away from the group as the
          fire continues to burn.

          The Princesses, Fiona and the Queen are surrounded by
          darkness as they tiptoe down the steps and into the catacombs
          below the castle.
                         
          They round a corner and step onto a ledge with Fiona leading
          the way, holding a torch.

                          SNOW WHITE
           Well maybe it just bothers you that
           I was voted fairest in the land.

          Snow White and Rapunzel share an indignant look.
                         
          Fiona travels deeper into the catacombs. The other
          Princesses follow.

           So I guess the plan is we just

           No, we're gonna get inside and find

           That's it!
                         
          Fiona, the Queen and the Princesses run towards a long ladder

          They peer around a corner and see the construction of an
          outdoor theater is underway. Two stagehands walk by carrying
          a large dragon set piece. Evil dwarves are busy painting the
          set. The finishing touches are put on the stage tower.
                         
          The Princesses hug the wall as a group of guards march by.
                         
          Rapunzel takes off in the other direction, and signals the
          Princesses to follow her.

          Fiona and the Princesses race after Rapunzel. They spot her
          sprinting into the castle and follow her. They burst through
          the doors and see Prince Charming holding Rapunzel by the
          arm.

          A large group of armed Far Far Away Guards surround them.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles at Fiona.

           Woof!
                         
          He looks back at Rapunzel lovingly, and the two share a long
          kiss. Fiona and the other Princesses are shocked.
                         
                          FIONA

          Cinderella claps excitedly.

           Yaaaaaaaaay!
                         
          The Princesses stare her down.
                         
                          FIONA
           Rapunzel, how could you?
                         
                          RAPUNZEL
           Jealous much?
                         
          Prince Charming eyes up the Princesses.

           Soon you'll be back where you

           locked away in towers; that is, if
           I let you last the week.

           us, we have a show to put on.

           and you'll be sorry.
                         
          He stops and flashes a sadistic smile.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

          Shrek startles awake. He sits up and scratches his head,
          looking around. He realizes it's morning.
                         
          Behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch. Suddenly,
          the tree branch that was holding the bird flicks it off.
                         
          Shrek senses the movement behind him and turns around to find
          everything is normal. He turns back around to wake up
          everyone.
                         
          The trees start to advance toward Shrek.
                         
          The log Artie is sleeping on suddenly sits up, knocking
          Artie, who is still asleep, to the ground.

           Ow!
                         
          The tree turns around to reveal an Evil Tree. Donkey finally
          wakes up.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ahhh!
                         
          The Evil Trees continue to advance. A piano is heard. The
          trees part and Hook is revealed to be playing the piano.
                         
          The music builds to a dramatic finale. Captain Hook turns
          away from his keys and faces them.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Look out! They've got a piano!

           Kill `em all. Except the fat one.
                         
          He stares hard at Shrek and aims his hooked prosthetic.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           King Charming has something special
           in mind for you, ogre.
                         
          Shrek is perplexed.

           Attack!
                         
          Pirates charge forward, swinging in from the tree branches.
                         
                          PIRATES
           AAAARGH!
                         
          One lands and gets his peg-leg stuck in the ground.
                         
          The pirates close in. Shrek grabs one and throws him to the
          side.
                         
          One pirate raises his sword and prepares to swing at Artie.
                         
                          SHREK
           Artie, Duck!
                         
          Shrek pushes Artie's head down and the sword narrowly misses
          him. The pirate prepares to swing again and Shrek lifts
          Artie above his head.

          Still in the air, Artie uses both legs to kick the pirate to
          the ground. Shrek and Artie share a satisfied look.
                         
          A pirate charges Donkey.

           Ahhh!
                         
          Puss draws his sword and begins fighting off the pirate,
          protecting Donkey.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK

           Argh! Argh!
                         
          The camera pans across the back of the piano to reveal Merlin
          happily playing along with Captain Hook. He notices and
          rudely elbows Merlin out of the way.
                         
          A pirate runs at Shrek, only to be tripped by Artie. The
          pirate bounces off Shrek's belly.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ready the plank!
                         
          A wooden board is thrown on a stump, creating a makeshift
          "plank." The pirates back Shrek onto the plank.
                         
          Several pirates with swords force Shrek onto the plank. He
          is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a
          waiting treasure chest below. Several pirates try to shut the
          lid on him.
                         
          Puss, Donkey and Artie are trying to hold off the Villains.
          Suddenly, two Evil Trees come into frame and scoop Puss,
          Donkey and Artie up in a net.
                         
          The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie. Artie
          starts to panic. Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut
          through the netting.
                         
          The cannon fuse is lit.
                         
          Shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the
          chest still stuck to his behind.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Help!

          Shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan. He
          grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest.
          He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and
          catapults himself over to the cannon. At the last second,
          Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction.
          The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it
          into pieces.
                         
          Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that
          holds Donkey, Puss and Artie. The Evil Trees and Pirates
          take off running.
                         
          Captain Hook turns and sees his army running off. He shakes
          his hook in the air.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ya cowards!
                         
                          SHREK
           What has Charming done with Fiona?
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           She's gonna get what's coming to
           her.
                         
          He raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an
          Evil Tree's branch and is dragged away with the rest of the
          Villains.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK

          him now.
                         
          Artie, Puss, and Donkey run over to Shrek.
                         
                          PUSS
           We've got to save her!

           But she's so far far away!
                         
          Shrek thinks for a moment.

          approaches him.

           Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to
           get them...I mean, us, back to Far
           Far Away.
                         
          Merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his
          eye at Artie.
                         
                          MERLIN
                          (GETTING UP)
           Forget it. I don't have that kind
           of magic in me anymore, kid. How
           about a hug instead? Hmm? That's
           the best kind of magic.
                         
          Artie tries a new approach.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Mr. Merlin please. I know you can

          Merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his
          breath.
                         
                          MERLIN (CONT'D)
           Mumble, grumble, interrupt my
           healing. Mumble, mumble.
                         
          Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts
          to sob. Merlin stops and turns around.

           Oh. What, what's with you?
                         
          Artie continues to cry.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's just so hard. You know? They
           really need to get back `cause
           their kingdom's in trouble `cause
           there's a really bad man and it's
           just so hard...
                         
          Merlin is visibly uncomfortable.
                         
                          MERLIN
           C'mon, take it easy.
                         
          Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable.

           Oh, have a heart old man!
                         
          Artie grabs him, now desperate.
                         
                          ARTIE
           And they really need your help to
           get them back! So why won't you
           help them?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oh.
                         
          Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line.
                         
          Merlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my
           things.
                         
          Merlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers.
          Shrek is impressed.

           Well, well, well. You want some
           eggs with that ham?
                         
          Shrek smiles.
                         
          Merlin returns holding a spell book.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now, I am a little rusty, so there
           could be some side effects.
                         
                          DONKEY

                          MERLIN
           Don't worry, whatever it is, no
           matter how excruciatingly painful
           it may be, it'll wear off
           eventually... I think.
                         
          Merlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out
          his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Oops.
                         
          Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Are you sure this is a good idea?
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, if Artie trusts him, that's
           good enough for me. Even if his
           robe doesn't quite cover his-

           get back, um... soon!
                         
          Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers. Shrek, Puss,
          Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke.

          They reappear and fall out of the sky and bounce through the
          canopy of a large apple tree. They ping-pong through the
          foliage and land in a heap at the base of the tree.

          Donkey adjusts himself, feeling hung over.
                         
                          DONKEY (CONT'D)

           teeth?
                         
          Donkey's eyes widen. He realizes his voice is coming out of
          Puss' body.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Oh no!
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat. He looks down at
          Puss' boots. His tail begins to twitch.
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)

           fancy feasting second rate
           sidekick.
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in
          Puss' body).

           At least you don't look like some
           kind of bloated roadside piñata.

           on a diet!

           Yeah, and you should think about
           getting yourself a pair of pants!
           I feel all exposed and nasty.
                         
          Both Shrek and Artie stare at them. A strained smile pasted
          to their faces. They burst out laughing.
                         
          Donkey joins Puss, both of them scowling.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Oh, so you two think this is funny?
                         
          Puss is fuming.
                         
          Shrek and Artie regain their composure.

           Don't be! You got us back kid.
                         
          Shrek motions to Far Far Away, just a few miles ahead of
          them. He turns back to Artie.
                         
          Artie smiles.
                         
          Donkey takes a few awkward steps in Puss' body.

          Puss is shocked by this. He tries to recover.

          Shrek, Puss (in Donkey's body), and Artie rush past a welcome
          sign to the town that has been boarded over so it now reads
          "Go Go Away."
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) struggles to walk. His tender new
          feet hurt in their tiny boots.

           Woah!
                         
          Inside the kingdom, Rodeo Drive is trashed. There is graffiti
          everywhere.
                         
          Suddenly a carriage driven by Evil Witches comes zooming down
          Rodeo Drive.
                         
                          EVIL WITCHES

          The carriage zips around a corner on two wheels. A drunken
          Evil Dwarf is almost hit by the carriage while crossing the
          street.
                         
          Shrek is shocked by what he sees.
                         
          A crash is heard off-screen.

          A carriage wheel on fire rolls by a marionette theatre with

          costs per show.

          Shrek quickly dumps the change into the machine. The music
          starts and the curtain goes up again and Pinocchio dances.

          Pinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points
          to a poster on the wall. Puss reads the poster out loud.

                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)
           Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us
           you were in a play.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well I guess I've been so busy I
           forgot to mention it!

           GUARD #1 (O.S.)
           It's the ogre! Get him!
                         
          Shrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal
          knights, armed and ready. They drive them back into the
          alley. Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.
                         
          He whips his head towards the oncoming guards. His eyes are
          large and sweet. His lips pout. The guards are momentarily
          hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're
          staring at a donkey.
                         
          The guards recoil.
                         
                          GUARD #2
           Ugh! Kill it!
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats.
                         
          Artie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps
          forward, confronting the guards.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Look, don't you know who he thinks
           he is? How dare you?
                         
          Shrek picks up on his plan.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey, we're dealing with
           amateurs.
                         
          The guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the
          wall. Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the
          poster off the wall.
                         
                          ARTIE
           He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so
           sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK

           I assume you have everything ready

           for the dressing room?
                         
          Donkey marches in.

           Yeah, the breakfast croissants
           stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.
           Oh, and please tell me you at least
           have the saffron corn with the
           jalapeno honey butter cause our
           client cannot get into his proper
           emotional state without his
           jalapeno honey butter.
                         
                          SHREK

                          GUARD #1
           Uh...Maybe they should talk to
           Nancy in Human Resources.
                         
          Shrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the
          castle.
                         
                          PUSS

          A group of enchanted trees work on through their dance
          number.
                         
          Two dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth
          in the rear of the stage.
                         
          The camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to
          a Shrek stand in.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

           With this sword, I do- No.
                         
          He starts the line over.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           With this sword, I do smote thee!

          Without looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who
          falls to the ground.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (TO HIMSELF) )
           Is that the right word? "Smote?"
           "Smooote." Is that even a word
           actually? Maybe I should just
           smite him.
                         
          Unseen stage hands drag the stand-in away.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Let's try this again. Now...
                         
                         
          Stagehands shove another stand in onto the stage beside
          Prince Charming.

           Shrek attacks me, I pretend to be
           afraid.
           (he fake screams)
           Ooh!!!
                         
          Prince Charming does a quick mime of being afraid and
          chuckles.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I say...
           (he riffles through pages)
           "Finally the Kingdom will get the
           happily ever after they deserve,
           die Ogre", blah, blah, blah...
                         
          Without looking he stabs stand in #2. He falls to the ground.
          Prince Charming is still frustrated.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh! It just doesn't feel real
           enough yet!
                         
          He throws the sword to the ground and turns toward the
          dancing villains who are staring at him.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

          He throws the script on the ground and notices the stand-in.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And what are you laying around for?
           Get up! Honestly.
                         
          Prince Charming storms off.

          Prince Charming storms into his colossal gold leafed dressing
          room, its walls covered with posters of inspirational sayings
          and portraits of Prince Charming in different acting roles.
                         
          Slamming the door, he plops down in his throne chair in front
          of a dressing table and large 3-way mirror. A statuette of
          his mother is on the vanity. He looks at it intently.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Our happily ever after is nearly
           complete, mummy. And I assure you,
           the people of this kingdom will pay
           dearly for every second we've had
           to wait.
                         
                         
                         
          Charming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek
          standing in the doorway. Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along
          side him.
                         
          Prince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek.

           Break a leg. Or, on second
           thought, let me break it for you.
                         
          He walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his
          dressing table.
                         
          Prince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button
          under the counter.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Thank goodness you're here. I was
           beginning to think you might not
           make it back in... time.
                         
          Shrek picks him up by the front of his shirt and scowls.

           Don't worry. She and the others
           are safe. For now.
                         
          Shrek strengthens his grip.
                         
          Suddenly, a group of guards burst into the room and quickly
          surround Shrek, Artie, Puss and Donkey.

          Prince Charming smiles.
                         
          Shrek looks around and realizes he's beat. He drops Charming
          with a thud.
                         
          Prince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround
          Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming walks over to Artie. A smile grows across

           Let me guess... Arthur?
                         
          Artie looks indignant. He raises himself up.
                         
                          ARTIE

          Shrek becomes defensive.
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, I said whatever I had to say,
           alright! I wasn't right for the
           job, I just needed some fool to
           replace me, and you fit the bill.
           So just go!
                         
          Artie is stunned.

           You were playing me the whole time.

          Shrek lowers his head in shame.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You really do have a way with
           children, Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles and the guards lead Shrek off.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CHARMING'S DRESSING ROOM:
                         
          Shrek is led by the guards down the hallway.
                         
                         
          EXT. CASTLE GATE:
                         
          The scene cross-dissolves to Artie's back as he walks away
          from the castle. He gives one last look back, and angrily
          storms away.
                         
                         
          INT. DUNGEON:
                         
          Shrek's ankles and wrists are shackled. Shrek pulls on his
          chains. He sadly looks out the cell window.
                         
                         
          INT. PRISON:
                         
          The scene cross-disolves to another prison window. Fiona
          comes to the window of her prison cell. She stares
          sorrowfully at the castle in the distance.

          All of the Princesses, the Queen and Fiona are locked up in
          the same prison cell.
                         
          Cinderella is frantically scrubbing a spot on the floor to a
          shine.
                         
          Fiona looks out the cell window towards the castle in the
          distance. Behind her, Snow White paces around, complaining.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Had we just stayed put like I
           suggested, we could be sipping tea
           out of little heart-shaped cups...

           Eating crumpets smothered with
           loganberries.
                         
                          CINDERELLA

                          CINDERELLA
           Yeah, shut up.
                         
          Cinderella looks down at her reflection in the floor.
                         
                          CINDERELLA (REFLECTION)
           No! You shut up!
                         
                          CINDERELLA
           Just stay out of this!
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Who cares who's running the kingdom
           anyway?
                         
                          FIONA
           I care.
                         
          Fiona steps forward and challenges them.
                         
                          QUEEN
           And you should all care too.
                         
          Suddenly, the cell door flies open. Donkey and Puss (in each
          other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind
          them.
                         
                          PUSS

          cat.

                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Lo siento, Princessa, but I am
           Puss, stuck here inside this
           hideous body.

           I know, I know. Everything's a
           little fruity in the loops right
           now. But what happened is, we went
           to high school, the boat crashed,
           and we got "bippity-bopity-booped"
           by the "Magic Man."

                          SNOW WHITE
           The cat turned into a little horse
           that smells like feet. What's to
           get?

           Charming's got him, Princess. And
           he plans on killing Shrek tonight
           in front of the whole kingdom.
                         
          Fiona's lets out a breath.
                         
                          FIONA
           Alright everyone, we need to find a
           way out, now.
                         
          The Princesses nod in agreement.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           You're right.
           (to the other Princesses)
           Ladies, assume the position!
                         
          Sleeping Beauty falls asleep standing up. Snow White quickly
          assumes her position by lying down and puckering her lips.
          Cinderella dusts off a spot, sits down and crosses her legs.

           You have got to be kidding me.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Well, what do you expect us to do?
           We're just four...
                          (NOTICES DORIS)
           I mean, three, super hot
           princesses, two circus freaks, a
           pregnant ogre and an old lady.
                         
          The Queen smiles and then casually walks by the Princesses.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming
           through.
                         
          She walks right up to the brick wall, takes a deep breath and
          lets out a yell.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah!
                         
          She head-butts a hole right through the brick wall. Fiona
          and the Princesses are impressed.

                          QUEEN
           Well, you didn't actually think you
           got your fighting skills from your
           father, did you?
                         
          Fiona beams at her mother and then turns to the Princesses.
                         
          Snow White points to another wall behind them.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Excuse me, I think there's still
           one more.
                         
          The Queen turns and sees the another wall barring their way.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hmmmm.
                         
          The Queen hurries to the other wall.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Hiiiiyah!
                         
          It crumbles, revealing the outside. The princesses wince.
                         
          Fiona approaches her mother.
                         
          The Queen turns around, this time a little woozy, singing
          softly to herself.
                         
                          FIONA
           Why don't you just lie down?
                         
          The Queen continues to sing to herself as she walks away.
                         
          Fiona turns to the others.
                         
                          FIONA
           Okay girls, from here on out, we're
           gonna take care of business
           ourselves.
                         
          Snow thinks for a moment and then glances at the other
          Princesses. They nod.
                         
          Snow looks determined. She rips off a sleeve, revealing a
          Dopey tattoo.

          The Queen puts lipstick smudges under her eyes (a la a
          football player).
                         
          Cinderella sharpens the heal of her glass slipper.
                         
          Doris burns her bra.
                         
          The Princesses place their hands over Fiona's. Puss and
          Donkey's hands come in last.

          The camera booms down into some trees just outside of the
          castle. Fiona and the Princesses appear behind a log. Two
          Evil Trees guard the castle gate. Fiona uses a duck call to
          signal Snow White. She skips down the path toward a side
          entrance, where two Evil Trees are standing guard. Snow
          White stops in front of them, singing our version of: "Animal
          Friends/With A Smile."

           Princess, my love,
           at last you shall be freed!"
                         
          The Cherubs drop rose petals onto Prince Charming and the
          clamshell. Prince Charming and his steed, Chauncey, jump out
          of the clamshell.

           With soft and bouncy hair!"
                         
          Prince Charming begins to make his way over to the tower.

          Prince Charming dismounts, casually chops the head off of the
          sea serpent and crosses the sea.

          He makes his way to dry land. He weaves in and out of the
          Evil Trees, who are playing the part of a forest.

          He casually cuts off the head of a wooden cut-out reindeer
          and shoves a villain in a bear costume out of the way.

          There is a loud flash and a loud growling is piped through
          the sound system and flares go off as a trap door opens in
          the stage floor. Prince Charming hams it up for the
          audience, putting his hand to his ear.

          Mabel is growling through a megaphone backstage.
                         
                          MABEL
           Roar! Roar!
                         
          Three Evil Witches turn a lever and an Evil Dwarf blows some
          steam with a billow.
                         
                         
          EXT. COURTYARD STAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A large, imposing shadow grows onstage. The silhouette
          fades, revealing a shackled Shrek on stage. He pulls at his
          chains as he notes the audience and views the spectacle
          before him.

          A crowd of fans, with "SHREK" written on their stomachs,
          cheer. One of the fans is hit with an arrow. They promptly
          sit down.

          Prince Charming takes a dramatic pause and sings in an ultra-
          high voice of a castrato.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (SINGING)
           "Fear thee not Honey Lamb!
           I will slice this thing up like a
           HAM!"
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh boy.
                         
          Prince Charming relishes the moment, pulling out his sword
          and aiming it at Shrek's chest. Prince Charming's voice
          climbs even higher.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You are about to enter
           a world of pain with which you are
                          NOT-
                          (SINGING)
           "FamiliaAAAAAAR!"
                         
          He holds the last, highest note. Shrek winces. Goblets, eye
          glasses, a glass tiara and glass pearls all break in the
          audience.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles. Shrek looks at him with contempt.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well it can't be anymore painful
           than the lousy performance you're
           giving.
                         
          The audience laughs at Shrek's remark. Prince Charming is
          thrown by their reaction.
                         
          From a trap door underneath the stage Rumplestiltskin tries
          to help Prince Charming out by feeding him his next line.

           "Prepare foul beast."
                         
          He clears his throat and tries to get back into character.

           kill me, and then sing?

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming gets in Shrek's face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Be quiet!
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun
           with ya. That's actually a very
           nice leotard.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Thank you.
                         
                          SHREK
           Do they come in men's sizes?
                         
          The audience laughs again.
                         
                          HOOK
           He, he. Now that be funny.
                         
          The crowd laughs again. Shrek smiles, enjoying how he's
          screwing up the show. Prince Charming is furious.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           ENOUGH!
                         
          The crowd falls silent.
                         
          Prince Charming turns back to Shrek.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now you'll finally know what it's
           like to have everything you've
           worked for, everything that's
           precious to you taken away.
                         
          Prince Charming raises his sword.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           Now you'll know how I felt.
                         
          Suddenly a fireball hits the blade, melting it.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahhhhh!
                         
          Another huge fireball spreads across the sky as Dragon flies
          above the theater. The Dronkeys follow behind her.
                         
                          DRAGON

          The Three Pigs come running down the aisle.
                         
                          PIG #1
           Sausage Roll!!
                         
          The Three Pigs leap onto the stage, going into a drop and
          roll move to land in between Shrek and Prince Charming. They
          strike a fighting pose.
                         
          Pinocchio comes flying in on his strings, landing with a
          flurry of kung-fu hands.
                         
          The Wolf unzips the wolf costume, steps out and joins the
          others.

          Gingerbread Man pops up in the tower window, grabs Rapunzel's
          hair and swings down. Before he hits the ground, the end
          catches and he bounces like a bungee jumper. Her hair falls
          into a pile next to a very surprised Gingerbread Man.
                         
          Rapunzel screams. Her mousy brown hair crammed under a hair
          net. She runs off crying.
                         
          Prince Charming looks around, almost surrounded.
                         
          Suddenly a shadow falls over the crowd and they gasp. Dragon
          and the Dronkeys fly in and land on the stage.
                         
          Puss and Donkey leap off her back to the stage.
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss's body)

           ...Puss!
                         
          He claps his hooves on the stage.
                         
                          DONKEY

          He carves a letter "D" on Pinocchio's bottom.

          The Queen head-butts through one of the backdrops, with
          Sleeping Beauty and Doris. Snow White flies in behind them
          with the help of her woodland creatures ("Crouching Tiger,
          Hidden Dragon" style). Cinderella runs on stage equipped with
          a mop as her weapon. Together, the Princesses strike fierce
          poses and stand next to Shrek.
                         
          The audience applauds.
                         
          Suddenly the front door of the "swamp house" set crashes to
          the floor, revealing Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           Hi honey! Sorry we're late. You
           okay?
                         
                          SHREK
           Much better, now that you're here.
                         
                          AUDIENCE
           Awwwwwww!
                         
          The audience applauds. Shrek turns to Prince Charming
          raising his shackled wrists.
                         
                          SHREK
           So Charming, you wanna let me out
           of these so we can settle this ogre
           to man?
                         
          Prince Charming considers this for a second.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oooh, that sounds fun. But I have
           a better idea!
                         
          Prince Charming strikes an imperious pose and claps his
          hands. Cyclops suddenly emerges from the trap door, knocking
          Puss and Donkey down. He approaches them menacingly.
                         
          The witches fly in and threaten the princesses with their
          brooms. The Evil Queen rises up behind the Queen and puts a
          knife to her throat.
                         
          The Evil Dwarves grab The Three Pigs. Gingerbread Man is
          suddenly surrounded by many Evil Knights. He poops out a gum-
          ball.
                         
          Dragon starts to move forward only to find herself surrounded
          by crossbows. A bunch of pirates grab Fiona and tie her up.

           No! Let go of me!
                         
          Shrek struggles to free himself of the chains, but it's no
          use.
                         
          Prince Charming's eyes narrow.

           Kill it!
                         
          Prince Charming signals to the villains to attack Shrek. As
          the villains advance towards Shrek, a spotlight shines in
          their eyes, stopping them in their tracks.
                         
                          ARTIE

           Artie?
                         
          Artie jumps from the spotlight.
                         
          Artie lands clumsily on a hanging cloud.
                         
          Artie leaps awkwardly from cloud to cloud. The audience
          stares in awe.
                         
          After one last leap, he swings down on the Cherub's cable,
          sending the little person up in the air.
                         
          Artie lands on the stage in between the Villains and Shrek.
          He stands facing the Villains.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Who really thinks we need to settle
           things this way?
                         
          The Evil Knights think about it and raise their hands. The
          other Villains follow suit.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You're telling me you just want to
           be Villains your whole lives?
                         
          This gives the Villains pause.

           But we are Villains. It's the only
           thing we know.

           Didn't you ever wish you could be
           something else?
                         
          The Villains aren't convinced.
                         
                          EVIL TREE #2
           Well, it's easy for you to say.
           You're not some evil enchanted
           tree.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You morons! Don't listen to him!
                          ATTACK THEM-
                         
          Another Evil Tree covers Prince Charming's mouth and then
          motions to Artie.
                         
                          EVIL TREE #1
           What Steve's trying to say here is
           that it's hard to come by honest
           work when the whole world's against
           you.
                         
                          EVIL TREE #2
           Right, thanks Ed.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay, fair enough. You're right.
           I'm not a talking tree. But, ya
           know, a good friend of mine once
           told me that just because people
           treat you like a villain, or an
           ogre...
                         
          Artie shares a look with Shrek.
                         
                          ARTIE
           ... or just some loser...
                         
          The Fairy-tale Villains listen intently.
                         
                          ARTIE (CONT'D)
           ...it doesn't mean you are one.
                         
          The Evil Tree tightens his grip as Prince Charming struggles
          to break free.

           The thing that matters most is what
           you think of yourself.
                         
          Artie commands the stage.
                         
                          ARTIE (CONT'D)
           If there's something you really
           want, or there's someone you really
           want to be, then the only person

          Artie points at Rumplestiltskin directly in front of him.
          Rumplestiltskin is alarmed.
                         
                          RUMPLESTILTSKIN
           Me?

                          ARTIE
           No, no, no! What I mean is: each
           of you is standing in your own way!

           Oooooooh!
                         
          The Headless Horseman breaks through the crowd.
                         
                          HEADLESS HORSEMAN
           I've always wanted to play the
           flute.
                         
          The Fairy-tale Villains and Creatures look at each other.
          The Evil Queen steps up.
                         
                          EVIL QUEEN
           I`d like to open up a spa in
           France.
                         
          The Villains nod in agreement.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           I grow daffodils!
                         
          Complete silence as everyone stares at Hook.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           And they're beautiful!
                         
          Captain Hook looks thoughtfully at his sword, then throws it
          down.

          The pirates throw theirs down, followed by the witches and
          Evil Knights. The evil knight holding Pinocchio is thinking
          about it when Pinocchio reaches over and takes the ax from
          him. The weapons pile up in the middle of the stage. Everyone
          else cheers and starts to mingle, introducing themselves and
          shaking hands.
                         
          Gingerbread Man high fives with an Evil Knight. Fiona is
          untied.
                         
          Mabel walks up to Doris and lightly punches her on the jaw.
          Doris returns the sign of affection by punching Mabel in the
          jaw, but a bit too hard, sending her falling to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, Prince Charming kicks himself free of the Evil Tree
          and charges them. He grabs a sword from the discard pile and
          raises it up, his aim set at Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Aaaahhhh!
                         
          Despite his fear, Artie faces Prince Charming bravely. As
          Prince Charming charges, Shrek finds the strength to break
          his chains. Just before Prince Charming strikes, a chain
          whips into frame, wrapping around the sword. Shrek pulls
          Prince Charming around in a circle, away from Artie. Furious,
          he charges Shrek and stabs him with the sword. Charming lets
          go and Shrek stumbles back with the weapon impaled in him,
          and falls to the floor, groaning.
                         
          Prince Charming beams, and laughs. He turns to the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           A new era finally begins!
                         
          The audience cowers.
                         
          Shrek looks up smiling and nods at Fiona and Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now, all of you, bow before your
           king!
                         
          Shrek casually rises up behind him and clears his throat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah-hem.
                         
          Charming turns around. Shrek lifts his arm revealing that he
          was never really stabbed.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           You need to work on your aim.

          Charming is stunned.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           This was supposed to be my happily
           ever after.
                         
          Prince Charming is paralyzed. Shrek drops the sword and grabs
          him by the shirt-front, lifting him off of his feet.
                         
          He winces, but is still defiant.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well I guess you need to keep
           looking...
                         
          Shrek looks at Fiona and at his friends and smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           ...cause I'm not giving up mine.
                         
          Shrek sets Prince Charming down and signals DRAGON. She
          casually tips the tower over with her tail. A shadow falls
          over Prince Charming. He turns and sees the tower falling
          toward him, his body perfectly framed up in the princesses's
          window.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Mommy?
                         
          It crashes down and he's trapped inside.
                         
          As the dust clears, the crown rolls across the stage. Artie
          stops it with his foot and slowly picks it up.
                         
                          SHREK
           It's yours if you want it, you
           know, but this time it's your
           choice.
                         
          Artie considers it.
                         
          He looks at Shrek, who is smiling proudly at him.
                         
          Artie turns to the audience and holds out the crown to them.
          They cheer him.
                         
          Artie places the crown on his head. The crowd goes nuts. In
          the audience, Raul sobs with joy.
                         
                          ALL

          Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put
          Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and
          Puss, still in each other's bodies, watch as Artie gets
          carried away.
                         
          In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around
          confused, clutching his show ticket.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, excuse me, that's my seat.
                         
          Suddenly he is thrown back against the front of the stage as
          Donkey and Puss confront him.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The
           time has come to rectify some
           wrongs!
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)
           Although I have been enjoying these
           "cat baths."
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Please say you didn't.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh... alright, alright...look..
                         
          Merlin rubs his hands together.
                         
                          MERLIN
           You're gonna feel a little pinch,
           and possibly some lower intestinal
           discomfort, but this should do the
           trick.
                         
          Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the
          magic. He lets loose with a bright burst of magic. It takes a
          moment for Donkey and Puss to recover. They eye each other
          cautiously.
                         
                          PUSS
           Are you..?
                         
          Donkey lifts his hoof and inspects it carefully.

          Puss checks out his own paws.
                         
                          PUSS
           And I am not you!
                         
          Donkey and Puss give each other a big hug.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Alright!
                         
          The two of them turn and walk away together.
                         
          Merlin is behind them, smoking fingers and all. Suddenly his
          eyes grow wide.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oops. Ah, never mind.
                         
          We see that Donkey still has Puss' tail and Puss had
          Donkey's. Merlin slips away.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona watch Artie in the distance.

           Well, for what it's worth, you
           would have too.
                         
          Shrek smiles, and touches Fiona's belly.
                         
                          SHREK
           I have something much more
           important in mind.
                         
          They kiss.
                         
          The camera pulls back to see everyone celebrating around
          Shrek and Fiona as they kiss.

          Shrek grabs a "gourd" bottle and creates an ogre shake out of
          slug juice, eye balls and worms. He walk over to join Fiona
          by the fire.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah, finally.
                         
          Shrek gives Fiona the "gourd" bottle and she places a nipple
          on it. Two ogre babies crawl up onto Fiona's lap.
                         
                          OGRE BABIES
           Da da.
                         
          A third ogre baby appears at Shrek's feet. He bends down to
          pick him up.
                         
          One big happy family of five. Shrek laughs and gives the
          babies and Fiona a hug.
                         
          The front door opens up to reveal Puss and Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Hey! I smell Shrek Jr.
                         
          The Dronkeys come swarming in behind Donkey. Dragon peers in
          through the door.
                         
          Shrek with a safety pin in his mouth is doing his best at
          changing diapers. He twists the diaper around and the baby
          goes flying off screen and lands in a diaper that Fiona is
          holding. She smiles at Shrek.
                         
          The swamp house is overrun with Dronkeys, ogre babies and
          dirty diapers.
                         
          Puss sits next to an ogre baby that has a pacifier in his
          mouth. He takes the pacifier out of his mouth, shoves it in
          Puss' mouth and gives Puss a big hug. Another baby comes
          crawling into frame and starts to tug on Puss' tail. A tug
          of war ensues.
                         
          The ogre babies are bathing in a pot of water (a la a beat
          from the Nightmare scene). One of the babies farts in the
          water as Shrek comes in and scoops them up. Shrek laughs.
                         
                         
                         
          Donkey is playing "peek-a-boo" with his ears. A baby ogre
          laughs.

           Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.
                         
          A baby ogre pulls ear wax from Shrek's ear. The baby uses
          the wax to draw squiggly lines on a piece of paper.
                         
                          QUEEN
           Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy boy.
                         
          The Queen is bouncing a baby ogre on her lap. The baby pukes
          and the Queen smiles.
                         
          There is a knock at the door. Donkey is laying on the floor
          holding a bottle with all four hooves, drinking the milk.
                         
          Shrek grabs the bottle out of Donkey's mouth.

          door.

          Fiona slides one of the babies down a "slip `n slide" made

          Shrek and Fiona are diapering two of the babies in perfect
          unison. They continue diapering, Fiona holds up the third
          baby and Shrek holds up an unhappy, diapered Puss.
                         
          Shrek grabs a gourd bottle off of a shelf. He tosses it to

          the gourd thrown to her, twirls it around (a la Tom Cruise in
          Cocktail), lifts up her leg where another baby is perched on
          her foot and puts the gourd in the baby's mouth.
                         
          Shrek is burping a baby over his shoulder. The baby burps.
          Fiona has a baby over her shoulder and the baby burps. A
          Dronkey sitting on a chair does a flame-belch and an ogre
          baby crawling by farts which causes a flame thrower effect
          into the fireplace.

               LIGHT, the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid, 
               say, a hangover.

               Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND 
               comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes 
               some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work.

               He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked 
               far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car 
               starts fitfully.

               He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his 
               hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just 
               anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and

                         by noon, but there's been all this 
                         work going on at my building, and 
                         it's like a total nightmare, and I

               PAN TO MILES as he signals to change lanes. The finished 
               puzzle lies on the passenger seat.

               EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY

               The houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many 
               affluent Southern California suburbs.

               Miles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and 
               two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door.

               INT. ERGANIAN HOUSE - DAY

               A GIANT PROJECTION TV --

               In a large split-level living room displays a GOLF TOURNAMENT.

               WIDE --

               Watching from the ultra-comfortable furniture are MIKE 
               ERGANIAN, a tanned, silver-haired real estate caudillo; bride-
               to-be CHRISTINE ERGANIAN, his oldest daughter; and JACK 
               LOPATE, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip-flops.

               MRS. ERGANIAN, a warm and elegant housewife, shows Miles 
               into the room.

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                         Look what the cat dragged!

                                     MILES
                         Hi, everybody.

               Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with 
               Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine 
               irritation.

                                     JACK
                         About time you got here, bud. Mr. 
                         Prompt.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         We were thinking maybe you took the 
                         wrong way and went to Tijuana and 
                         they didn't let you back in.

               The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too.

                                     MILES
                         I had to bribe them.

               More lame laughter.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Hey, Miles.

                                     MILES
                              (leaning in to kiss 
                              Christine)
                         Seriously though, the freeway was 
                         unbelievable today. Unbelievable. 
                         Bumper to bumper the whole way. People 
                         getting an early start on the weekend, 
                         I guess. Granted I got a late start, 
                         but still.

               Although Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps 
               watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles.

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                         Christine, why don't you ask Miles 
                         about the cake?

                                     CHRISTINE
                         Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to 
                         the kitchen with me.

                                     JACK
                         Don't bother him with that. We got 
                         to get going.

                                     CHRISTINE
                              (taking Miles's hand)
                         It'll just take a second.

               INT. ERGANIAN KITCHEN - DAY

               Jack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate 
               with two pieces of CAKE -- one white, one dark.

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                         Jack tells us you are publishing a 
                         book. Congratulations.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         Yes, congratulations.

               Miles shoots Jack a look. Mr. Erganian gets some ice cubes 
               from the refrigerator door.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized 
                         yet, but, um, there has been some 
                         interest and --

                                     MRS. ERGANIAN
                              (to Jack)
                         Your friend is modest.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest. 
                         Indulge them. Don't make me out to 
                         be a liar.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         What subject is your book? Non-
                         fiction?

                                     MILES
                         No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although 
                         there's a lot from my own life, so I 
                         guess technically some of it is non-
                         fiction.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         Good, I like non-fiction. There is 
                         so much to know about the world that 
                         I think reading a story someone just 
                         invented is kind of a waste of time.

                                     CHRISTINE
                         So which one do you like better?

                                     MILES
                         I like them both, but if pressed I'd 
                         have to say I prefer the dark.

                                     JACK
                              (to Christine)
                         See?

               INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

               IN A REAR VIEW MIRROR --

               The Erganians wave good-bye.

               INSIDE THE CAR --

               Miles accelerates as he and Jack wave back.

                                     JACK
                         Where the fuck were you, man? I was 
                         dying in there. We were supposed to 
                         be a hundred miles away by now.

                                     MILES
                         I can't help the traffic.

                                     JACK
                         Come on. You're fucking hungover.

                                     MILES
                         Okay, there was a tasting last night. 
                         But I wanted to get us some stuff 
                         for the ride up. Check out the box.

               Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD 
               WINE BOX.

                                     MILES
                         Why did you tell them my book was 
                         being published?

                                     JACK
                         You said you had it all lined up.

                                     MILES
                         No, I didn't. What I said was that 
                         my agent had heard there was some 
                         interest at Conundrum...

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, Conundrum.

                                     MILES
                         ...and that one of the editors was 
                         passing it up to a senior editor. 
                         She was supposed to hear something 
                         this week, but now it's next week, 
                         and... It's always like this. It's 
                         always a fucking waiting game. I've 
                         been through it too many times 
                         already.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds 
                         like you're in to me.

                                     MILES
                         It's a long shot, all right? And 
                         Conundrum is just a small specialty 
                         press anyway. I'm not getting my 
                         hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's 
                         it. I've stopped caring.

               Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE 
               and TWO GLASSES.

                                     JACK
                         But I know it's going to happen this 
                         time. I can feel it. This is the 
                         one. I'm proud of you, man. You're 
                         the smartest guy I know.

               Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.

                                     MILES
                         Don't open that now. It's warm.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, we're celebrating. I say we 
                         pop it.

                                     MILES
                         That's a 1992 Byron. It's really 
                         rare. Don't open it now. I've been 
                         saving it!

               Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a 
               fountain of champagne erupts.

                                     MILES
                         For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just 
                         wasted like half of it!

               Jack begins pouring two glasses.

                                     JACK
                         Shut up.
                              (handing Miles a glass)
                         Here's to a great week.

                                     MILES
                              (coming around)
                         Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass 
                         behavior, I'm really glad we're 
                         finally getting this time together.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah.

                                     MILES
                         You know how long I've been begging 
                         to take you on the wine tour. I was 
                         beginning to think it was never going 
                         to happen.

               They clink and drink.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, that's tasty.

                                     MILES
                         100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. 
                         They don't even make it anymore.

                                     JACK
                         Pinot Noir? How come it's white? 
                         Doesn't noir mean dark?

                                     MILES
                         Jesus. Don't ask questions like that 
                         up in the wine country. They'll think 
                         you're a moron.

                                     JACK
                         Just tell me.

                                     MILES
                         Color in the red wines comes from 
                         the skins. This juice is free run, 
                         so there's no skin contact in the 
                         fermentation, ergo no color.

                                     JACK
                              (not really listening)
                         Sure is tasty.

               The boys continue to drink and drive.

                                     MILES
                         Did you read the latest draft, by 
                         the way?

                                     JACK
                         Oh, yeah. Yeah.

                                     MILES
                         And?

                                     JACK
                         I liked it a lot. A lot of 
                         improvements. It just seemed overall, 
                         I don't know, tighter, more... 
                         congealed or something.

                                     MILES
                         How about the new ending? Did you 
                         like that?

                                     JACK
                         Oh yeah. Much better.

                                     MILES
                         There is no new ending. Page 750 on 
                         is exactly the same.

                                     JACK
                         Well, then I guess it must have felt 
                         new because everything leading up to 
                         it was so different.

               INT. GAS STATION #1 - DAY

               Miles is pumping gas. Jack is stretching his legs nearby or 
               perhaps cleaning the windshield.

               A CELLPHONE RINGS. Jack reaches into his pocket.

                                     JACK
                              (looking at the phone)
                         It's Christine.
                              (snapping it open)
                         Hey you.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON PHONE)
                         You guys having fun?

               Christine's voice is so loud that Jack has to hold the phone 
               away from his ear.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have 
                         been a blast.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Good. That's good.

               A silence, then --

                                     JACK
                         So what's up?

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Just seeing how you're doing. And, 
                         um, Mom and I were starting to look 
                         over the seating charts again, and 
                         we're wondering if you wanted Tony 
                         Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, 
                         or should he be at one of the singles 
                         tables?

               Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         So what do you think? With the 
                         Feldmans?

               Jack hasn't even really heard the question.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. The Feldmans.

               As the conversation continues, Miles replaces the GAS PUMP, 
               screws the GAS CAP back on, and together the guys get back 
               into the car. We DRIVE AWAY WITH THEM.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Really? Because I don't know, I was 
                         thinking that --

                                     JACK
                         Well, then put him at the singles 
                         table.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         The problem with that is that then 
                         there's one extra --

                                     JACK
                         Then put him with the Feldmans. 
                         Whatever you and your Mom decide is 
                         fine with me.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to 
                         include you in this decision. He's 
                         your friend.

                                     JACK
                         I didn't dismiss you. I told you 
                         what I thought, but it didn't seem 
                         to matter, so you decide. Besides, 
                         this is supposed to be my time with 
                         Miles. I hope you're not going to 
                         call every five minutes.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm not going to call every five 
                         minutes, but this is important.

                                     JACK
                         Honey, I'm just saying you know I 
                         need a little space before the 
                         wedding. Isn't that the point of 
                         this? Isn't that what we talked about 
                         with Dr. Gertler?

               A silence. Then --

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Why are you being so defensive?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know, Christine. Perhaps 
                         it's because I feel attacked.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         I ask you one simple question, and 
                         suddenly I'm attacking you.

                                     JACK
                         Listen. I'll call you when we get 
                         there, and we can talk about it then, 
                         okay?

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Bye.

                                     JACK
                         I love you.

                                     CHRISTINE (ON THE PHONE)
                         Bye.

               Jack SLAMS his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage.

                                     MILES
                         Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite 
                         Tony Levin?

               EXT. 405 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Saab heads north -- now passing through LOS ANGELES.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - LATE AFTERNOON

               Miles signals and begins to head for an EXIT.

                                     JACK
                         Whoa, why are we getting off?

                                     MILES
                         I've just got to make one quick stop. 
                         Won't take a second.  

                                     JACK
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         I thought we could just say a quick 
                         hello to my mother.

                                     JACK
                         Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were 
                         supposed to be up there hours ago.

                                     MILES
                         It's her birthday tomorrow. And I 
                         don't feel right driving by her house 
                         and not stopping in, okay? It'll 
                         just take a second. She's right off 
                         the freeway.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Saab takes an EXIT.

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         How old's she going to be?

                                     MILES (O.S.)
                         Um... seventy... something.

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         That's a good age.

               OMIT.

               OMIT. 

               EXT. CONDO COMMUNITY STREET - DUSK

               The Saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest CONDO.

               SUPERIMPOSE:

                                    OXNARD, CALIFORNIA

               EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - DUSK

               Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS 
               out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of 
               CHAMPAGNE.

               Miles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too.

                                     MILES
                         Wait a second.

               He pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the 
               envelope, Jack rings the bell.

               Moments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly 
               older woman in a nightgown and housecoat.

                                     MILES AND JACK
                         Surprise! Happy Birthday!

               The boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs 
               slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating 
               of her own.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         My God. Miles. And Jack! What a 
                         surprise. I can't remember the last 
                         time you brought me flowers.

               They hug.

                                     JACK
                         They're from both of us.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         A famous actor bringing me flowers 
                         on my birthday. Don't I feel special?

                                     MILES
                         A famous actor who's getting married 
                         next week.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I 
                         hope that girls knows how lucky she 
                         is, marrying no less than Derek 
                         Summersby.

               The boys follow her inside.

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

                                     JACK
                         Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven 
                         years ago.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Well, you were wonderful on that 
                         show. I never understood why they 
                         had to give you that brain tumor so 
                         soon. Why that didn't make you the 
                         biggest movie star in the world is a 
                         sin. It's a sin.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, well, you should be my agent.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         If I was, I would sing your praises 
                         up and down the street until they 
                         put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, 
                         why didn't you tell me you were coming 
                         and bringing this handsome man? Look 
                         how I'm dressed. I've got to run and 
                         put my face on.  

                                     JACK
                         You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (over her shoulder)
                         Oh, stop it. Make yourselves 
                         comfortable.
                              (now around the corner)
                         You boys hungry?

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I'm hungry.

               Jack gives Miles a look.

                                     MILES
                              (low)
                         Just a snack. Calm down.

               Miles leads Jack into this small condo. The TV is on, and 
               it's MESSY. Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an 
               AB-ROLLER and an ancient SCHWINN EXER-CYCLE sit forgotten in 
               a corner.

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Miles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it 
               fills with water in the sink. He puts the champagne in and 
               carries it into the --

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching 
               WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?

                                     MILES
                         Let me show you something. The secret 
                         to opening champagne is that once 
                         the cork is released, you keep 
                         pressure on it so you don't --

                                     JACK
                              (concentrated on the 
                              TV)
                         Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.

               Miles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence.

                                     PHYLLIS (O.S.)
                         Ready for my close up!

               The boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up 
               and a PANTSUIT. Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed. 
               Overall she looks much worse than before.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you 
                         bring that out onto the lanai? I 
                         thought we could eat on the lanai.

               EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT

               Miles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular 
               glass table. They are mid-meal.

               Everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the 
               birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another 
               plate of food.

                                     JACK
                         Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. 
                         Absolutely delicious.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (sitting)
                         They're just leftovers.

                                     JACK
                         Is it chicken?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I could have made something fancier 
                         if a certain someone had let me know 
                         that a certain someone was coming 
                         for a visit with a certain special 
                         friend. Could have made a pork roast.

                                     MILES
                         It was a surprise, Mom.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And I could have already put clean 
                         sheets on the other bed and the fold-
                         out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and 
                         the twins are picking us up at 11:30 
                         to go to brunch at the Sheraton. 
                         They do a magnificent job there. 
                         Wendy is so excited you're coming.

               Silence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth.

                                     MILES
                         You talked to Wendy?

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Just now. She's thrilled. And the 
                         kids.

                                     MILES
                              (trying to be chipper)
                         Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty 
                         eager to get up to... you know, but, 
                         uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Well, you boys do what you want. I 
                         just think it would be nice for us 
                         to be together as a family on my 
                         birthday.

                                     MILES
                         Uh-huh.
                              (wiping his mouth)
                         I'll be right back.

               He gets up and heads into the house.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Miles heads toward...

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...and goes directly to her dresser, opening a drawer filled 
               with bras, panties and stockings.

               He burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a 
               CAN OF RAID. A can of Raid?

               He twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it 
               to be a SECRET STASH for valuables disguised as a common 
               household product. Inside are stacks of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR 
               BILLS.

                                     MILES
                              (quickly peeling some 
                              off)
                         ...six, seven, eight,...
                              (one more for good 
                              luck)
                         Nine.

               His task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs 
               the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon FRAMED PHOTOS 
               atop the dresser --

               -- A proud NINE-YEAR-OLD MILES poses in front of his childhood 
               San Diego home, showing off a WAGON filled with freshly 
               harvested lettuce. On the wagon is a hand-lettered sign --
               "10 cents a bunch."

               -- A Sears portrait shows the RAYMOND FAMILY: a much younger 
               Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year-
               old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy.

               -- Miles at his wedding. He and his bride VICTORIA look young 
               and attractive, their faces radiant and hopeful.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Miles enters, flushes the toilet and leaves.

               EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT

               As Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack 
               is pouring Phyllis another glass.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         And what was that other one you did, 
                         the one where you're the jogger?

                                     JACK
                         Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That 
                         was for Spray and Wash.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         Spray and Wash. That's the one.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, I remember the girl who was in 
                         it with me. She was something.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I just remember you jogging. So when's 
                         the wedding?

                                     MILES
                              (irritated)
                         This Saturday, Mom, remember? We 
                         told you.

                                     JACK
                         And Miles is my best man, Mrs. 
                         Raymond. My main man.

                                     PHYLLIS
                              (another drink of 
                              wine)
                         Miles, when are you going to get 
                         married again?

                                     MILES
                         I just got divorced. Phyllis.

                                     JACK
                         Two years ago, buddy.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You should get back together with 
                         Victoria. She was good for you.

               Embarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         She was good for you.
                              (turning to Jack)
                         And so beautiful and intelligent. 
                         You knew her, right?

                                     JACK
                         Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you 
                         need some money?

                                     MILES
                         I'm fine.

               Miles takes another drink of wine.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               UNDER BLACK, a CARD --

                                          SUNDAY

                                     MILES (O.S.)
                         Jack. Jack.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY

               Jack finally awakens with a start and finds Miles standing 
               above him, shaking him.

               WIDE --

               As Jack gets up, we see he has crashed on Phyllis's bed 
               adorned with all her decorative PILLOWS.

               INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies 
               sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never 
               turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON.

               As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward 
               the TV to turn it off. Miles waves him off.

                                     MILES
                              (a loud whisper)
                         She'll wake up.

               As they leave and Miles closes the front door quietly behind 
               him, we PAN to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a 
               side table.

               INT. ROADSIDE IHOP - DAY

               TWO PLATES OF FOOD float in front of two breasts tucked inside 
               a zippered uniform.

               WIDER --

               Disheveled and unshaven, Jack and Miles are served breakfast 
               by a young, innocently sexy WAITRESS. Jack leers after her.

                                     JACK
                         Fuck, man. Too early in the morning 
                         for that, you know what I mean?

                                     MILES
                         She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look 
                         at that stuff anymore.

                                     JACK
                         That's your problem, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         As if she'd even be attracted to 
                         guys like us in the first place.

                                     JACK
                         Speak for yourself. I get chicks 
                         looking at me all the time. All ages.

                                     MILES
                         It's not worth it. You pay too big a 
                         price. It's never free.

               They eat in silence a moment.

                                     JACK
                         You need to get laid.

               Miles shrugs off the comment.

                                     JACK
                         It'd be the best thing for you. You 
                         know what? I'm going to get you laid 
                         this week. That's going to be my 
                         best man gift to you. I'm not going 
                         to give you a pen knife or a gift 
                         certificate or any of that other 
                         horseshit.

                                     MILES
                         I'd rather have a knife.

                                     JACK
                         No. No. You've been officially 
                         depressed for like two years now, 
                         and you were always a negative guy 
                         anyway, even in college. Now it's 
                         worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching 
                         English to fucking eighth-graders 
                         when they should be reading what you 
                         wrote. Your books.

                                     MILES
                         I'm working on it.

               Miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns

                                     JACK
                         You still seeing that shrink?

                                     MILES
                         I went on Monday. But I spent most 
                         of the time helping him with his 
                         computer.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I say fuck therapy and what's 
                         that stuff you take, Xanax?

                                     MILES
                         And Lexapro, yes.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I say fuck that. You need to 
                         get your joint worked on, that's 
                         what you need.

                                     MILES
                         Jack. This week is not about me. 
                         It's about you. I'm going to show 
                         you a good time. We're going to drink 
                         a lot of good wine, play some golf, 
                         eat some great food, enjoy the scenery 
                         and send you off in style.

                                     JACK
                         And get your bone smooched.

               Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions 
               for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be 
               right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to 
               signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching 
               him.

                                     JACK
                         What?

               EXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY

               In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN --
               makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that 
               those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.

               MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the 
               rhythm of a road trip.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward 
               Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open 
               car.

                                     MILES
                         You know what? Let's take the Santa 
                         Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.

                                     JACK
                         Whatever's closest, man. I need a 
                         glass.

                                     MILES
                         These guys make top-notch Pinot and 
                         Chardonnay. One of the best producers 
                         in Santa Barbara county.
                              (looking out the window)
                         Look how beautiful this view is. 
                         What a day!

                                     JACK
                         I thought you hated Chardonnay.

                                     MILES
                         I like all varietals. I just don't 
                         generally like the way they manipulate 
                         Chardonnay in California -- too much 
                         oak and secondary malolactic 
                         fermentation.

               EXT. SANTA ROSA TURN-OFF - DAY

               The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.

                                     MILES
                         Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? 
                         And the ocean's just right over that 
                         ridge. See, the reason this region's 
                         great for Pinot is that the cold air 
                         off the Pacific flows in at night 
                         through these transverse valleys and 
                         cools down the berries. Pinot's a 
                         very thin-skinned grape and doesn't 
                         like heat or humidity.

               Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and 
               articulateness.

               The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long 
               gravel DRIVEWAY.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel 
                         sells.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks, Jack. So do I.
                              (noticing)
                         Here we are.

               EXT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY

               Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they 
               get out and walk --

                                     MILES
                         So what'd you guys finally decide on 
                         for the menu?

                                     JACK
                         I told you. Filet and salmon.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, but how are they making the 
                         salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill 
                         sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always 
                         have white wine with fish?

                                     MILES
                         Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we 
                         have to find out because it's going 
                         to make a big difference.

                                     JACK
                              (taking out his phone)
                         Let me call Christine.

                                     MILES
                         Doesn't have to be now. Let's go 
                         taste.

                                     JACK
                         I owe her a call anyway.

               Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room 
               as Jack SPEED DIALS.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, honey. So we're up here about 
                         to taste some whites, and we need to 
                         know how the caterers are going to 
                         make the salmon.

               Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.

                                     JACK
                         No, I know, I didn't forget, but we 
                         wound up at Miles's mom's house, and 
                         it got really late, and it was hard 
                         to call, so I'm calling you now. I 
                         said I was sorry. Yes, I did.
                              (to Miles)
                         You heard me say I was sorry, right?

               Miles just shrugs.

                                     JACK
                         Miles heard me say I was sorry.

               As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he 
               wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of 
               earshot.

                                     JACK
                         Give me a break, will you? I just 
                         called to find out about the salmon -- 
                         for our wedding -- to be more 
                         involved, like you said -- and all 
                         you want to do is get into it about 
                         last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm 
                         sorry I didn't call. You're totally 
                         right. I know, but I'm trying to 
                         make this the best wedding I can 
                         with the best wine we can find. Don't 
                         I get any credit for that? Okay. 
                         Look, I've got to go. I'm out here 
                         in the parking lot, and Miles is 
                         waiting for me...

               And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling. Miles decides 
               to head inside.

               INT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY

               Miles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him. Jack walks 
               in and bellies up next to him.

                                     JACK
                              (proudly)
                         Baked with a butter-lime glaze.

                                     MILES
                         Now we're talking.

               CHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes 
               over.

                                     CHRIS
                         This is the condemned man?

                                     MILES
                         Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.

               Chris and Jack shake hands.

                                     JACK
                         How you doing?

                                     CHRIS
                         You guys want to start with the Vin 
                         Gris?

                                     JACK
                         Sounds good.

               TWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN 
               GRIS.

                                     JACK
                         This is rose, right?

                                     MILES
                         Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this 
                         one is rather atypically made from 
                         100% Pinot Noir.

                                     JACK
                         Pinot noir? Not again!
                              (joking, to Chris)
                         You know, not all Pinots are noir.

               They laugh.

               Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then 
               lifts it to smell. Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps 
               even spilling some wine in the process.

                                     MILES
                         Let me show you.

               We see details of what Miles now describes.

                                     MILES
                         First take your glass and examine 
                         the wine against the light. You're 
                         looking at color and clarity.

                                     JACK
                         What color is it supposed to be?

                                     MILES
                         Depends on the varietal. Just get a 
                         sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? 
                         Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...

                                     JACK
                         Huh.

                                     MILES
                         Now tip it. What you're doing here 
                         is checking for color density as it 
                         thins toward the rim. Tells you how 
                         old it is, among other things, usually 
                         more important with reds. This is a 
                         very young wine, so it's going to 
                         retain its color pretty solidly. Now 
                         stick your nose in it.

               Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume 
               bottle.

                                     MILES
                         Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.

               Jack now buries his nose in the glass.

                                     MILES
                         What do you smell?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?

               Miles smells.

                                     MILES
                         There's not much there yet, but you 
                         can still find...
                              (more sniffs)
                         ...a little citrus... maybe some 
                         strawberry... passion fruit... and 
                         there's even a hint of like 
                         asparagus... or like a nutty Edam 
                         cheese.

               Jack smells again and begins to brighten.

                                     JACK
                         Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, 
                         strawberry. I'm not so sure about 
                         the cheese.

                                     MILES
                         Now set your glass down and get some 
                         air into it.

               Miles expertly swirls the wine. Jack follows suit.

                                     MILES
                         Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks 
                         the aroma and the flavors. Very 
                         important. Now we smell again.

               They do so. Jack smiles.

                                     MILES
                         That's what you do with every one.

                                     JACK
                         When do we get to drink it?

                                     MILES
                         Now.

               Jack gulps his wine down in one shot. Miles chews his before 
               swallowing.

                                     JACK
                         How would you rate this one?

                                     MILES
                         Usually they start you on the wines 
                         with learning disabilities, but this 
                         one's pretty damn good.
                              (to Chris)
                         This is the new one, right, Chris?

                                     CHRIS
                         Released it about two months ago.

                                     MILES
                         Nice job.

                                     CHRIS
                         We like it.

                                     JACK
                              (to Miles)
                         You know, you could work in a wine 
                         store.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, that would be a good move.

               Now Miles notices something about Jack.

                                     MILES
                         Are you chewing gum?

                                     JACK
                         Want some?

                                         BUELLTON

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look --
               there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless.  

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto 
               their respective beds.

               LATER --

               The sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the 
               bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds 
               on the wall.

                                     MILES
                         Hey Jack, hurry up!

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         Just a minute!

               Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and 
               tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK

               Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble 
               along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They 
               pass a mall and a car dealership.

                                     JACK
                         I thought you said it was close. Now 
                         I'm all pitted out.

                                     MILES
                         It's not even a mile.

                                     JACK
                         We should have driven.

                                     MILES
                         Not with the wine list these people 
                         have. We don't want to hold back.

                                     JACK
                         You think I'm making a mistake 
                         marrying Christine?

                                     MILES
                         Whoa.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, do you think I'm doing the 
                         right thing? Tell the truth. You've 
                         been through it.

                                     MILES
                         Well, you waited for good reason, 
                         and you proposed to Christine for 
                         some good reason. So I think it's 
                         great. It's time. You've got to have 
                         your eyes open, that's all. I mean, 
                         look at me. I thought Victoria and I 
                         were set for life.

                                     JACK
                         Christine's dad -- he's been talking 
                         about bringing me into his property 
                         business. Showing me the ropes. And 
                         that's something, considering how 
                         long it took him to get over I'm not 
                         Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. 
                         But I don't know, might get a little 
                         incestuous. But Mike does pretty 
                         well. A lot of high-end commercial 
                         stuff.

                                     MILES
                         So you're going to stop acting?

                                     JACK
                         No way. This would just provide some 
                         stability is what I'm saying. I can 
                         always squeeze in an audition or a 
                         commercial here and there, you know, 
                         keep myself in the game in case 
                         something big comes along.

                                     MILES
                         Uh-huh.

                                     JACK
                         We're not getting any younger, right? 
                         And my career, well, it's gotten 
                         pretty, you know, frustrating. Even 
                         with my new manager. Maybe it's time 
                         to settle down.

                                     MILES
                         If that's what feels right.

                                     JACK
                              (convincing himself)
                         It does. Feels right.

                                     MILES
                         Then it's a good thing.

                                     JACK
                              (nodding, feeling 
                              better)
                         Yeah. It's good. Feels good.

               Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking 
               lot. The camera PANS to reveal --

               THE HITCHING POST, a local institution.

               INT. HITCHING POST BAR - DUSK

               Miles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots 
               Miles and extends a welcoming hand.

                                     GARY
                         Hey, Miles. Long time no see.

                                     MILES
                         Gary.

                                     GARY
                         When's that novel of yours coming 
                         out?  We  all want to read it.

                                     MILES
                         Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy 
                         Jack. He's getting married next week.

                                     GARY
                              (shaking Jack's hand)
                         My condolences.

                                     MILES
                         What are you pouring tonight?

                                     GARY
                         Lot of good stuff.
                              (looking at a row of 
                              bottles)
                         Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?

                                     MILES
                         Absolutement.
                              (to Jack)
                         They have their own label that's 
                         just outstanding.

               Gary pours Jack and Miles a generous sample and the two men 
               swirl, sniff and taste. Jack is beginning to get the hang of 
               things.

                                     GARY
                         What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         Tight as a nun's asshole but qood 
                         concentration. Nice fruit.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. Tight.

                                     MILES
                              (to Gary)
                         Pour us a couple.

               Gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle. Jack raises 
               his glass to toast.

                                     JACK
                         Here's to my last week of freedom.

                                     MILES
                         It's going to be great. Here's to 
                         us.

               They clink their glasses and take a drink. We linger on them 
               as Miles retreats inward and a restless Jack scans the room.

               INT. HITCHING POST DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Jack and Miles review their menus. Jack looks up and spots a 
               PRETTY WAITRESS placing an order at the bar.

                                     JACK
                         Miles. Check it out.

               Miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, yeah. That's Maya.

                                     JACK
                         You know her?

                                     MILES
                         Sure I know Maya.

                                     JACK
                         You know that chick?

                                     MILES
                         Jack, this is where I eat when I 
                         come up here. It's practically my 
                         office. And sometimes I have a drink 
                         with the employees. Maya's great. 
                         She's worked here about a year, maybe 
                         a year and a half.

                                     JACK
                         She is very hot.

                                     MILES
                         And very nice. And very married. 
                         Check out the rock.

               Jack leans forward and squints.

                                     JACK
                         Doesn't mean shit. When Christine 
                         was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she 
                         wore a big engagement ring to keep 
                         guys from hitting on her. Think it 
                         worked? Fuck no. How do you think I 
                         met her?

                                     MILES
                         This gal's married to I think a 
                         Philosophy professor at UC Santa 
                         Barbara.

                                     JACK
                         So what's a professor's wife doing 
                         waitressing? Obviously that's over.

                                     MILES
                         You don't know anything about this 
                         woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, 
                         okay?
                              (focusing on the menu)
                         The duck is excellent and pairs nicely 
                         with the Highliner Pinot.

               Just then Maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way 
               to another table.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey, Miles. Good to see you.

                                     MILES
                         Maya, how are you?

                                     MAYA
                         I'm doing good, good. You look great. 
                         Did you lose some weight?

                                     MILES
                         Oh, no, actually. Busy night.

                                     MAYA
                         Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been 
                         out tasting today?

                                     MILES
                         You know it. This is my friend Jack. 
                         Jack, Maya.

                                     JACK
                              (big smile)
                         Hiya.

                                     MAYA
                              (smiling back)
                         Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. 
                         Bye, Miles.

               She goes.

                                     JACK
                         Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes 
                         you. What else do you know about 
                         her?

                                     MILES
                         Well, she does know a lot about wine.

                                     JACK
                         Ooooooohh. Now we're getting 
                         somewhere.

                                     MILES
                         And she likes Pinot.

                                     JACK
                         Perfect.

                                     MILES
                         Jack, she's a fucking waitress in 
                         Buellton. How would that ever work?

                                     JACK
                         Why do you always focus on the 
                         negative? Didn't you see how friendly 
                         she was to you?

                                     MILES
                         She works for tips!

                                     JACK
                         You're blind, dude. Blind.

               Miles focuses again on the menu.

                                     MILES
                         I also recommend the ostrich. Very 
                         lean. Locally raised.

               INT. HITCHING POST BAR - NIGHT

               TWO BURGUNDY GLASSES --

               are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of 
               Hitching Post Pinot Noir.

               Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink.

               MILES

               Looks like he's thinking about something. Then --

                                     MILES
                         I hate Tony Levin.

               Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then --

               MAYA

               Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She 
               has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys, 
               lovely but tired.

                                     MAYA
                              (to Gary)
                         Highliner, please.

                                     JACK
                         That's on us.

               Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from 
               their bottle.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey, guys.

               Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and 
               lights it while Gary pours her a glass.

                                     MILES
                         You want to join us?

                                     MAYA
                              (polite)
                         Sure.

               In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and 
               comes down the bar.

                                     MAYA
                         So how's that book of yours going, 
                         Miles? I think you were almost done 
                         with it last time we talked.

                                     MILES
                         I finished it.

                                     MAYA
                         Good for you.

                                     JACK
                         It's getting published. That's what 
                         we're up here celebrating.

               Miles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a "don't-fuck- 
               it-up-brother" glower.

                                     MAYA
                         That's fantastic. Congratulations.

               She offers her glass, and all clink.

                                     MAYA
                              (to Jack)
                         Are you a writer too?

                                     JACK
                         No, I'm an actor.

                                     MAYA
                         Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?

                                     JACK
                         A lot of TV. I was a regular on a 
                         couple of series. And lately I've 
                         been doing a lot of commercials. 
                         National mostly.

                                     MAYA
                         Anything I'd know?

                                     JACK
                         Maybe. Recognize this?

               Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER 
               VOICE.

                                     JACK
                         "Now with low, low 5.8% APR 
                         financing."

               Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile.

                                     MAYA
                         That's hilarious. You sound just 
                         like one of those guys.

                                     JACK
                         I am one of those guys.

                                     MAYA
                         You are not.

                                     MILES
                         He is.

               Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits.

                                     JACK
                              (very fast)

                         this product. Side effects may include 
                         oily discharge, dizziness, hives,

                         diabetes or a history of kidney 
                         trouble... you're fucked!

               This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in. 
               Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters 
               a tight courtesy smile.

                                     MAYA
                              (winding down)
                         Oh. I needed that. Thank you.

               They all take a drink of wine.

                                     MAYA
                         So what are you guys up to tonight?

               Before Jack has a chance to speak --

                                     MILES
                         We're pretty wiped. Probably go back 
                         to the hotel and crash.

               This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent 
               availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a 
                         long drive up here. Where're you 
                         staying?

                                     MILES
                         The Windmill.

                                     JACK
                         Windmill.

               Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and 
               picks up her jean jacket and purse.

                                     MAYA
                         Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.

                                     MILES
                         See you.

               As she leaves --

                                     JACK
                         We'll catch up with you later, okay?

               But she's gone. Jack gives Miles a slow burn look.

                                     JACK
                         We'll probably go back to the hotel 
                         and crash?

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as CARS WHIZ BY.

                                     JACK
                         The girl is looking to party, and 
                         you tell her we're going to go back 
                         to our motel room and crash? Jesus, 
                         Miles!

                                     MILES
                         Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

                                     JACK
                         The chick digs you. She lit up like 
                         a pinball machine when she heard 
                         your novel was getting published.

                                     MILES
                         Now I've got another lie to live 
                         down. Thanks, Jack.

                                     JACK
                         I'm trying to get you some action, 
                         but you've got to help me out just a 
                         little bit.

                                     MILES
                         Didn't seem to me like that's what 
                         was going on. You were all over her.

                                     JACK
                         Somebody had to do the talking. And 
                         by the way, I was right. She's not 
                         married.

                                     MILES
                         How do you know?

                                     JACK
                         No rock. When she came to the bar, 
                         sans rock.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               The screen is absolutely BLACK.

                                     JACK
                         Single. Waitress. Getting off work. 
                         Looking for love. A little slap and 
                         tickle.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up.

                                     JACK
                         She probably went home, lit some 
                         candles, put on some relaxing music, 
                         took a nice hot bath, and laid down 
                         on her bed with her favorite vibrator.

               Jack begins to make a soft BUZZING noise, growing gradually 
               louder and more rhythmic.

                                     MILES
                         Have you no shame?

                                     JACK
                         Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Fuck you.

               There's now a rustling noise and footsteps. Then a LIGHT is 
               flipped on in the BATHROOM.

               Miles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible 
               is at the bottom of the bathroom door.

               Miles PEES -- a series of semi-forced SHORT SQUIRTS. Then a 
               FLUSH as a door opens and the light goes off. Jack starts 
               BUZZING again.

                                     MILES
                         Shut the fuck up!

               Jack stops and Miles climbs into bed. Silence. Then --

                                     JACK
                         You need to get your prostate checked.

               UNDER BLACK --

                                          MONDAY

               EXT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY

               Establishing.

               INT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY

               Miles and Jack are glancing at the menus. For some reason 
               Jack is humorless and grumpy.

                                     MILES
                         So what're we going to have? Pigs in 
                         a blanket? The "rancher's special 
                         breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease 
                         and fat with a side of lard?

                                     JACK
                              (not amused)
                         So what's the plan today?

                                     MILES
                         We head north, begin the grape tour 
                         up there, make our way south so the 
                         more we drink the closer we get to 
                         the motel.

               Jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple.

                                     MILES
                         What's your problem?

               Jack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to 
               get into it.

                                     MILES
                         What is it?

               Jack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words. 
               Then the dam bursts.

                                     JACK
                         I am going to get my nut on this 
                         trip, Miles. And you are not going 
                         to fuck it up for me with all your 
                         depression and anxiety and neg-head 
                         downer shit.

                                     MILES
                         Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.

                                     JACK
                         Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do 
                         not fuck with me. I am going to get 
                         laid before I settle down on Saturday. 
                         Do you read me?

                                     MILES
                         Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. 
                         It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in 
                         the way and dragging you down. Maybe 
                         you'd have a better time on your 
                         own. You take the car. I'll catch 
                         the train back.

                                     JACK
                         No, see, I want both of us to get 
                         crazy. We should both be cutting 
                         loose. I mean, this is our last 
                         chance. This is our week! It should 
                         be something we share.

               The older WAITRESS comes over.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I take your order?

                                     JACK
                         But I am warning you.

                         Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye 
                         toast. Dry.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Okay. And you?

                              (glaring at Miles)
                         Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.

               EXT. LOVELY HIGHWAY - DAY

               The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through 
               large open vineyards.

               Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the 
               distance.

               INT. FOXEN WINERY - DAY

               Miles has just downed a taste of red wine.

                                     MILES
                         How much skin and stem contact?

                                     POURER
                         About four weeks.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. That explains all the tannins. 
                         And how long in oak?

                                     POURER
                         About a year.

                         French or American?

                                     POURER
                         Both.

                                     MILES
                         Good stuff.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, oak. That's a good wood.

               Just as the pourer turns away toward other TASTERS, Jack 
               GRABS the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass. 
               They slam back their drinks like tequila.

               EXT. LOVELY AREA ON A HILL - DAY

               Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before 
               them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards.

                                     MILES
                         Nice, huh?

                                     JACK
                         Beautiful.

                                     MILES
                         Victoria and I used to like this 
                         view.
                              (lost in nostalgia)
                         Once we had a picnic here and drank 
                         a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon 
                         and artichokes, but we didn't care.

                                     JACK
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         She has the best palate of any woman 
                         I've ever known. She could even 
                         differentiate Italian wines.

                                     JACK
                         Miles, I gotta tell you something. 
                         Victoria's coming to the wedding.

                                     MILES
                         I know. You told me. I'm okay with 
                         it.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, but that's not the whole story. 
                         She got remarried.

                                     MILES
                         She what?
                              (long pause)
                         When?

                                     JACK
                         About a month ago. Six weeks.

                                     MILES
                         To that guy? That guy with the 
                         restaurant...

               Jack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long 
               breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes 
               the door.

                                     JACK
                         Miles... MILES...

               Miles continues to stare straight ahead.

                                     JACK
                              (exploding)
                         Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!

                                     MILES
                         I want to go home now.

                                     JACK
                         You've been divorced for two years 
                         already. People move on. She has! 
                         It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes 
                         you feel special or something.

                                     MILES
                         Is she bringing him to the wedding?

                                     JACK
                         What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         You drop this bombshell on me. Why 
                         didn't you tell me before?

                                     JACK
                         Because I knew you'd freak out and 
                         probably get so depressed you wouldn't 
                         even come on this trip. But then I 
                         figured here would be the best place 
                         to tell you. We're here to forget 
                         about all that shit. We're here to 
                         party!

                                     MILES
                              (undeterred)
                         I'm going to be a fucking pariah. 
                         Everyone's just going to be holding 
                         their breath to see if I'm going to 
                         get drunk and make a scene. Plus 
                         Tony fucking Levin?

                                     JACK
                         No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to 
                         Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's 
                         cool.

                                     MILES
                              (horrified)
                         You've all been talking about it? 
                         Behind my back? Talking about it?

               Miles turns and locates an open BOTTLE of wine in the back 
               seat. He uncorks it and begins to swig.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!

               Jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from Miles, but 
               Miles bolts out of the car.

               A VERY WIDE SHOT --

               Pursued by Jack, Miles dashes down the hill, all the while 
               taking huge swigs from the bottle.

               OMIT.

               EXT. LOVELY VINEYARD - CONTINUOUS

               Miles slows to walk between rows of GRAPEVINES. He polishes 
               off the bottle and tosses it. A painting Jack catches up 
               with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor.

               Miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry. Then 
               he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight.

               Jack looks around impatiently for a moment. Then he squats 
               down so he can see Miles underneath the vines.

                                     JACK
                         Miles?

               Miles ignores Jack and focuses on the beautiful RIPE GRAPES 
               that surround him. They seem to distract him from his pain.

                                     JACK
                         You going to be okay?

               Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive NO. Jack 
               can't help but LAUGH.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

               The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot, 
               Jack at the wheel.

               INT. KALYRA TASTING ROOM - DAY

               The pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away 
               from a BORING COUPLE down the bar. This is STEPHANIE.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Hey, guys. How's it going?

                                     JACK
                         Excellent. My friend and I are up 
                         here doing the wine tour, and he 
                         tells me that you folks make one 
                         hell of a Syrah.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         That's what people say.

                                     MILES
                              (slurring slightly)
                         You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he 
                         didn't know Pinot Noir from film 
                         noir.

                                     JACK
                         I'm a quick learner.

               Stephanie laughs. She apparently likes big good-natured lunks 
               like Jack.

                                     MILES
                         I'm trying to teach my friend here 
                         some basics about wine over the next 
                         few days before he goes off and --

               WHOOMP! Under the bar Jack stomps on Miles's foot. Miles 
               winces.

               Stephanie slides TWO GLASSES in front of them.

                                     JACK
                         That's right -- I'm here to learn. I 
                         never had that much interest in wine 
                         before, but this trip has been very 
                         enlightening. Always like wine, of 
                         course, but I don't know. More of a 
                         beer man, really. Microbreweries.

               She THUMPS the cork off a bottle of Chardonnay.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Well, no better way to learn than 
                         tasting.

               She pours almost flirtatious amounts.

                                     JACK
                         Now there's a girl who knows how to 
                         pour. What's your name?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Stephanie.

                                     JACK
                         Nice.

               Jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier. 
               They look, they smell, they taste.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         So what do you think?

                                     MILES
                         Quaffable but far from transcendent.

                                     JACK
                         I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.

               Stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours. Jack's eyes 
               never leave her.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Cabernet Franc.
                              (as they taste)
                         This is only the fifth year we've 
                         made this varietal. Very few wineries 
                         around here do a straight Cabernet 
                         Franc. It's from our vineyard up in 
                         Santa Maria. And it was a Silver 
                         Medal winner at Paso Robles last 
                         year.

                                     MILES
                         Well, I've come to never expect 
                         greatness from a Cab Franc, and this 
                         one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, 
                         overripe --

                                     JACK
                              (ignoring him)
                         Tastes good to me. You live around 
                         here, Stephanie?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         In Santa Ynez.
                              (low, to Miles)
                         And I agree with you about Cab Franc.

                                     JACK
                         Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. 
                         Windmill Inn.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Oh yeah.

                                     JACK
                         You know a gal named Maya? Works at 
                         the Hitching Post?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Sure I know Maya. Real well.

                                     JACK
                         No shit. We just had a drink with 
                         her last night. Miles knows her.

                                     MILES
                         Could we move on to the Syrah, please?

               As she turns to reach for the right bottle, Jack winks at 
               Miles. Miles shakes his head.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         This is our Estate Syrah...

               She pours each of them a full HALF GLASS.

                                     JACK
                         You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         I know. I might need to be spanked.

               She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has 
               been monopolized.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Excuse me.

               As she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth 
               wide open.

                                     JACK
                         A bad girl, Miles. She might need to 
                         be spanked.

                                     MILES
                         Do you know how often these pourers 
                         get hit on?

               They glance down the bar at Stepanie. She smiles back.

               EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

               Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He 
               looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room 
               with TWO CASES OF WINE.

                                     JACK
                         Get the trunk.

                                     MILES
                         You have the keys.

               Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building.

                                     JACK
                         We're on.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         She called Maya, who's not working 
                         tonight, so we're all going out.

                                     MILES
                         With Maya?

                                     JACK
                         Been divorced for a year now, bud.

               Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car.

                                     JACK
                         Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it 
                         all going on.

                                     MILES
                         Well, she is cute.

                                     JACK
                         Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And 
                         you almost tell her I'm getting 
                         married. What's the matter with you?
                              (drumming on the 
                              steering wheel)
                         Gotta love it. Gotta love it.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               THE TV --

               GOLF on ESPN.

               MILES AND JACK

               sit transfixed, each on his own bed. The curtains are drawn. 
               Then out of nowhere --

                                     JACK
                              (mocking)
                         You know how often these pourers get 
                         hit on?
                              (getting up)
                         I'm going for a swim. Get the blood 
                         flowing. Want to come?

                                     MILES
                         Nah. I want to watch this.

               CLOSE ON THE TV --

               A guy gets ready to putt. The announcer whispers what an 
               important moment this is. The guy misses.

               FADE TO BLACK.

               UNDER BLACK --

               The sound of an AEROSOL CAN.

                                     JACK
                         Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.

               WE OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE --

               Jack spraying his feet with some Dr. Scholl's product.

               WIDE --

               Miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his 
               suitcase.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi --
                         goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts 
                         up here. Whole place is wide open. 
                         Assylvania.

               Jack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch.

                                     MILES
                         So what should I wear?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Casual but nice. They 
                         think you're a writer.

               As Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open 
               his cellphone and speed-dials.

                                     JACK
                         Don't you have any other shoes?

               Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor.

                                     JACK
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking 
                         in. Not much. We're about to go out 
                         for dinner, probably be out pretty 
                         late, so I thought I'd say goodnight 
                         now. I know, I love you too. I miss 
                         you.

               EXT. LOS OLIVOS - NIGHT

               The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk 
               in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet 
               restaurants.

                                     JACK
                         Please just try to be your normal 
                         humorous self, okay? Like who you 
                         were before the tailspin. Do you 
                         remember that guy? People love that 
                         guy. And don't forget -- your novel 
                         is coming out in the fall.

                                     MILES
                         Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it 
                         called?

                                     JACK
                         Do not sabotage me. If you want to 
                         be a lightweight, that's your call. 
                         But do not sabotage me.

                                     MILES
                         Aye-aye, captain.

                                     JACK
                         And if they want to drink Merlot, 
                         we're drinking Merlot.

                                     MILES
                              (dead serious)
                         If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. 
                         I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!

                                     JACK
                         Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No 
                         Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?

               Miles takes a SMALL BOTTLE from his pocket and rattles it.

                                     JACK
                         And don't drink too much. I don't 
                         want you going to the dark side or 
                         passing out. Do you hear me? No going 
                         to the dark side.

                                     MILES
                         Okay! Fuck!

               Miles quickly POPS A XANAX. Jack gives him a final look in 
               the eye.

                                     JACK
                         We're going in.

               INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - NIGHT

               The boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange 
               words with the HOSTESS. Then they notice --

               MAYA AND STEPHANIE

               at a booth waving at them. They look great.

               MILES AND JACK

               make their way to the table, Jack wearing a broad, confident 
               SMILE.

               AT THE TABLE --

               Jack plops down next to Stephanie, while Miles politely eases 
               in on Maya's side. Jack touches a hand to Stephanie's bare 
               neck and massages it meaningfully.

                                     JACK
                         How you doin' tonight, beautiful?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Good. How're you?

                                     JACK
                         Great. You look great.
                              (including Maya)
                         You both do.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Not so bad yourself.

               Meanwhile Miles looks over at Maya and purses his lips in an 
               affable if uncomfortable smile. Then --

                                     MILES
                         What are you drinking?

                                     MAYA
                         A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.

                                     MILES
                         Oh yeah? How is it?

                                     MAYA
                              (sliding the glass)
                         Try it.

               As Miles swirls the wine and takes a sip, he begins to relax.

                                     MILES
                         Nice. Very nice.

                                     MAYA
                         Twelve months in oak.

                                     MILES
                         On a Sauvignon Blanc?

                                     MAYA
                         I know the winemaker. She comes in 
                         the restaurant all the time.

                                     MILES
                         This is good. Little hints of clove.

                                     MAYA
                         I know. I love that.

               LATER --

               A WAITER finishes listing off the specials.

                                     WAITER
                         ...medallions of pork with a dusting 
                         of black truffles served with a root 
                         vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped 
                         potatoes. And finally a Copper River 
                         salmon grilled on an alder wood plank. 
                         And that comes with roasted new 
                         potatoes and steamed watercress.

               The four diners exchange looks of delight.

                                     WAITER
                         And who gets the wine list?

               Miles raises his hand and takes the leather-bound book.

                                     MAYA
                              (teasing)
                         I guess Miles wants it.

               Jack glares at Miles, who immediately gets the hint.

                                     MILES
                         Nope. You ladies choose.

               Jack smiles and nods his approval. Jack takes the book out 
               of Miles's hands and offers it to the girls.

                                     MAYA
                         You choose, Stephanie.

                                     STEPHANIE
                              (opening it)
                         So what does everyone feel like?

                                     JACK
                         Whatever you girls want. It's on us 
                         tonight. Sky's the limit.

                                     MAYA
                         No, we're paying for the wine.

                                     JACK
                         I don't think so. We're celebrating 
                         Miles's book deal.

                                     MAYA
                         Well, in that case...

               Miles draws a long breath.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         What's everyone ordering? Then we 
                         can sort out the wine.

                                     MILES
                         Exactement!

               Jack shoots Miles a look.

                                     MAYA
                         I'm having the salmon.

                                     MILES
                         That's what I'm having.

                                     STEPHANIE
                              (still scanning the 
                              wines)
                         I'm thinking about the duck breast.

                                     JACK
                              (slapping his menu 
                              shut)
                         Me too.

                                     MAYA
                         Well, that narrows things down.

               Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over 
               the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.

               Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE.

                                     JACK
                         Pinot!

               Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls 
               to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!

               DINNER is improvised, but includes:

               -- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.

               -- The SALADS.

               -- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her 
               finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.

               -- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND 
               WINE.

               -- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles.

               -- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier.

               -- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.

               -- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested 
               and available -- it's too much for him.

               -- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, 
               the cutting choppier.

               -- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya 
               and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his 
               jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.

               -- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm 
               shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down."

               CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble 
               of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much 
               that he spaces out, descending into --

               INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS

               Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, 
               the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded 
               boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over 
               to the dark side.

               INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN

               Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in 
               their own little world -- Jack explaining something to 
               Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.

               -- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused 
               expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.

               -- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.

               -- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short 
               but sensual kiss.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. 
               He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person 
               perspectives.

               AT THE BATHROOMS --

               He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the 
               XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing 
               it dry.

               He notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a 
               moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.

               CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD --

               as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely 
               out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone 
               RINGING and a PICKUP.

               THE RECEIVER --

               As Miles presses it desperately to his head.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Hello?

                                     MILES
                         Victoria.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles?

               Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone.

                                     MILES
                         Victoria! How the hell are you?

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Fine. What's, uh, what's on your 
                         mind?

                                     MILES
                         Heard you got remarried! 
                         Congratulations. Didn't think you 
                         had the stomach for another go-round.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Oh, Miles. You're drunk.

                                     MILES
                         Just some local Pinot, you know, 
                         then a little Burgundy. That old 
                         Cotes de Beaune!

               Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Where are you?

                                     MILES
                         A little place in Los Olivos. New 
                         owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent 
                         food too -- you should try it. Thought 
                         of you at the Hitching Post last 
                         night.

               Silence.

                                     MILES (CONT' D)
                         Hello?

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles, don't call me when you're 
                         drunk.

                                     MILES
                         I just wanted you to know I've decided 
                         not to go to the wedding, so in case 
                         you were dreading some uncomfortable, 
                         you know, run-in or something, well, 
                         worry no more. You won't see me there. 
                         My wedding gift to you and what's-
                         his-name. What is his name?

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                              (silence, then --)
                         Ken.

                                     MILES
                         Ken.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles, I don't care if you come to 
                         the wedding or not.

                                     MILES
                         Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you 
                         guys have fun.

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm going to hang up now, Miles.

                                     MILES
                              (rushing to keep her 
                              on)
                         You see, Vicki, I just heard about 
                         this today, you getting married that 
                         is, and I was kind of taken aback. 
                         Kind of hard to believe.

               Silence.

                                     MILES
                         I guess I just thought there was 
                         still some hope for us somewhere 
                         down the road and I just, I just --

                                     VICTORIA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles, maybe it is better if you 
                         don't come to the wedding.

               Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth.

                                     MILES
                         Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the 
                         boss.

               He HANGS UP as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call 
               and heads back to the table.

               EXT. DEEP CANYON - DAY

               For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE 
               extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.

               INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN

               Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and SLIPS ONTO THE 
               FLOOR.

               Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls 
               burst into hysterical LAUGHTER. Jack then laughs too, perhaps 
               OVER-LAUGHING.

                                     JACK
                         Easy, boy. Easy.

               Maya helps him back into the booth.

                                     MAYA
                         Are you all right?

                                     MILES
                         Fine. Just slipped.
                              (picking up his glass)
                         This is my blood.

               Miles drinks. Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who 
               nods in return.

                                     STEPHANIE
                              (to the guys)
                         Excuse us.

                                     MAYA
                         Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         That's okay.

               Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass. Then --

                                     JACK
                         What the fuck, man? What is up?

               Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away.

                                     JACK
                         Pull yourself together, man.

                                     MILES
                         I'm fine!

               But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a WATER 
               GLASS. Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth.

                                     JACK
                         Where were you?

                                     MILES
                         Bathroom.

                                     JACK
                         Did you drink and dial?

               Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame.

                                     JACK
                         Why do you always do this? Victoria's 
                         gone, man. Gone. Poof.

               Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing 
               out an exhale through his nose.

                                     JACK
                         Stop it. You are blowing a great 
                         opportunity here, Miles. Fucking 
                         Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. 
                         She's funny. She knows wine. What is 
                         this morose come-down bullshit? These 
                         girls want to party. And what was 
                         that fucking ten-minute lecture on, 
                         what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come 
                         on!

                                     MILES
                         Let's just say I'm uncomfortable 
                         with the whole scenario.

                                     JACK
                         Oh Jesus, Miles.

               Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand. Jack lets 
               it pass.

                                     JACK
                         And don't forget all the bad times 
                         you had with Victoria. How small she 
                         make you feel. That's why you had 
                         the affair in the first place.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up. Shut your face.

                                     JACK
                         Don't you see how Maya's looking at 
                         you? You got her on the hook. Reel 
                         her in! Come on, let's rachet this 
                         up a notch. You know how to to do 
                         it. Here.
                              (passing a glass)
                         Drink some agua.

               Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.

               The girls now return to the table. The guys slide over.

                                     MILES
                              (trying to appear 
                              sober)
                         Should we get dessert?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         We were thinking. Why don't we go 
                         back to my place? I've got wine, 
                         some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

               Jack raises both arms like a football referee.

                                     JACK
                         Excellent idea. Waiter!

               INT. SAAB - NIGHT

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

               Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed 
               into the woods.

               INSIDE --

               Jack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense 
               of A HAND-DRAWN MAP.

                                     JACK
                              (grabbing the map)
                         Let me see that.

               EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop 
               outside this wood-framed cottage.

               Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the 
               way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string 
               of FOUR CONDOMS.

                                     JACK
                              (tearing)
                         Here. One for you, three for me.

               Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch 
               steps --

                                     MILES
                         You sure you want to do this?

               Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile 
               incredulity.

               THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR 
               before going in.

               INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The boys enter this modest living room furnished with 
               weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and 
               there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the 
               walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing.

                                     JACK
                         We're here!

               Stephanie sails in.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         What happened to you guys?

                                     JACK
                         Couple of wrong turns.
                              (pointing a thumb at 
                              Miles)
                         Thanks to Magellan, here.

               After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss.

                                     JACK
                         Hi.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Hi.
                              (to Miles)
                         Maya's in the kitchen.

               Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward --

               EXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little 
               temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.

                                     MILES
                         Hi.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey.

                                     MILES
                         She got anything good?

                                     MAYA
                         Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots 
                         and Syrahs.
                              (calling out)
                         Hey, Steph? You sure we can open 
                         anything? Anything we want?

                                     STEPHANIE (V.O.)
                         Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!

                                     MILES
                         She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I 
                         have completely underestimated 
                         Stephanie.

                                     MAYA
                         Who do you think you're dealing with 
                         here?

               Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.

                                     MAYA
                         How about this?

               Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between 
               Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it 
               back in.

                                     MAYA
                         Nope. I don't think we know each 
                         other well enough.
                              (picking out another 
                              bottle)
                         I'd say this guy's more our speed.

               They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and, 
               raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it.

                                     MAYA
                         So what gems do you have in your 
                         collection?

                                     MILES
                         Not much of a collection really. I 
                         haven't had the wallet for that, so 
                         I sort of live bottle to bottle. But 
                         I've got a couple things I'm saving. 
                         I guess the star would be a 1961 
                         Cheval Blanc.

                                     MAYA
                         You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's 
                         just sitting there? Go get it.
                              (pushing him, playfully 
                              stern)
                         Right now. Hurry up...

               Miles laughs, fights back a bit.

                                     MAYA
                         Seriously, the '61s are peaking, 
                         aren't they? At least that's what 
                         I've read.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I know.

                                     MAYA
                         It might be too late already. What 
                         are you waiting for?

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. Special occasion. With 
                         the right person. It was supposed to 
                         be for my tenth wedding anniversary.

               Understanding, Maya considers her response.

                                     MAYA
                         The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, 
                         that's the special occasion.

                                     MILES
                         How long have you been into wine?

                                     MAYA
                         I started to get serious about seven 
                         years ago.

                                     MILES
                         What was the bottle that did it?

                                     MAYA
                         Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

               Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. Maya pours, and they 
               clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.

                                     MILES
                         Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but 
                         this is tasty. Really good. How about 
                         you?

                                     MAYA
                              (tastes again)
                         I think they overdid it a bit. Too 
                         much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.

                                     MILES
                              (tasting again, 
                              impressed)
                         Yeah, I'd say you're right on the 
                         money.

               Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a 
               PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.

                                     MILES
                         Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is 
                         cute.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.

                                     MILES
                         Is she sleeping or...?

                                     MAYA
                         She's with her grandmother. She's 
                         with Steph's mom. She spends a lot 
                         of time over there. Steph's... well, 
                         she's Stephanie.  

               Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         "And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."

               ...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.

                                     MAYA
                         You got kids?

                                     MILES
                         Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. 
                         That was the one unpolluted part of 
                         my divorce -- no kids.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, same here.

               Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, 
               thinking about something else.

                                     MAYA
                         Let's go in there.

               Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --

               INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Jack and Stephanie are gone. From a distant bedroom comes 
               more laughter.

                                     MAYA
                         Looks like our friends are hitting 
                         it off.

               While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the 
               couch. Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a 
               glimpse of the small of HER BACK.

               She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch. They look at 
               each other without speaking. Just what is the vibe here?

                                     MAYA
                         It's kind of weird sitting here with 
                         you in Stephanie's house. All those 
                         times you came into the restaurant. 
                         It's like you're a real person now. 
                         Almost.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. 
                         Out of context.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah, weird. But great.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah. Definitely.

               An awkward silence, broken by Maya.

                                     MAYA
                         So what's your novel about?

                                     MILES
                         Well, it's a little difficult to 
                         summarize. It begins as a first-person 
                         account of a guy taking care of his 
                         father after a stroke. Kind of based 
                         on personal experience, but only 
                         loosely.

                                     MAYA
                         What's the title?

                                     MILES
                         "The Day After Yesterday."

                                     MAYA
                         Oh. You mean... today?

                                     MILES
                         Um... yeah but it's more...

                                     MAYA
                         So is it kind of about death and 
                         mortality, or...?

                                     MILES
                         Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It 
                         shifts around a lot. Like you also 
                         start to see everything from the 
                         point of view of the father. And 
                         some other stuff happens, some 
                         parallel narrative, and then it 
                         evolves -- or devolves -- into a 
                         kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- 
                         you know, with no real resolution.

                                     MAYA
                         Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing 
                         you're getting it published. Really. 
                         I know how hard it is. Just to write 
                         it even.

                                     MILES
                              (squeezing it out)
                         Yeah. Thanks.

                                     MAYA
                         Like me, I have this stupid paper 
                         due on Friday, and as usual I'm 
                         freaked out about it. Just like in 
                         high school. It never changes.

                                     MILES
                         A paper?

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah. I'm working on a masters in 
                         horticulture. Chipping away at it.

                                     MILES
                         Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know 
                         there was a college here.

                                     MAYA
                         I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a 
                         week.

                                     MILES
                         So... you want to work for a winery 
                         or something someday?

                                     MAYA
                         Well...

                                     MILES
                         I do have a copy of the manuscript 
                         in the car. It's not fully proofed, 
                         but if you're okay with a few typos...

                                     MAYA
                         Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of 
                         typos.
                              (sipping the wine)
                         Wow, this is really starting to open 
                         up. What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         My palate's kind of shot, but from 
                         what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty 
                         damn good.

                                     MAYA
                         Can I ask you a personal question?

                                     MILES
                              (bracing himself)
                         Sure.

                                     MAYA
                         Why are you so into Pinot? It's like 
                         a thing with you.

               Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. 
               He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. It's a hard grape to 
                         grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, 
                         temperamental, ripens early. It's 
                         not a survivor like Cabernet that 
                         can grow anywhere and thrive even 
                         when neglected. Pinot needs constant 
                         care and attention and in fact can 
                         only grow in specific little tucked-
                         away corners of the world. And only 
                         the most patient and nurturing growers 
                         can do it really, can tap into Pinot's 
                         most fragile, delicate qualities. 
                         Only when someone has taken the time 
                         to truly understand its potential 
                         can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest 
                         expression. And when that happens, 
                         its flavors are the most haunting 
                         and brilliant and subtle and thrilling 
                         and ancient on the planet.

               Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.

                                     MILES
                         I mean, Cabernets can be powerful 
                         and exalting, but they seem prosaic 
                         to me for some reason. By comparison. 
                         How about you?

                                     MAYA
                         What about me?

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. Why are you into wine?

                                     MAYA
                         I suppose I got really into wine 
                         originally through my ex-husband. He 
                         had a big, kind of show-off cellar. 
                         But then I found out that I have a 
                         really sharp palate, and the more I 
                         drank, the more I liked what it made 
                         me think about.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah? Like what?

                                     MAYA
                         Like what a fraud he was.

               Miles laughs.

                                     MAYA
                         No, but I do like to think about the 
                         life of wine, how it's a living thing. 
                         I like to think about what was going 
                         on the year the grapes were growing, 
                         how the sun was shining that summer 
                         or if it rained... what the weather 
                         was like. I think about all those 
                         people who tended and picked the 
                         grapes, and if it's an old wine, how 
                         many of them must be dead by now. I 
                         love how wine continues to evolve, 
                         how every time I open a bottle it's 
                         going to taste different than if I 
                         had opened it on any other day. 
                         Because a bottle of wine is actually 
                         alive -- it's constantly evolving 
                         and gaining complexity. That is, 
                         until it peaks -- like your '61 -- 
                         and begins its steady, inevitable 
                         decline. And it tastes so fucking 
                         good.

               Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells 
               us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs 
               another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches 
               out and places one hand atop his.

                                     MILES
                              (pointing)
                         Bathroom over there?

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah.

               Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American 
               Spirit out of her purse.

               INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

               The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and 
               the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S 
               BATH TOYS.

               Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, 
               trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and 
               without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks. 
               Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.

                                     MILES
                         You are such a loser. Come on!

               INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's 
               not there.

               Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through 
               the door into --

               INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.

                                     MAYA
                         I was just getting some water. You 
                         want some water?

               Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. 
               Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and 
               looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is 
               long gone.

               He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels 
               strained and awkward.

               After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.

                                     MAYA
                         Nice.

               But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading 
               back into the living room.

                                     MAYA (O.S.)
                         I should probably get going.

               Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.

               INT. SAAB - NIGHT

               Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads 
               him through this very rural road.

               EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts 
               it in PARK and gets out.

               AT THE SAAB --

               Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.

                                     MAYA
                         You know how to get back to the 
                         Windmill, right?

                                     MILES
                         Got it.

                                     MAYA
                         I had a good time tonight, Miles. I 
                         really did.

                                     MILES
                         Good. So did I.

                                     MAYA
                         Okay. See you around.

                                     MILES
                         Um... did you still want to read my 
                         novel?

                                     MAYA
                         Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

               Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX, 
               and hands it to Maya.

                                     MAYA
                         Wow. Great.

               He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it 
               over as well.

                                     MILES
                         Hope you like it. Feel free to stop 
                         reading at any time. I'll take no 
                         offense.

                                     MAYA
                         Goodnight, Miles.

               She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.

               After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction 
               while Miles heads in the opposite.

               OMIT.

               UNDER BLACK --

                                         TUESDAY

               Jack's cellphone RINGS.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               NOW EARLY MORNING --

               Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room.

               Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks 
               at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number. He 
               briefly considers his options -- answer it? shut it off? --
               before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.

               The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE 
               RINGS. An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.

               As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching 
               head, we again --

               FADE TO BLACK.

               LATER --

               VROOM! Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop. Then 
               over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct 
               VOICES and LAUGHTER.

               Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.

               FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself 
               in, flushed and exuberant.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be-
                         lieve-able!

               He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without 
               closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.

                                     JACK
                         Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty 
                         nasty nasty.

                                     MILES
                         Well, I'm glad you got it out of 
                         your system. Congratulations. Mission 
                         accomplished.

               A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has 
               left open. Down in the parking lot he sees --

               STEPHANIE

               atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed 
               suede jacket. She gives him a big friendly wave.

               MILES

               returns the wave and goes back inside.

                                     MILES
                         You didn't invite Stephanie to come 
                         with us, did you?

               With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his 
               bag.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's 
                         off today, so she and I are going on 
                         a hike.

                                     MILES
                         We were supposed to play golf.

                                     JACK
                         You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're 
                         brand new -- gift from Christine's 
                         dad.
                              (slapping some cash 
                              on the dresser)
                         It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, 
                         Stephanie and me were thinking we'd 
                         all go to the Hitching Post tonight 
                         and sit at one of Maya's tables, and 
                         she'll bring us some great wines and 
                         then we can all --

                                     MILES
                              (sitting down)
                         Count me out.

                                     JACK
                         Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last 
                         night, huh? That's a shocker. You 
                         mean getting drunk and calling 
                         Victoria didn't put you in the mood? 
                         You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's 
                         getting real old real fast, dude.

               Miles looks down. Jack heads for the door.

                                     JACK
                         Later.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, well, maybe you should check 
                         your messages first.

               Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously. Miles tosses Jack his 
               phone. Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb. 
               He doesn't like what he sees.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, boy.

                                     MILES
                              (pointing at the room 
                              phone)
                         She's been leaving messages here 
                         too.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. Okay.

               He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.

                                     MILES
                         You should call her.

                                     JACK
                         I will.
                              (heading out the door)
                         See ya!

                                     MILES
                         Right now.

                                     JACK
                         Okay! Jesus!

               Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly 
               at Miles.

                                     JACK
                         I've got no problem calling her.

               Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to 
               his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE.

                                     JACK
                              (opening his phone)
                         Wait outside, will you?

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         That was fun last night.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a 
                         wine collection. Very impressive.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this 
                         morning. She said she had a good 
                         time too. You should call her.

               Miles says nothing.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Where's Jack?

                                     MILES
                         He had to make a phone call.

               Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it 
               up on the kickstand.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         So what are you up to today, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't 
                         know. Jack and I were supposed to go 
                         golfing.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Huh.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I reserved the tee time about 
                         a month ago.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Oops. Sorry.

                                     MILES
                         You golf?

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid 
                         game. I mean, at least, I could never 
                         get into it. I tried it once.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about 
                         it.

               Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door.

                                     JACK
                              (hushed)
                         Hey Miles. Miles.

               Miles ducks back inside.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                     JACK
                         Do you have that other condom?

               Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil 
               square.

                                     MILES
                         What'd Christine say?

                                     JACK
                         Lucked out -- got voice mail. 
                         Everything's cool.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - CONTINUOUS

               Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child 
               on Christmas morning.

               Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie, 
               grasping her waist.

               Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the 
               balcony.

               CLOSE ON MILES --

               As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

               Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP, 
               SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of 
               solitude.

               INT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of 
               complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS.

               Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST 
               ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course 
               winery after winery.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY

               Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers. 
               He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS 
               play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.

               OVER MILES'S SHOULDER --

               The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling 
               errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding 
               a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"

               CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked 
               with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue. 
               Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH.

               LATER --

               Miles checks his machine.

                                     SYNTHESIZED VOICE (O.S.)
                         No new messages.

               He hangs up, disgusted.

               EXT. CHINA PANDA RESTAURANT - DAY

               A small Buellton eatery.

               INT. CHINA PANDA - DAY

               The only customer right now, Miles eats awkwardly with his 
               chopsticks.

               EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY

               Miles DRIVES ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release 
               his frustration.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast.

               INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

               Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn 
               the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station. Then 
               all of a sudden --

               WHUMP! The car has struck something with a hideous sound 
               followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an 
               injured DOG in the Saab's wake. Miles applies the BRAKES.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --

               A DOG

               scampering into the nearby woods. Miles looks around -- has 
               anyone seen him? Is there a nearby residence? Finding nothing, 
               Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING 
               CHASE.

               He follows the path of the dog into --

               EXT. ROADSIDE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

               Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his 
               way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill-
               fated cur.

               After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads 
               back.

               OMIT.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               Miles has returned to where he hit the dog. Just then, Miles 
               notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the 
               road. They disappear into the bushes.

               Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs 
               behind the wheel and speeds away.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               The Saab pulls into the parking lot.

               EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Miles trudges up the stops to the room. He opens the door 
               and sees --

               JACK

               atop Stephanie, plowing her fertile fields. Despite the 
               interruption, their pace does not alter.

                                     JACK
                         Not now! Not now!

               Miles quickly shuts the door.

               INT. WINDMILL SPORTS BAR LOUNGE - DAY

               Miles pours himself another glass of Pinot. Jack comes in 
               and spots his morose friend.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, there you are.

                                     MILES
                         Yep.

                                     JACK
                         What're you drinking?

               Jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label. Miles 
               remains cool to Jack's amiability.

                                     JACK
                         Any good?

               Miles shrugs.

                                     JACK
                              (to the bartender)
                         Could I get a glass please?
                              (to Miles)
                         Stephanie took me out into the Pinot 
                         fields today. It was awesome. I think 
                         I finally got a handle on the whole 
                         process, from the soil to the vine 
                         to the -- what do you call it? -- 
                         selection and harvest. And the whole, 
                         you know, big containers where they 
                         mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes 
                         right off the vine.
                              (the new expert)
                         Still a little sour but already 
                         showing potential for great structure. 
                         Stephanie really knows her shit, 
                         Miles.

               Jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.

                                     MILES
                         Where is Stephanie?

                                     JACK
                         Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.

                                     MILES
                         What the fuck are you doing?

                                     JACK
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         With this chick.

               Jack just looks at him.

                                     MILES
                         Does she know about Saturday?

                                     JACK
                         Um... not exactly. But I've been 
                         honest. I haven't told her I'm 
                         available. And she knows this trip 
                         up here is only for a few days. 
                         Besides...

               Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship.

                                     MILES
                         Besides what?

                                     JACK
                         Well... I don't know, just... the 
                         wedding.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         Well, I've been doing some thinking.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, you've been thinking. And?

                                     JACK
                         I may have to put the wedding on 
                         hold is all.

               Miles looks at him with incredulity.

                                     JACK
                         I fully realize that making a change 
                         like that might be tricky for certain 
                         people to accept at first, but life 
                         is short, Miles. I've got to be sure 
                         I'm doing the right thing before 
                         taking such a big step. And not just 
                         for my sake. I'm thinking about 
                         Christine's feelings too. I take 
                         marriage very seriously -- always 
                         have. That's why I've never done it 
                         before. The day I get married, it's 
                         going to be the real thing.

               Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.

                                     JACK
                         Being with Stephanie has opened my 
                         eyes. She's not uptight or 
                         controlling. She's just cool. Things 
                         are so easy with her. Smells 
                         different. Tastes different. Fucks 
                         different. Fucks like an animal. I'm 
                         telling you, I went deep last night, 
                         Miles. Deep.

                                     MILES
                         Deep.

               Miles draws a long sigh.

                                     JACK
                         Don't get all judgmental on me. This 
                         is my deal. It's my life, and it's 
                         my call.

               They fall silent for a moment. Then --

                                     JACK
                         I was hoping to get some understanding 
                         from you. And I'm not getting it.

                                     MILES
                         Understanding of what?

                                     JACK
                         Like I might be in love with another 
                         woman.

                                     MILES
                         In love? Twenty-four hours with some 
                         wine-pourer chick and you think you're 
                         in love? And give up everything?

                                     JACK
                         Look who's talking. You've been there.

                                     MILES
                         Yes I have, and do I look like a 
                         happy man? Was all that drama with 
                         Brenda a happy thing for me to do? 
                         Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my 
                         life now?

                                     JACK
                         This is totally different. I'm talking 
                         about avoiding what you're talking 
                         about. That's the distinction. I 
                         have not made the commitment yet. I 
                         am not married. I have not said the 
                         words. In a few days, I might get 
                         married, and if I do, then I won't 
                         be doing stuff like this anymore. 
                         Otherwise, what's the whole point of 
                         getting married?

                                     MILES
                         And what about Stephanie? She's a 
                         woman -- with a kid. A single mom. 
                         What do you think she's looking for? 
                         Huh?

                                     JACK
                              (interrupting)
                         Here's what I'm thinking. We move up 
                         here, you and me, buy a vineyard. 
                         You design your own wine; I'll handle 
                         the business side. Then you get 
                         inspired and write a new novel. As 
                         for me, if an audition comes along, 
                         hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.

                                     MILES
                         You're crazy. You've gone crazy.

                                     JACK
                         What do you care anyway? You don't 
                         even like Christine.

                                     MILES
                         What? Of course I like Christine.

                                     JACK
                         You said she was shallow. Yeah, and 
                         a nouveau riche.

                                     MILES
                         That was three years ago after that 
                         first party!

                                     JACK
                         Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an 
                         actor. All I have is my instinct.
                              (his hand on his chest)
                         My intuition -- that's all I have. 
                         And you're asking me to go against 
                         it. And that's just wrong.

               Just then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he 
               kisses the top of her head.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Hi, guys. We should probably get 
                         going.

                                     MILES
                         Where?

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DUSK

               CLOSE ON A VIDEO GAME MONITOR

               as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often 
               leaving the road, much like Jack's libido.

               ZOOM OUT

               to reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they 
               drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles.

               Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, 
               two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL.

                                     CARYL
                         Stephanie's heard this a thousand 
                         times, but if I'd done what I wanted 
                         and I'd bought up in Santa Maria 
                         when I had the chance, I would have 
                         made a fortune when they put in that 
                         outlet center and that Home Depot.
                              (a drag off her 
                              cigarette, then to 
                              Stephanie)
                         Your father knew it too, but he was 
                         a fucking chickenshit. Always was.

               Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and 
               Siena, so completely happy together.

               Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is 
               equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best 
               not to shake his head in disgust.

               INT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - DUSK

               Caryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie 
               gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside.

                                     JACK
                         Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph 
                         and Siena get home safe, and then 
                         maybe we'll hook up with you later, 
                         okay?

                                     MILES
                              (dispirited)
                         Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a 
                         movie.

               Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car 
               next to her mom.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         See you, Miles. You take care.

                                     MILES
                         Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.

                                     SIENA AND CARYL
                         Bye, Miles.

               As he gets in the car --

                                     JACK
                         Call me on my cell if you go out.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah.

               Miles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab.

               INT. MINI-MART - DUSK

               CLOSE ON THE COUNTER --

               as Miles places a box of security ENVELOPES, a packet of 
               BEEF JERKY and some TROPICAL FRUIT SKITTLES.

               WIDE --

               Miles points over the CASHIER'S SHOULDER.

                                     MILES
                         And could I get a Barely Leqal?

               As the cashier reaches for the magazine --

                                     MILES
                         NO, um, the new one.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Miles is once again FLOSSING.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               POP! Miles opens a bottle of Pinot and pours himself a glass. 
               He carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on 
               the bed and opens his magazine.

               NOW SNEEZING ATOP THE BED -- ANGLE ON TOP OF HIM --

               The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with 
               a start and looks at the clock-radio. He thinks a moment, 
               takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed.

               CLOSE ON A WATER-SAVER SHOWER HEAD --

               as little needles of water come at us.

               THROUGH THE BATHROOM DOOR --

               Miles takes a nice hot SHOWER. But wait -- he has forgotten 
               to put the shower curtain inside the tub. A closer look 
               reveals a growing PUDDLE OF WATER on the floor.

               EXT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT

               Miles walks across the parking lot. He pauses before entering, 
               then forces himself to take the leap.

               INT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT

               Miles affects nonchalance as he searches briefly for Maya. 
               He continues on into the BAR.

                         You know me. I love it up here. How 
                         about you?

                         wine tour. Usually they're not too 
                         rowdy, but tonight there was something 
                         going on. Full moon or something. 
                         What can I get you?

               Miles just smiles.

               WIDE --

               Gary serves Miles, alone at the bar. Miles takes his first 
               drink.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, that's tasty.

               EXT. HITCHING POST - NIGHT

               It's closing time. The front door flies open, and Miles 
               staggers out sideways. Gary follows him out, concerned.

                         You okay, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         I'm good.

               Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes 
               his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill.

               FADE OUT.

               UNDER BLACK, A CARD --

                                        WEDNESDAY

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               The door bursts open, and Jack comes bounding in.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, dude. Let's go golfing! I 
                         got us in at Alisal.

               Miles comes to, very hungover.

                                     MILES
                         That's a public course.
                              (then --)
                         No Stephanie?

                                     JACK
                         She's working. I need a break anyway. 
                         She's getting a little clingy.
                              (magnanimous)
                         This is our day!

               EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

               WHACK! Jack TEES OFF with a manly athletic swing and shades 
               his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory.

                                     JACK
                         Crap.

               Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks 
               a tee in the ground and sets his ball.

                                     JACK
                         Did you ever got ahold of Maya 
                         yesterday?

                                     MILES
                         Nope.

                                     JACK
                         She likes you, man. Stephanie'll 
                         tell you.

                                     MILES
                              (preparing to swing)
                         Can you give me some room here?

                                     JACK
                              (stepping back)
                         Oh yeah. Sure.

               Miles lifts his club.

                                     JACK
                         You know, in life you gotta strike 
                         when the iron's hot.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks, Jack.

               Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful 
               advice.

                                     JACK
                         Don't whiff it.

               WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good, 
               long drive.

                                     JACK
                         Nice shot.

                                     MILES
                         You're an asshole.

               NOW ON THE FAIRWAY --

               Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to 
               take his next swing.

                                     JACK
                         What about your agent? Hear anything 
                         yet?

                                     MILES
                         Nope.

                                     JACK
                         What do you think's going on?

                                     MILES
                         Could be anything.

                                     JACK
                         Been checking your messages?

                                     MILES
                         Obsessively.

                                     JACK
                         Huh.

                                     MILES
                         They probably think my book is such 
                         a piece of shit that it's not even 
                         worthy of a response. I guess I'll 
                         just have to learn how to kiss off 
                         three years of my life.

                                     JACK
                         But you don't know yet, so your 
                         negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't 
                         you say?

               Miles says nothing.

                                     JACK
                         Or fuck those New York publishers. 
                         Publish it yourself. I'll chip in. 
                         Just get it out there, get it 
                         reviewed, get it in libraries. Let 
                         the public decide.

               Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's 
               talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.

                                     JACK
                         Don't come over the top. Stay still.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up.

                                     JACK
                         Just trying to be helpful.
                              (a moment later)
                         It's all about stillness, Miles. 
                         Inner quiet.

               Miles drops his club and turns to Jack.

                                     MILES
                         Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's 
                         the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!

                                     JACK
                         Why are you so hostile? I know you're 
                         frustrated with your life right now, 
                         but you can choose not to be so 
                         hostile.
                              (holding out a cup of 
                              wine)
                         Here.

               Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a 
               taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes.

                                     MILES
                         What is it?

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

               Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. Let me see the label.

               Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly 
               behind them.

                                     JACK
                              (whirling around)
                         What the fuck?

               Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME 
               of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver.

                                     HUSBAND #1
                              (shouting, barely 
                              audible)
                         Hurry it up, will you?

               Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous.

                                     MILES
                         Fucker hit into us.

                                     JACK
                              (yelling)
                         Hey, asshole! That's not cool!

                                     MILES
                         Throw me his ball.

               Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it 
               to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts 
               it back low and hard.

                                     JACK
                         Nice shot.

               THE COUPLES

               duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads.

               JACK AND MILES

               laugh hard.

               THE TWO HUSBANDS

               climb in their CART and hasten down the fairway toward Jack 
               and Miles.

               JACK

               watches their approach, grinning.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, this is going to be fun.
                              (jerking a driver 
                              from his bag)
                         This is going to be fun.

               Jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a 
               medieval knight with a mace.

               As the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their 
               cart around and speed back toward their wives.

                                     JACK
                         Hit into us again, motherfuckers, 
                         and I'll ass-rape all four of you!

               EXT. GOLF COURSE CLUBHOUSE - DAY

               Jack and Miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their 
               clubs over their shoulders.

                                     JACK
                         Just don't give up on Maya. Cool 
                         smart chicks like that --they like 
                         persistence.

                                     MILES
                         I don't want to talk about it.

                                     JACK
                         All I know is she's beautiful. Lots 
                         of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not 
                         going to feel good about this trip 
                         until you guys hook up. Don't you 
                         just want to feel that cozy little 
                         box grip down on your Johnson?

               Nearby a GOLFER is with his YOUNG SON.

                                     GOLFER
                         Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?

               EXT. GOLF COURSE PARKING LOT - DAY

               Miles and Jack walk toward their car.

                                     JACK
                         Is it the money thing?

                                     MILES
                         Is what the money thing?

                                     JACK
                         With Maya.

                                     MILES
                         Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman 
                         finds out how I live, that I'm not a 
                         published author, that I'm a liar 
                         essentially, then yeah, any interest 
                         is gonna evaporate real quick. If 
                         you don't have money at my age, you're 
                         not even in the game. You're just a 
                         pasture animal waiting for the 
                         abattoir.

                                     JACK
                         Is an abattoir like a... like a... 
                         what is that?

                                     MILES
                         Slaughterhouse.

                                     JACK
                         Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to 
                         get the good news this week about 
                         your book. I know you are. I can 
                         feel it.

               Jack's CELLPHONE rings, and he checks the caller ID.

                                     JACK
                         It's Steph.
                              (picking up)
                         Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I 
                         mean I would, but let me see. Hey, 
                         Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going. 
                         We'll be right there. Me too.

               He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles.

                                     JACK
                         We're on.

                                     MILES
                         What's happening?

                                     JACK
                         We're going to have some fun. Remember 
                         fun? We're going to have some of it. 
                         Okay?

                                     MILES
                         What exactly are we going to do?

                                     JACK
                         I said okay?

                                     MILES
                         You have to tell me --

                                     JACK
                         I SAID OKAY?

               Miles finally smiles.

                                     MILES
                         Okay.

               OMITTED

                                                 BIG FUN MUSIC BEGINS OVER:

               EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS OLIVOS - DAY

               A HIGH WIDE SHOT --

               The Saab pulls up where Stephanie and Maya await with bottles 
               of wine and a PICNIC BASKET. The girls climb into the back 
               seat, and the car speeds away.

               INT./EXT. THE SAAB - DAY

               They're going FAST, hair whipping around.

                                     MAYA
                         Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the 
                         restaurant last night looking for 
                         me.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped 
                         by for a drink. Didn't see you.

                                     MAYA
                         I had class.

                                     MILES
                         Well, nice to see you now.

                                     MAYA
                         You too.

               EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROAD - DAY

               WHOOSH! That car's going a little too FAST!

               INT./EXT. LA PURISIMA MISSION CHURCH

               The two couples wander around this historic site.

               EXT. IDYLLIC PICNIC SPOT - DAY INTO DUSK

               The girls have led them to a beautiful spot.

               IN A SERIES OF SHOTS --

               we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but 
               there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even 
               Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness 
               from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other 
               as they eat and sip wine.

               Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET.

               EXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING

               The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed 
               toward the main building.

               INT. WINERY #3 - EVENING

               A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress. 
               He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the 
               few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention.

               IN THE AUDIENCE --

               As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles.

                                     JACK
                         You ever actually read any of this 
                         guy's books?

                                     MILES
                         He wrote a great one on Burgundy, 
                         and I used to get his newsletter, 
                         but then there were doubts about 
                         whether he does all his own tasting. 
                         Plus a couple of times he declared 
                         certain years vintages of the century, 
                         and they turned out to be turkeys. 
                         Fucker never retracted.

                                     JACK
                         Huh.

               Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a 
               GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles 
               protests at first, they stand and leave.

               AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM --

               Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is 
               open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside --

               INT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless 
               steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS.

               As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are 
               entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away.

               LATER --

               In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank, 
               kissing.

               CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in 
               the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge 
               of kissing but holding back.

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES...

               INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table.

               WIDE --

               The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table. 
               They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in 
               LAUGHTER.

               A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes. 
               Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his 
               arms, and takes her back to bed.

               EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Saab pulls away from the house.

               INT. SAAB - NIGHT

               Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand 
               at the Saab.

               EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little 
               woozy from the hours of drinking.

               AT THE DOOR --

               Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles 
               hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear?

               Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans 
               forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is 
               immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long 
               KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes 
               the door in our face.

               The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.

                                           MUSIC ENDS AND SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH --

                                         THURSDAY

               The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a 
               blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand 
               picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to -- 

               INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste.

               Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops 
               the paper on the dining table and continues into --

               THE BEDROOM --

               where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly 
               face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly.

               Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot.

               EXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY

               This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic 
               produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.

               Maya and Miles are shopping. Miles carries the bags.

               EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

               Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by 
               the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER. 
               Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

                                     MAYA
                         You guys should stop by the restaurant 
                         for lunch today.

                                     MILES
                         Great. What's the latest we can get 
                         there?

                                     MAYA
                         About two-thirty.

                                     MILES
                         Okay.

                                     MAYA
                              (noticing)
                         Did you hear about this Bordeaux 
                         tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara 
                         Saturday night? It's a little pricey, 
                         but if you wanted to go, I'd be into 
                         it. Why don't you stay through the 
                         weekend?

               Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it 
               down --

                                     MILES
                         No, we've got to get back Friday for 
                         the rehearsal dinner.

                                     MAYA
                         What rehearsal dinner?

               Miles stops writing.

                                     MAYA
                         Who's getting married?

               INT./EXT. PARKING AREA NEAR THE ORCHARD - DAY

               Maya leads the way toward the Saab.

                                     MAYA
                         Were you ever going to say anything?

                                     MILES
                         Of course I was. I mean, just now I 
                         could have made up some story, but I 
                         didn't. I told you the truth.

               Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break." 
               Miles reaches out to touch her.

                                     MILES
                         Maya.

                                     MAYA
                              (jerking away)
                         Don't touch me. Just take me home.

               INT. SAAB - DAY

               Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares 
               straight ahead.

                                     MILES
                         I've told him. I've told him over 
                         and over, but he's out of control.

                                     MAYA
                         Do you know what he's been saying to 
                         her?

                                     MILES
                         He's an actor, so it can't be good.

                                     MAYA
                         Oh, just that he loves her. That 
                         she's the only woman who has ever 
                         really rocked his world. How he adores 
                         Siena. How he wants to move up here 
                         and get a place with the two of them 
                         and commute when he has to.

                                     MILES
                         I'm sure he believed every word.

               A stony silence.

                                     MILES
                         Please believe me. I was even on the 
                         verge of telling you last night, 
                         but...

                                     MAYA
                         But you wanted to fuck me first.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, Maya. No.

                                     MAYA
                         Yeah.

               EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins 
               to get out.

                                     MAYA
                         You know, I just spent three years 
                         trying to extricate myself from a 
                         relationship that turned out to be 
                         full of deception. And I've been 
                         doing just fine.

                                     MILES
                         And I haven't been with anyone since 
                         my divorce. This has been a big deal 
                         for me, Maya -- hanging out with 
                         you, and last night. I really like 
                         you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm 
                         just his... his freshman roommate 
                         from San Diego State.

               Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't 
               just yet.

                                     MAYA
                         Could I have my paper, please?

               Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back 
               seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches 
               until she goes inside.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               Miles pulls up and parks.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and 
               is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big BEARHUG. The 
               TV is on, perhaps showing an E! True Hollywood Story.

                                     JACK
                         Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my 
                         boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is 
                         yo' daddy?

                                     MILES
                         Put me down, Jack.

               Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night.

                                     MILES
                         I said put me down. Jack!

               Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of 
               them onto the bed. Now on top of Miles, Jack KISSES both 
               cheeks.

                                     JACK
                         I'm so proud of you! Let me love 
                         you!

               Now they get up off the bed.

                                     JACK
                         So tell me everything. Details. I 
                         like details.

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     JACK
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         It's private.

                                     JACK
                         You're kidding, right? Tell me what 
                         happened, you fucker, or I'll tie 
                         your dick in a knot.

                                     MILES
                         Let's leave it alone.

               Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.

                                     JACK
                         You didn't get any, did you?
                              (off Miles's silence)
                         You're a homo.

                                     MILES
                         Just stop, okay? Make something up, 
                         and that's what happened. Whatever 
                         you want. Write my confession, and 
                         I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me 
                         all the time! I can't take it! You're 
                         an infant! This is all a big party 
                         for you, but not for me! This is 
                         serious. And you -- Just... leave me 
                         alone, okay? You're fucking me up.

                                     JACK
                         Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.

               Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and 
               sensitively puts one arm around his friend.

                                     JACK
                         Did you have trouble performing? 
                         Yeah, that's...

                                     MILES
                         Shut up! Shut up, Jack!

               The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the 
               ominous sound.

                                     MILES
                         Don't answer it.

               But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game 
               of Russian roulette.

                                     MILES
                         I'm telling you, don't.

               Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.

                                     JACK
                         Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? 
                         Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
                              (mouthing)
                         Christine.

               Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. 
               His face is dark with resentment.

                                     JACK
                         Listen, honey. Let me call you back. 
                         Miles and I are in the middle of 
                         something. No, it's nothing serious -- 
                         Miles is just having one of his freak-
                         outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call 
                         you right back.

               Jack hangs up.

                                     MILES
                         This whole week has gone sour. It 
                         isn't turning out like it was supposed 
                         to.
                              (deadly serious)
                         I want to go home.

                                     JACK
                         Who's being selfish now? I'm the one 
                         getting married. I thought this week 
                         was supposed to be about me.

                                     MILES
                         We gotta slow down.
                              (closing his eyes)
                         I'm so tired. Let's just get out of 
                         here.

                                     JACK
                         I know what you need.

               INT. SEARS - DAY

               Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE 
               ties Miles's laces.

                                     SALES ASSOCIATE
                         There you go.

               Miles gets up and walks in a circle.

                                     MILES
                         Do you like them?

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're 
                         really sporty.

                                     MILES
                         Are they too sporty?

               INT. MALL - DAY

               The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying 
               a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle.

                                     JACK
                         Feel better?

               Miles shrugs.

                                     JACK
                              (noticing something)
                         Oh here, wait a second. I want to 
                         run in here real quick.

               He heads toward a TOYS STORE.

                                     JACK
                              (over his shoulder)
                         I want to get something for Siena.

               Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They 
               pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to 
               turn in.

                                     JACK
                         How about this one? We didn't hit 
                         this one.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.

                                     JACK
                         You ever actually been in there, 
                         Miles?

                                     MILES
                         I don't have to.

                                     JACK
                              (turning the wheel)
                         I say we check it out. You never 
                         know.

               EXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

               The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS, 
               whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of 
               letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.

               INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

               The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display 
               after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate 
               sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the 
               winery's logo.

               In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays 
               soothing Windham Hill-ish music.

               The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended 
               to by HARRIED POURERS.

               Finally the POURER gets to their glasses. Miles chews a sip 
               and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.

                                     MILES
                         Tastes like the back of a fucking LA 
                         schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, 
                         hoping for some semblance of 
                         concentration, crushed it up with 
                         leaves and mice, wound up with this 
                         rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash 
                         bullshit. Fucking Raid.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Tastes okay to me.
                              (looking at the tasting 
                              sheet)
                         Hey, they got a reserve pinot.

                                     MILES
                         Let me use your phone.

                                     JACK
                              (handing it over)
                         What's up?

                                     MILES
                         I can't take it anymore. I've got to 
                         call Evelyn.

               EXT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

               Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone 
               to his ear.

                                     ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
                         Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

                                     MILES
                         Hi, it's Miles.

                                     ASSISTANT (ON THE PHONE)
                         Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can 
                         get her.
                              (a moment later)
                         You're in luck. I'll put you through.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite 
                         client.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         How's the trip?

                                     MILES
                         Good, good. Drinking some good wines 
                         and kicking back, you know. So what's 
                         happening? Still no word?

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Actually there is word. I spoke to 
                         Keith Kurtzman this morning.

                                     MILES
                         And?

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         And... they're passing. Conundrum's 
                         passing. He said they really liked 
                         it. They really wanted to do it, but 
                         they just couldn't figure out how to 
                         market it. He said it was a tough 
                         call.

                                     MILES
                         Huh.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm sorry, Miles.
                              (off his silence)
                         So I don't know where that leaves 
                         us. I'm not sure how much more mileage 
                         I can get out of continuing to submit 
                         it. I think it's one of those 
                         unfortunate cases in the business 
                         right now -- a fabulous book with no 
                         home. The whole industry's gotten 
                         gutless. It's not about the quality 
                         of the books. It's about the 
                         marketing.

               Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to 
               sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.

               EXT. DEEP CANYON - INSERT

               Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending 
               vertiginously across a great CHASM.

               EXT. LARGE WINERY - BACK AGAIN

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Are you there? Miles?

                                     MILES
                         Yeah, I'm here.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. 
                         You've been a real trooper.
                              (loudly, to her 
                              assistant)
                         Tell him I'll call back.

                                     MILES
                         So I guess that's it.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         You're a wonderful writer, Miles. 
                         Don't be discouraged.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax 
               and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clichés of consolation 
               continue in his head.

                                     EVELYN (ON THE PHONE)
                         Just hang in there, and who knows? 
                         After you get something else 
                         published, we can revisit this one. 
                         And next time we can try a different 
                         title.

               Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt 
               to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening.

               INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

               Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds 
               and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting 
               station. He pushes his way to front.

               The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it 
               back, immediately extending his glass for more.

                                     MILES
                         Hit me again.

               The same small amount is poured and downed. Once again Miles 
               holds out his glass.

                                     MILES
                         Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for 
                         it.

                                     POURER
                         This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.

               Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table.

                                     MILES
                         Just give me a full goddamn pour.

               The pourer turns away to serve another party. Miles looks 
               around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic 
               to this injustice.

               Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right 
               up to the brim and beyond.

                                     POURER
                         Sir, what are you doing?

                                     MILES
                         I told you I need a drink.

                                     POURER
                         Then buy a bottle and go outside.

               The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink.

                                     POURER
                         Put the glass down.

               In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby 
               steps back.

                                     POURER
                         You're going to have to leave, sir.

               The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the 
               room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over.

               Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts 
               to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto 
               his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.

               The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags 
               him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up.

                                     JACK
                              (to the horrified 
                              onlookers)
                         It's all right. His mother just died.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY

               Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES, 
               crashing into the water and disappearing from view.

               Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the 
               ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.

                                     JACK
                         Just write another one. You have 
                         lots of ideas, right?

                                     MILES
                         No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. 
                         I'm a middle-school English teacher. 
                         I'm going to spend the rest of my 
                         life grading essays and reading the 
                         works of others. It's okay. I like 
                         books. The world doesn't give a shit 
                         what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.
                              (a dark laugh)
                         I'm so insignificant, I can't even 
                         kill myself.

                                     JACK
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     MILES
                         You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, 
                         Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't 
                         kill yourself before you've even 
                         been published.

                                     JACK
                         What about that guy who wrote 
                         Confederacy of Dunces? He committed 
                         suicide before he got published, and 
                         look how famous he is.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks.

                                     JACK
                         Don't give up. You're going to make 
                         it.

                                     MILES
                         Half my life is over, and I have 
                         nothing to show for it. I'm a 
                         thumbprint on the window of a 
                         skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement 
                         on a tissue surging out to sea with 
                         a million tons of raw sewage.

                                     JACK
                         See? Right there. Just what you just 
                         said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint 
                         on a skyscraper. I couldn't write 
                         that.

                                     MILES
                         Neither could I. I think it's 
                         Bukowski.

               Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.

               EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

               ZOOM! There goes the Saab.

               The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG, 
               now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

               Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot.

                                     JACK
                              (lighting up)
                         Oh, look. There's Steph!

               He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see --

               STEPHANIE

               seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her 
               lap, watching patiently as --

               THE SAAB

               pulls to a stop in a parking space.

               Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches 
               in the backseat for his Sears bag.

                                     JACK
                              (calling out)
                         Hey, baby.

               Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack 
               reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.

                                     JACK
                         Look what I got for our favorite 
                         girl.

               Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging 
               the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms 
               with rage.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

               She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.

               Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands 
               over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he 
               rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed 
               lion.

               Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out 
               of range.

                                     MILES
                         Stephanie! Stop!

                                     STEPHANIE
                         You fucking bastard! Lying piece of 
                         shit! You're getting married on 
                         Saturday? What was all that shit you 
                         said to me?

                                     JACK
                         I can explain.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         You said you loved me! You fuck! I 
                         hope you die!

               With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet, 
               she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.

                                     STEPHANIE
                         Fuckface!
                              (to Miles)
                         You too!

               As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded 
               friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses 
               a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.

                                     MILES
                         Aren't you glad you didn't move up 
                         here and marry her?

                                     JACK
                         Don't need a lecture. You fucking 
                         told Maya, didn't you?

                                     MILES
                         No, I did not. Must have been Gary 
                         at the Hitching Post. I think we 
                         mentioned it to him the first night.

                                     JACK
                         You told him. I'm fucking hurting 
                         here.

                                     MILES
                         Keep it elevated.

               INT. HOSPITAL ER WAITING ROOM - DAY

               CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled "24 Ways 
               To Please Your Man."

               WIDER --

               Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a 
               garbage can held by his FATHER. An OLD WOMAN parked in a 
               wheelchair faces the wall.

               LATER --

               Miles is at a PAYPHONE. As he speaks he tries to peel off 
               the metal LONG DISTANCE STICKER.

                                     MAYA (ON THE PHONE)
                         Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.

                                     MILES
                         It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if 
                         you even care, but I had to call and 
                         tell you again how much I enjoyed 
                         our time together and how sorry I am 
                         things turned out the way they did. 
                         I think you're great, Maya -- always 
                         have. From the first time you waited 
                         on me.
                              (bracing himself)
                         And while I'm at it, I guess you 
                         should know that my book is not 
                         getting published. I thought this 
                         one had a chance, but I was wrong. 
                         Again. Don't bother reading it -- 
                         you've got better things to do. So 
                         you see I'm not much of a writer. 
                         I'm not anything really. The only 
                         real talent I seem to have is for 
                         disappointing people and now you 
                         know that firsthand. We're leaving 
                         in the morning, and I want you to 
                         know that I take with me wonderful 
                         memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really 
                         sorry.

               What else to say? He hangs up.

               He returns to his seat. A moment later he extends his legs 
               to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.

               LATER --

               Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency 
               room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE 
               BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place. Miles walks with 
               him toward the exit.

                                     MILES
                         Well?

                                     JACK
                         I'm going to need an operation. Maybe 
                         a couple of them. They have to wait 
                         for it it to heal first. Then they 
                         break it again.

                                     MILES
                         Good thing you have a voice-over 
                         career.

                                     JACK
                         Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue 
                         her ass. Only reason I won't is to 
                         protect Christine.

                                     MILES
                         That's thoughtful.

                                     JACK
                              (disgusted)
                         Yeah.

               They walk by us and out the door.

               EXT. STREET IN SOLVANG - DAY

               Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost 
               fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes, 
               he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An 
               ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window. 
               He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see 
               a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed 
               in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack 
               takes a slug of wine.

               Just then Miles gets back in the car.

                                     JACK
                         I hate this place.

               Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills. 
               A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.

                                     MILES
                         Take a couple of these, and you'll 
                         learn to love it.

               Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.

                                     MILES
                         Two for you. And two for me.

               Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles, 
               who follows suit.

               EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - EVENING

               Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first 
               time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.

                                     JACK
                         So how did Stephanie know it was 
                         Saturday? We didn't get into that 
                         with Gary.

                                     MILES
                         Huh. Let me think.

                                     JACK
                         You sure you didn't say anything to 
                         Maya?

                                     MILES
                         Sure I'm sure. And just what are you 
                         implying? I'm really pissed off at 
                         you about all this, if you want to 
                         know the truth. What's Maya going to 
                         think of me now just for associating 
                         with you? You're the one who's 
                         sabotaging me, not the other way 
                         around, pal. Not by a longshot.

               Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Just seems fishy.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the TV. 
               Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser MIRROR like a 
               large dog who has just been neutered.

                                     JACK
                         What's it look like to you?

                                     MILES
                         Looks like you were in a bad car 
                         accident.

               Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking. Then he looks 
               back in the mirror.

                                     JACK
                         I'm hungry.

               EXT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT

               Establishing. Thursday night is Cajun Wings Night.

               INT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT

               Miles and Jack are finishing their SALADS in the rustic- 
               themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies.

                                     JACK
                         You know what I'm thinking?

                                     MILES
                         What's that?

                                     JACK
                         I'm thinking it's time to settle 
                         down. One woman. One house. You know. 
                         It's time.

                                     MILES
                         Uh-huh.

               Jack nods his head with no self-awareness or acknowledgment 
               of the irony.

               NOW TWO PLATES ARRIVE

               mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed 
               potatoes.

                                     JACK
                         Mm. Mm.

               Their cheery, saftig blonde WAITRESS removes several FOIL 
               PACKETS from her apron and places them on the table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         And here're your Handi-wipes.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, so that's what those are? For a 
                         second there I thought you guys were 
                         promoting safe sex.

               The waitress OVER-LAUGHS and swipes a hand at her naughty 
               customer.

                                     WAITRESS
                         I'll be right back with more corn 
                         bread.

               Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles.

                                     JACK
                         I bet you that chick is two tons of 
                         fun. You know, the grateful type.

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. I wouldn't know.

               Now she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET. 
               Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks. 
               When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket 
               using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively.

                                     JACK
                         Nice technique there...
                              (checking her name 
                              tag)
                         ...Cammi.

                                     CAMMI
                         It's all in the wrist.
                              (a moment later)
                         You know, you look really familiar. 
                         You from around here? Where'd you go 
                         to high school?

                                     JACK
                         No, we're from San Diego. Why?

                                     CAMMI
                         I don't know. You just seem really 
                         familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy 
                         your meals.

                                     JACK
                         Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek 
                         Sommersby?

                                     CAMMI
                         Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean 
                         from "One Life to Live"?

               Miles looks away and sighs.

                                     JACK
                         You have to imagine him with a bandage 
                         and shorter hair.

               As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment.

                                     CAMMI
                         No. Way. No way!

               Jack smiles and nods.

                                     CAMMI
                         Oh, my God!

                                     MILES
                         Could you tell me where the bathroom 
                         is?

                                     CAMMI
                              (her eyes barely 
                              leaving Jack)
                         Uh, sure, it's right over there, 
                         right past the buffalo.

               IN A WIDE SHOT --

               Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's 
               flirtation with Cammi continues.

               The camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through 
               the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame 
               with the word "MEN."

               LATER --

               A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense 
               one.

               WIDER --

               Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he 
               watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way.

                                     JACK
                         She gets off in an hour, so I think 
                         I'm just going to have a drink and 
                         then... make sure she gets home safe.

                                     MILES
                         You're joking, right?
                              (seeing that he isn't)
                         What are you doing? Un-fucking-
                         believeable. Can we just go back to 
                         the hotel and hang out and get up 
                         early and play nine holes before we 
                         head home?

               Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, 
               thinking how best to put it.

                                     JACK
                         Look, Miles. I know you're my friend 
                         and you care about me. And I know 
                         you disapprove. I respect that. But 
                         there are some things I have to do 
                         that you don't understand. You 
                         understand wine and literature and 
                         movies, but you don't understand my 
                         plight. And that's okay.

               CLOSE ON MILES --

               as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               UNDER BLACK, SUPERIMPOSED --

                                          FRIDAY

               Now comes the sound of hysterical KNOCKING.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

               Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his 
               expression serene.

               Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening 
               it to find --

               JACK

               silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. He is 
               barefoot. In fact he is clad only in his UNDERWEAR. Hugging 
               himself, he PANTS and SHIVERS.

                                     JACK
                         Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.

               He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them 
               around himself.

                                     JACK
                         Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My 
                         nose.

               Miles hands him the bottle, and Jack frantically pops a couple 
               of pills, chewing them like candy. He sits down and bends 
               over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking chick's married.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         Her husband works a night shift or 
                         something, and he comes home, and 
                         I'm on the floor with my cock in his 
                         wife's ass.

                                     MILES
                         Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked 
                         all the way back from Solvang?

                                     JACK
                         Ran. Twisted my ankle too.

                                     MILES
                         That's five clicks, Jackson.

                                     JACK
                         Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one 
                         point I had to cut through an ostrich 
                         farm. Fuckers are mean.

               Miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole 
               scene, and he LAUGHS HARD. The blanketed bulge just sits 
               there. Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage.

                                     JACK
                         We gotta go back.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     JACK
                         I left my wallet. My credit cards, 
                         cash, fucking ID, everything. We 
                         gotta go back.

                                     MILES
                         Big deal. We'll call right now and 
                         cancel your cards.

                                     JACK
                         You don't understand. The wedding 
                         bands. The wedding bands are in my 
                         wallet.

                                     MILES
                         Okay, so they were in your wallet, 
                         and you left your wallet somewhere. 
                         Some bar. Christine'll understand.

                                     JACK
                         No. She ordered them special. Took 
                         her forever to find them. They've 
                         got this design on them with dolphins 
                         and our names engraved in Sanskrit. 
                         We've got to go back. Christine'll 
                         fucking crucify me.

                                     MILES
                         No way. No way.

                                     JACK
                              (a pitiful whine)
                         Please, Miles, please.

                                     MILES
                         Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at 
                         a bar. Happens every day.

               Jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as 
               he considers this. Then --

                                     JACK
                         No, we've got to get my wallet! Those 
                         rings are irreplaceable! We've got 
                         to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I 
                         know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up. 
                         You gotta help me. You gotta help 
                         me. Pleeeease!

               Jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation 
               that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else 
               for that matter.

                                     JACK
                         Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know 
                         I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing. 
                         Help me, Miles. Just this one thing, 
                         this one last thing. I can't lose 
                         Christine. I can't. I'm nothing 
                         without her. Please, Miles, please... 
                         uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......

               No longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting 
               low, primitive sounds. Snot flows from beneath his bandaged 
               nose.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING

               Miles drives in the early-morning light. Jack is now subdued, 
               quieted by his pain and exhaustion.

                                     MILES
                         She tell you she was married?

                                     JACK
                         Yeah.

                                     MILES
                         So what the fuck were you thinking?

                                     JACK
                         Wasn't supposed to be back till six. 
                         Fucker rolls in at five.

                                     MILES
                         Cutting it a little close, don't you 
                         think?
                              (off Jack's silence)
                         So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, 
                         say.

                                     JACK
                         Horny as shit. Flopping around like 
                         a landed trout.

               EXT. LOW-RENT STREET - MORNING

               The Saab creeps around a corner.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING

               Jack scans the street.

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, this is the block. Just keep 
                         going...
                              (spotting an AMC Pacer)
                         Yeah! This is it. There's her car.

               Miles pulls over and cuts the engine.

                                     MILES
                         So what's the plan?

                                     JACK
                         The plan is... you go.

                                     MILES
                         Me?

                                     JACK
                         My ankle. Just go explain the 
                         situation.

                                     MILES
                              (sarcastic, clearing 
                              his throat)
                         Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend 
                         was the one balling your wife a couple 
                         hours ago, and he seems to have left 
                         his wallet behind, and we were 
                         wondering...

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like 
                         that.

               Miles gives Jack a withering look. Jack reaches for the DOOR 
               HANDLE.

                                     JACK
                         Fuck you. I'll get it myself.

                                     MILES
                              (grabbing Jack's shirt)
                         Hold on.

               EXT. CAMMI'S STREET - MORNING

               Miles crosses the street and approaches --

               EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Miles presses his ear against the front door. Nothing. Then 
               he notices --

               A SLIDING GLASS DOOR a few feet away, just barely cracked 
               open.

               MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and 
               pulls back the curtain to reveal --

               A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed 
               beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S.

               Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass 
               door, and creeps inside.

               INT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               A furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then 
               Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door 
               down a short HALLWAY.

               Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the 
               floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom 
               grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a 
               MAN'S VOICE.

               IN THE HALLWAY --

               Miles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way 
               through a trail of shoes and clothes.

               Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct --

                                     MAN
                         You don't think I fuck you, bitch? 
                         I'll fuck you.

                                     CAMMI
                         I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

               Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see --

               INT. CAMMI'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Cammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams 
               away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL 
               PRESS CONFERENCE.

                                     MAN
                         You picked him up and you fucked 
                         him, didn't you, bitch?

                                     CAMMI
                         I picked him up and I fucked him. 
                         I'm a bad girl.

                                     MAN
                         And you liked fucking him, didn't 
                         you, you fat little whore?

                                     CAMMI
                         I liked it when you caught me fucking 
                         him.

               Whoa!

               Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature 
               documentary and scan the room.

               IRIS IN --

               to the WALLET atop the dresser.

               Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the 
               wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles 
               to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and 
               tears out. Behind him he hears -- 

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         The fuck was that?

                                     CAMMI (O.S.)
                         The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!

               EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed 
               swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's 
               fast for a man his size.

                                     CAMMI (O.S.)
                         Get him!

               INT. SAAB - MORNING

               Jack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the 
               radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news.

               THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW --

               Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's 
               naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks 
               loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake.

                                     MILES
                         Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn 
                         door!

               Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get 
               in before --

               WHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the 
               roof before trying the door, now re-locked.

                                     MAN
                         You motherfuckers! I'll kill you! 
                         I'll kill you motherfuckers!

               Miles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries 
               to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns 
               to look --

               OUT THE BACK WINDOW --

               The guy recedes in the distance.

               JACK

               removes the rings from the wallet.

                                     JACK
                         You did it! You fucking did it!

               They LAUGH and SLAP HANDS.

               CLOSE ON MILES --

               For all his failures, this time he did something right.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               The shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring 
               loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his 
               bags for departure.

               At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep.

               A KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his 
               hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will 
               know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya.

               He opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART.

                                     MAID
                         Housekeeping.

               OMIT.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               The Saab enters the freeway and heads south.

               INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

               Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, WATCHING THE 
               LANDSCAPE CHANGE as they leave wine country.

                                     MILES
                         Hey, Jack. Jack.

                                     JACK
                         Hrnrnrn?

                                     MILES
                         That was quite a day yesterday.

               Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile.

                                     JACK
                         Yep. Quite a day.

                                     MILES
                         Quite a week.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               A driving shot.

               EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY

               Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs. 
               As Miles puts the nozzle back in place --

                                     JACK
                         Want me to drive?

                                     MILES
                         No, I'm okay.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, why don't you invite Maya to 
                         the wedding?

                                     MILES
                         Somehow I don't think inviting Maya 
                         to your wedding is the right move. 
                         In fact, after your bullshit, it's 
                         going to be hard for me to even go 
                         to the Hitching Post again.

                                     JACK
                         You're so negative.

               Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap.

                                     JACK
                         Come on, let me drive.

                                     MILES
                         I'm fine. You rest.

                                     JACK
                         I feel like driving.

               INT. SAAB - DAY

               As the car makes its way back toward the freeway, Jack looks 
               over at Miles and slows the car to a stop.

                                     MILES
                         What's wrong?

                                     JACK
                         Nothing. Buckle up, okay?

               Miles obeys. Without hesitation, Jack accelerates and JUMPS 
               THE CURB, heading into --

               EXT. VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS

               The Saab plows INTO A TREE.

               INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

                                     MILES
                         What the fuck!

                                     JACK
                              (pointing at his face)
                         You said it looked like a car 
                         accident.

                                     MILES
                         What the fuck!

                                     JACK
                         I'll pay for it.

               EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY

               They get out to inspect the damage. The hood is slightly 
               crumpled, and the front fender is bent.

                                     MILES
                         Look at this!

                                     JACK
                         I don't know. Doesn't look like 
                         anybody got hurt in this one.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.

                                     JACK
                         You need a new car anyway.

               Miles looks at his friend, incredulous.

                                     JACK
                         I said I'd pay for it.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of 
               wine. Miles notices that one box is DRIPPING.

                                     MILES
                         You broke some.

                                     JACK
                         Whatever. Sorry.

                                     MILES
                         No, not whatever. You fucking 
                         derelict.

               MOMENTS LATER --

               Miles looks on as Jack hoists a FOUNDATION BLOCK toward the 
               open driver's door of the Saab.

                                     JACK
                         You ready?

               Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with."

               Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops 
               the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL.

               Direct hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in 
               time.

               Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the 
               tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the 
               car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, fuck!

               The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the 
               tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally 
               toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the 
               car remains visible.

               The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still 
               frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.

                                     JACK
                         It's okay. I've got Triple A.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               From in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and 
               FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing 
               together.

               EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY

               The Saab approaches the end of the line.

               EXT. ERGANIAN HOUSE --DAY

               AT THE FRONT PORCH --

               Miles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops 
               the last case down.

                                     MILES
                         Well. That about does it.

                                     JACK
                         Why don't you come in?

                                     MILES
                         Uh-uh. You're on your own.

                                     JACK
                         So I'll see you at the rehearsal.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah.

               They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug.

                                     JACK
                         Love you, man.

                                     MILES
                         Back at you.

               Miles heads toward the curb.

                                     JACK
                         Hey, don't pull away till they see 
                         the car.

                                     MILES
                              (over his shoulder)
                         Yeah.
                              (turning around)
                         Hey, why wasn't I injured?

                                     JACK
                              (big smile)
                         You were wearing your belt.

               BACK AT HIS CAR --

               Miles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs. 
               Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock 
               and dismay. Jack points back at --

               MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly 
               MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --

               JACK --

               weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants 
               to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the 
               door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to 
               get a better look.

               VERY CLOSE ON MILES --

               watching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he 
               momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is 
               interrupted by --

               THE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST

               Startled, Miles turns to look at --

               A PRIEST

               who is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS.

               We are now in --

               INT. ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH - DAY

               The church is packed.

               CLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft.

               If those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at 
               Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his 
               blessing.

               EXT. ARMENIAN CHURCH - DAY

               AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS --

               The WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING 
               LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as 
               the new groom.

               AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS --

               Miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then --

                                     VICTORIA (O.S.)
                         Hey, Miles.

               Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step 
               above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the 
               quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played 
               college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing 
               vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.

                                     MILES
                         Hi, Vicki.
                              (taking her in)
                         You look beautiful.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my 
                         husband.

               From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers 
               his hand.

                                     KEN
                         How are you?

                                     MILES
                         Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky 
                         guy.

                                     KEN
                         Thanks.
                              (to Victoria)
                         I'll wait for you at the car.
                              (to Miles)
                         Nice to meet you, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Ken.

               Exit Ken.

                                     MILES
                         That was big of him.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Yeah, he's good that way. Very 
                         considerate.

                                     MILES
                         That's great.

                                     VICTORIA
                         So how're you doing?

                                     MILES
                         Since the last time we spoke? I don't 
                         know. Could be better. Could be worse.

                                     VICTORIA
                         So what's happening with your book?

                                     MILES
                         Universally rejected. Strike three.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are 
                         you going to do?

                                     MILES
                         Back to the drawing board, I guess. 
                         Or not. So... you're married. 
                         Congratulations. You look happy.

                                     VICTORIA
                         I am.

                                     MILES
                         Seems like everyone's getting married. 
                         A year ago it was all divorces. Now 
                         it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.

                                     VICTORIA
                         I guess.

               Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the 
               curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the 
               sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives 
               Ken a little wave.

                                     MILES
                              (shifting gears)
                         Well, let's go have some champagne, 
                         shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.

                                     VICTORIA
                         Not me. I'm not drinking.

                                     MILES
                         You quit drinking?

                                     VICTORIA
                         I'm pregnant.

                                     MILES
                              (hit in the solar 
                              plexus)
                         Oh. Huh. Well...
                              (rallying)
                         Congratulations again, Vicki. That's 
                         wonderful news.

                                     VICTORIA
                              (going to the car)
                         See you over there, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Yeah.

               As she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back 
               at --

               THE RECEIVING LINE

               -- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old 
               FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law, 
               and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               A HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated 
               with balloons, reads: "RECEPTION THIS WAY!" with an arrow 
               pointing RIGHT.

               One by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn 
               comes, Miles turns LEFT.

               EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               The Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he 
               sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car, 
               this time carrying SOMETHING.

               OMIT

               INT. FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY

               His bowtie undone, Miles sits at a booth eating. He washes 
               down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated 
               soft drink cup.

               He brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a BOTTLE OF 
               WINE hidden next to him. As he sets the bottle back down, we 
               glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc.

               He takes another sip. As the camera MOVES CLOSER, all the 
               complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's 
               face.

                                     14-YEAR-OLD BOY (O.S.)
                         "The marrow of his bone," I repeated 
                         aimlessly. This at least penetrated 
                         my mind. Phineas had died from the 
                         marrow of his bone flowing down his 
                         blood stream to his heart.

               INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

               The voice belongs to one of Miles's PUPILS reading aloud in 
               class. Other students follow along silently from their own 
               copies of A Separate Peace.

               SUPERIMPOSED --

                                     FIVE WEEKS LATER

               Miles sits behind his desk at the front of the class.

                                     14-YEAR-OLD BOY
                         I did not cry then or ever about 
                         Finny. I did not cry even when I 
                         stood watching him being lowered 
                         into his family's straight-laced 
                         burial ground outside of Boston. I 
                         could not escape a feeling that this 
                         was my own funeral, and you do not 
                         cry in that case.

               The students look up.

                                     14-YEAR-OLD BOY
                         Do you want me to keep reading the 
                         next chapter, Mr. Raymond?

                                     MILES
                              (as though coming to)
                         Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on 
                         Monday.

               INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               Miles enters his tiny apartment. He loosens his tie and puts 
               down his satchel.

               On his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his 
               ANSWERING MACHINE. As it plays, he opens the REFRIGERATOR 
               and looks inside.

                         Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

               Miles FREEZES, not wanting to miss a single syllable.

                         Thanks for your letter. I would have 
                         called you sooner, but I think I've 
                         needed some time to think about 
                         everything that happened and what 
                         you wrote to me. Another reason I 
                         didn't call sooner is that I wanted 
                         to finish your book, which I finally 
                         did last night.

               Miles's heart pounds.

                                     MAYA'S VOICE
                         I think it's really lovely, Miles. 
                         You're so good with words. Who cares 
                         if it's not getting published? There 
                         are so many beautiful and painful 
                         things about it. Did you really go 
                         through all that? It must have been 
                         awfully hard. And the sister character --
                         Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to 
                         say I was really confused by the 
                         ending. Did the father finally commit 
                         suicide, or what? It's driving me 
                         crazy. And the title.

                         Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy 
                         here lately. But I like winter. So 
                         listen, if you ever do decide to 
                         come up here again, you should let 
                         me know. I would say stop by the 
                         Hitching Post, but to tell you the 
                         truth I'm not sure how much longer 
                         I'm going to be working there. I'm 
                         going to graduate soon so I'll 
                         probably relocate. We'll see.

               Miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches Maya's back 
               door.

                         Anyway, like I said, I really loved 
                         your novel. Don't give up, Miles. 
                         Keep writing. You're really good. 
                         Hope you're well. Bye.

               Miles takes a breath. Finally he KNOCKS.

               FADE OUT.

                          PAT
           I lost all that. I blew it. But you
           also blew it. We can get it back.
           We're gonna get it back. It's all
           gonna be better now. I'm better now
           and I hope you are, too. And I'm

           okay?

           And it was just the way I wanted
           it, but he cut it back too far. He
           cut this side back too far trying
           to even it up. I didn't tell him to
           do that. I said, "Just cut it the
           way you cut it...."

                          PAT
           Once you get in the right frame of
           mind, I think anything's possible.
           I think we get, we so often get
           caught in this state of negativity

           Bad combination.

                          PAT
           Yeah. On top of an anxiety
           disorder.

                          DANNY
           That was when I was an X-ray
           technician with my ADD and my
           anxiety. I had a lot of access to
           medication and I took advantage of
           it. That's when my hair was long,
           too. But my hair only grew when I
           was older. When I was younger, my
           hair didn't grow because my
           brother...

                          (TO PAT)
           Remember I told you about my
           brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I
           couldn't get a Jheri curl because
           my hair didn't grow long enough. I
           was so jealous of my brother...

           PAT SR.
           It's insanity. He spikes the ball
           at the one yard line. The one-
           fucking-yard line. I mean, get into
           the end zone, dummy. I mean, he
           celebrates before he's even in!

                          RANDY
           You know something? It's nothing

           PAT SR.
           Wait a minute, what are you talking
           about? What makes the Cowboys
           America's Team?

                          RANDY
           Because we are, we're America's
           Team.

           PAT SR.
           You should be ashamed of yourself.
           We're in Philadelphia, what's the
           matter with you? You're a fucking
           traitor.

                          RANDY
           What's more American than a cowboy?

           PAT SR.
           You know what's more American?

                          RANDY
           What?

           PAT SR.
           Benjamin Franklin, that's what's
           more American.

                          RANDY
           Benjamin Franklin?

           I wanna make sure when you come out
           that you're okay, and she didn't
           say anything. (to Dolores) You
           didn't tell me?

           Don't worry.

                          PAT
           Dad, I'm in there because of the
           court. That's the agreement that we
           made months ago. It was a plea
           bargain with the courts. The
           lawyer, he instructed me, he said
           that what we should plead that, and
           then I would serve eight months and
           then I'd get out.

           PAT SR.
           Yeah, no, I just--

                          DOLORES
           It's all under control.

          Who told you that?

                          PAT
          Mom told me. Outside.

                          DOLORES
          I did not. No, I didn't.

                          PAT
          You just told me outside, Mom, what
          are you talking about? Five minutes
          ago, we were walking up the stairs,
          you said, "Don't say anything, but
          Dad lost his job and he's
          bookmaking."

           PAT SR.
          Why, Dolores? Why did you say that
          to him? He has the wrong idea.

                          (TO PAT)
          Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm
          more concerned about you than
          anything else.

                          PAT
          Good, Dad. Good.

           PAT SR.
          Okay, the question, the big
          question, is what are you gonna do
          with yourself?

                          PAT
          What am I gonna do? I'm getting in
          shape, I'm getting trim, I'm
          getting really fit for Nikki. I'm
          gonna read Nikki's teaching
          syllabus and get my old job back.

           PAT SR.
          Nikki sold the house. She left.
          Didn't your mother tell you that?

                          PAT
          Let me tell you something. You
          don't know anything about my
          marriage, okay, Dad? All right? Our
          marriage...we're very, very much in
          love, okay? Just like you two.

           PAT SR.
          Listen, Patrick, she's gone. She's
          not around anymore. Nikki left.

           14.

                         

                          PAT
           What are you doing, Dad? You know
           what? Excelsior. Excelsior.

           PAT SR.
           What does that mean?

                          PAT
           It means you know what I'm gonna
           do, I'm gonna take all this
           negativity and use it as fuel and
           I'm gonna find a silver lining,
           that's what I'm gonna do. And
           that's no bullshit. That's no
           bullshit. That takes work and
           that's the truth.

                          PAT
           Yeah, about a week before the

           told them that my wife and the
           history guy were plotting against
           me by embezzling money from the
           local high school, which wasn't
           true. It was a delusion. And we
           later found out from the hospital
           that's because I'm, uh...

           ...undiagnosed bipolar.

           thinking brought on by severe
           stress, which rarely happens, thank
           God. And then the shower incident
           happened and that's when everything
           snapped, so I then realized that,
           oh, wow, I've been dealing with
           this my whole life. And without any
           supervision I've been doing it all
           on my own with no help and
           basically I've been white-knuckling

           I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the

           control, you know, she had the
           baby. I'm really glad you're back.
           I missed you. I really need someone

           you're wrong because why would she

           or to the hospital? Hmm? So take
           your medication and if you do fine,

           Pat, there's a possibility, and I
           want you to be prepared for it,
           that she may not return. True love
           is about letting her go and seeing
           if she returns. In the meantime, if
           you listen to that song, I don't
           want you to fall apart. So get a
           strategy, okay? You need one.

                          PAT
           Let me say something, I gotta say
           something.

           DR. PATEL
           Okay.

                          PAT
           This is what I believe to be true.
           This is what I learned in the
           hospital. You have to do everything
           you can, you have to work your
           hardest, and if you do, if you stay
           positive, you have a shot at a
           silver lining.

           DR. PATEL
           Work on a strategy, okay?

                          PAT
           Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this
           party on Sunday night and it's like
           a real hoity-toity thing and his
           wife, Veronica's a real stickler
           for.... I don't know, my mom got
           this Gap outfit she wants me to
           wear, but I wanna wear a jersey
           that my brother, Jake, got me from
           the Eagles.

           DR. PATEL
           Which jersey?

                          PAT
           DeSean Jackson.

           DR. PATEL
           DeSean Jackson is the man.

                          PAT
           Well, that settles that.

                          RONNIE
           Pat! What are you doin'?

          PAT STOPS AND TURNS.

                          PAT
           I gotta go, man.

                          RONNIE
           Why?

                          PAT
           I can't stay, come on. I made a
           mistake, I shouldn't have worn
           this.

                          RONNIE
           Dude, you're fine. I like that
           jersey. I wish I was wearing that
           jersey.

                          PAT
           I feel like an idiot.

                          RONNIE
           Are you comfortable?

                          PAT
           Veronica's not gonna like it.

                          RONNIE
           Get over here.

                          PAT
           Plus you got a tie on.

                          RONNIE
           Don't worry about it, you're the
           guest of honor. You come however
           you wanna come.

                          PAT
           Really?

                          RONNIE

           You mean rookie of the year?

                          RONNIE
           Yeah.

                          VERONICA

                          (TO BABY)
           DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson?
           (noticing Pat) Oh, you wore a
           jersey to dinner.

                          RONNIE
           Isn't it awesome?

                          VERONICA
           Not for dinner.

                          RONNIE
           Look, he got us flowers.

                          VERONICA
           Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's
           sweet, Pat. That's lovely.

                          RONNIE
           And wine.

          RONNE AND PAT HAVE A MOMENT. A FRAMED PHOTO OF RONNIE,

          VERONICA AND THE BABY ON THE WALL.

                          RONNIE
           Check this out. We just redid the
           whole thing.

                          PAT
           Wow!

          RONNIE LAUGHS.

          Tremendous. Tremendous.

                          RONNIE
          Isn't it great?

                          PAT
          Tremendous.

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of
          redoing it again.

                          PAT
          Why?

                          RONNIE
          Because.

                          PAT
          Gotta be making a lot of paper to
          do that.

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I
          can't complain.

                          PAT
          Isn't the market down, though?

                          RONNIE
          It is down, but you know, she wants
          more, so I'm giving her more, man.

                          PAT
          Hey, you know my dad lost his
          pension.

                          RONNIE
          I'm sorry, man.

                          PAT
          Yeah.

                          RONNIE
          A lot of people. My uncle, too.

                          PAT
          Really?

                          RONNIE
          Yeah, but you know what? No
          disrespect, it's not personal, but
          this is the time to strike.

           over, you flip it over and that's

          RONNIE GLANCES, LOOKING FOR VERONICA.

                          PAT
           You okay?

                          RONNIE

                          (WHISPERING)
           I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody.
           Listen to me. I feel like I'm
           getting crushed and--

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)
           Crushed by what?

                          RONNIE

                          (WHISPERING)
           Everything. The family, the baby,
           the job, the fucking dicks at work,
           and it's like, you know, like I'm
           trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches
           for his throat, mimicking trying to
           breath) you know, and, and, and I'm
           like...suffocating.

          RONNIE COVERS HIS FACE WITH ONE HAND.

                          PAT
           Holy shit.

                          RONNIE
           You can't be happy all the time.

                          PAT
           Who told you you can't be happy?

                          RONNIE
           It's all right. You just do your
           best, you have no choice.

                          PAT
           That's not true at all.

                          RONNIE
           You just can't.

           I hope you're okay with Veronica's
           sister coming over. You okay with
           that?

                          PAT
           Who?

                          RONNIE
           Veronica's sister.

           PAT AND RONNIE

           Tiffany.

                          PAT
           Tiffany and...Tommy?

                          RONNIE
           Yeah. Just Tiffany.

                          PAT
           What happened to Tommy?

                          RONNIE
           He died.

                          PAT
           Tommy died?

                          RONNIE
           Cops die.

                          PAT
           How'd he die?

                          RONNIE
           Please, don't bring it up.

                          PAT
           No, how did he die?

                          TIFFANY
           How did who die?

          PAT LOOKS UP TO SEE VERONICA'S SISTER TIFFANY ENTER: THEY
          LOCK EYES IMMEDIATELY. SHE IS TALL, STRIKING, INTENSE. She
          walks to Ronnie and Pat, who is unsure how to behave.

                          RONNIE
           Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my
           sister-in-law Tiffany.

                          PAT
           You look nice.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

                          PAT
           I'm not flirting with you.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, I didn't think you were.

                          PAT
           I just see that you made an effort
           and I'm gonna be better with my
           wife, I'm working on that. I wanna
           acknowledge her beauty. I never
           used to do that. I do that now.
           `Cause we're gonna be better than
           ever...Nikki. Just practicing.
           How'd Tommy die?

          TIFFANY IS STUNNED. RONNIE CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT PAT JUST SAID.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What about your job?

                          TIFFANY
           I just got fired, actually.

                          PAT
           Oh, really? How?

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that
           happen?

                          TIFFANY
           Does it really matter?

          TIFFANY AND PAT FACE EACH OTHER. VERONICA ENTERS IN BG.,

           Baby, how's it going?

                          RONNIE

           Oh, it's a television.

           It's a computer screen.

           Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.

                          TIFFANY
           ...it's a drawer at a morgue where
           they pull out dead bodies and shoot
           them with formaldehyde.

                          VERONICA
           Don't think so hard, don't think so
           hard.

           We have a port in every room. Gimme
           an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an
           iPod?

           Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't
           even have a phone. They won't let
           me make any calls. They think I'm
           gonna call Nikki.

           Don't worry about it. Don't focus
           on that.

                          PAT
           I would call Nikki.

           I'm actually gonna give you one of
           my iPods. I have an old one.

                          VERONICA
           Gimme your iPod.

          RONNIE HANDS AN IPOD TO VERONICA.

                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           Give it to me. Thank you, baby,
           thank you.

          VERONICA PLUGS THE IPOD INTO THE OUTLET.

                          TIFFANY
           Of all the rooms there are iPod
           ports in, I'm happy you brought us
           into the bathroom.

                          VERONICA
           Look, look, look.

           44.

                         

          MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY.

                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           I can play music for the baby in
           any room.

                          PAT
           Can you play "Ride the Lightning"
           by Metallica?

          VERONICA IS SPEECHLESS. RONNIE GRINS.

                         

          INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING


                          RONNIE
           Pat was a history sub at the high
           school, Tiffany. Ask him about any
           president, he knows 'em all.

                          PAT
           Here's a fun fact. You know where
           the term "OK" comes from?

                          VERONICA
           No. No, I don't.

                          RONNIE
           Where?

                          PAT
           Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth
           president of the United States of
           America, is from Kinderhook, New
           York...

                          VERONICA
           Oh.

                          PAT
           ...and he was part of a club, a
           men's club, called Old Kinderhook.
           And if you were cool, you were in
           the club, they'd say, "That guy's
           OK." `Cause he was in the Old
           Kinderhooks.

                          RONNIE
           Really?

                          PAT
           Yeah. Pretty cool, right?

                          RONNIE
           That's interesting.

           45.

                         

                          VERONICA
          You know, Tiffany's been doing this
          dance thing for years and she's
          real good at it. She's gonna be
          competing at the Ben Franklin
          Hotel.

                          PAT
          Oh, really? My wife loves dance.
          Nikki loves dance.

                          TIFFANY
          Why do you have to talk about me
          like that?

                          VERONICA
          I'm just bragging about you. Can't
          I brag about my little sister?

                          TIFFANY
          Don't talk about me in the third
          person.

                          VERONICA
          Please, gimme a break.

                          TIFFANY
          I'm right here.

                          VERONICA
          Just be nice. Just be nice.

                          PAT
          Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.

                          TIFFANY
          Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.

                          VERONICA
          I know. I know, I know.

                          TIFFANY

                          (TO PAT)
          What meds are you on?

                          PAT
          Me? None. I used to be on Lithium
          and Seroquel and Abilify, but I
          don't take them anymore, no. They
          make me foggy and they also make me
          bloated.

                          TIFFANY
          Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor,
          but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so
          I stopped.

           46.

                         

                          PAT
           You ever take Klonopin?

                          TIFFANY
           Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.

                          PAT
           Right?

                          TIFFANY
           Jesus.

                          PAT
           It's like, "What? What day is it?"
           How about Trazodone?

                          TIFFANY
           Trazodone!

                         TIFFANY LAUGHS

                          PAT
           Oh, it flattens you out. I mean,
           you are done. It takes the light
           right out of your eyes.

                          TIFFANY
           God, I bet it does.

          VERONICA AND RONNIE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. TIFFANY STANDS UP.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           I'm tired. I wanna go.

                          VERONICA
           No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we
           haven't even finished the salad
           yet, or the duck. I made the Fire
           and Ice cake.

                          TIFFANY
           I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you
           gonna walk me home or what?

                          PAT
           You mean me?

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me
           home?

                          PAT
           You have poor social skills. You
           have a problem.

           47.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           I have a problem? You say more
           inappropriate things than
           appropriate things. You scare
           people.

                          PAT
           I tell the truth. But you're mean.

                          TIFFANY
           What? I'm not telling the truth?
          Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.

                          RONNIE
           Um, maybe I should drive them home
           separately?

                          VERONICA
           You can drive them both home. Now.

                          TIFFANY
           Stop talking about me in third
           person.

                          VERONICA
           You can take Tiffany home first.

                          TIFFANY
           You love it when I have problems.
           You love it, Von, because then you
           can be the good one. Just say it.

                          VERONICA
           No...

          PAT STANDS UP.

                          VERONICA (CONT'D)
           ...I don't. I don't. I just wanted
           to have a nice, I just wanted to
           have a nice dinner.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, God.

                          VERONICA
           What is your problem?!

                          TIFFANY
           Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm
           tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come
           on, are you ready?
          Pat stands.

           48.

                         

                          VERONICA
           You really, you really wanna go
           right now?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, I really wanna go! It's been
           great.

                          RONNIE
           Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!

                          TIFFANY
           Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the
           baby. Bye.

          PAT FOLLOWS TIFFANY.

                          RONNIE
           Sorry, man.

          PAT GIVES RONNIE AN "ALL GOOD" AND FOLLOWS TIFFANY OUT.

                         

          EXT. STREET - EVENING


          PAT AND TIFFANY WALK TOGETHER IN SILENCE.

                          TIFFANY
           This is me.

          TIFFANY AND PAT STOP, FACE EACH OTHER.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Listen, I haven't dated since
           before my marriage so I don't
           really remember how this works.

                          PAT
           How what works?

                          TIFFANY
           I saw the way you were looking at
           me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it,
           don't lie. We're not liars like
           they are. I live in the addition
           around back, which is completely
           separate from my parents' house, so
           there's no chance of them walking
           in on us. I hate the fact that you
           wore a football jersey to dinner
           because I hate football, but you
           can fuck me if you turn the lights
           off, okay?

          PAT IS MOMENTARILY SPEECHLESS.

           49.

                         

                          PAT
           How old are you?

                          TIFFANY
           Old enough to have a marriage end
           and not wind up in a mental
           hospital.

                          PAT
           Look, I had a really good time
           tonight and I think you're really
           pretty, but I'm married, okay?

          PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, DISPLAYING HIS WEDDING RING.

                          TIFFANY
           You're married? So am I.

          TIFFANY HOLDS UP HER HAND, DISPLAYING HER WEDDING RING.

                          PAT
           No, that's confusing. He's dead.

          TIFFANY LOOKS AS IF SHE HAS BEEN PUNCHED, SHE EMBRACES PAT.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Wait, what?

          TIFFANY STARTS TO CRY.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What's happening?

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Oh, my God. Hey.

          TIFFANY PUSHES PAT AWAY AND SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS TO HER RENOVATED GARAGE APARTMENT.

          LED ZEPPELIN'S "WHAT IS AND WHAT SHALL NEVER BE" STARTS TO

          PLAY ON SOUNDTRACK.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/KITCHEN - EVENING


          PAT ENTERS THROUGH THE BACK OF THE HOUSE, DEEPLY UNSETTLED.

          HE WALKS PAST DELORES IN THE KITCHEN.

                          DOLORES
           Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey,
           is that make-up on your shirt?

                          PAT
           I don't know, Mom.

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING


          PAT IS WITH PAT SR. HE STANDS UP FROM HIS CHAIR.

           PAT SR.
           What happened over there?

          PAT BEELINES PAST PAT SR. TO THE STAIRCASE.

                          PAT
           When am I gonna get a phone?

           PAT SR.
           You'll get a phone in due time. (to
           Dolores) What happened?

          DOLORES ENTERS.

                          DOLORES
           Pat!

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - EVENING


          PAT REMOVES HIS JERSEY.
          LED ZEPPELIN CONTINUES alternately quiet and LOUD.

          PAT LIES ON HIS BED, RESTLESS. SUDDENLY HE IS FRANTICALLY

          SEARCHING THROUGH ATTIC BOXES AS IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT


          PAT WALKS OUT OF THE ATTIC. HE OPENS THE DOOR TO THE MASTER

          BEDROOM AND WALKS INTO THE ROOM. HE KNEELS DOWN NEXT TO

          DOLORES'S SIDE OF THE BED.

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)

                          (WHISPERING)
           I can't find my wedding video. Mom,
           wake up.

                          DOLORES

                          (WHISPERING)
           What is it?

                          PAT

                          (WHISPERING)
           Where's my wedding video?
          Led Zeppelin continues.

          PAT SR. WAKES, LOOKING AT THE ALARM CLOCK.

           PAT SR.
           It's after three o'clock! What are
           you doing?

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - NIGHT


          DOLORES AND PAT WALK INTO THE ATTIC.

                          PAT
           I looked in here, but this is all
           your sewing shit up here, for your
           sewing and everything. Did you put
           it up here?

          PAT STEPS TO AN OPEN CLOSET.

                          DOLORES
           What about in your father's study?

           (shouts from bed)
           Don't go in my study.

                          PAT

           Dad, not now!

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - NIGHT


          PAT'S HANDS AS HE RIFLES THROUGH STUFF ON THE CLOSET FLOOR.

                          PAT
           Would you put it in here? It makes
           no sense for you to put it in here.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT


          WE SEE PAT AS HE LOOKS INTO A CABINET OF VIDEOTAPED FOOTBALL

          GAMES.

                          PAT
           He's got all his Eagles videos and
           not one video of my wedding!

          PAT SEARCHES THROUGH THE VIDEOTAPES.

                          PAT (CONT'D)

           I like to run by myself, okay?

                          TIFFANY
           Me too.

                          PAT
           (stops and turns)
           Hey, I like to run alone! Will you
           stop?

                          TIFFANY
           What?

                          PAT
           Okay? I'm running here!

                          TIFFANY
           Me too!

                          PAT
           Well then, why don't you run
           somewhere else? There's a fucking
           ton of roads to run in! What are
           you trying to do?

                          TIFFANY
           I like this road. This is my
           neighborhood.

                          PAT

                          (SIGHS)
           Oh, come on, please!

                          TIFFANY
           Calm down, crazy.

          PAT SPITS. TIFFANY SPITS.

           62.

                         

          PAT TAKES OFF DOWN AN ALLEYWAY TO DITCH TIFFANY; HE DOES. AS

          PAT SLOWS TO A JOG AGAIN, MUTTERS TO HIMSELF, NOTICEABLY

          DISTURBED BY HIS ENCOUNTER WITH TIFFANY WHEN --

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Hey!

          TIFFANY REAPPEARS FROM ANOTHER ALLEY BEHIND PAT.

                         

                          PAT
           What the fuck?!

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I'm married!

                          TIFFANY
           So am I!

                          PAT
           What the fuck are you doing? Your
           husband's dead!

                          TIFFANY
           Where is your wife?

                          PAT
           You're crazy!

                          TIFFANY
           I'm not the one that just got out
           of that hospital in Baltimore.

                          PAT
           I'm not the big slut!

          TIFFANY STOPS AND REACTS, BENDING OVER. PAT STOPS AND WALKS.

                          PAT (CONT'D)

                          (BREATHES HEAVILY)
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

          TIFFANY STANDS UP.

                          TIFFANY
           I was a big slut, but I'm not
           anymore. There's always gonna be a
           part of me that's sloppy and dirty,
           but I like that, with all the other
           parts of myself. Can you say the
           same about yourself, fucker?! Can
           you forgive? Are you any good at
           that?

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS.

          INT. OFFICE/DR. PATEL'S OFFICE - DAY


           DR. PATEL
           You seemed to have trouble last
           night.

                          PAT
           Let me just set the record straight
           about last night. Hurting my mother
           was a mistake and I hate myself for
           it, and I hate my illness and I
           want to control it. My father, on
           the other hand, had no trouble
           slapping the shit out of me last
           night, which I did not return
           `cause I could've killed him and I
           didn't. He's sixty-five years old.
           You don't think I could've beat the
           shit out of him? I mean....

           DR. PATEL
           He was scared for your mother and
           you hurt him as well.

                          PAT
           Yes, last night was a mess. Okay?
           And I think he probably just tried
           to do his best.

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, you have to have a strategy. I
           told you earlier. You need to
           recognize these feelings coming to
           you, otherwise you will be sent
           back to Baltimore. So when you get
           these feelings, you need to get to
           a quieter place, and be at peace
           with yourself, however you can.

                          PAT
           Yeah, but that's easier said than
           done.

           DR. PATEL
           You have to do it. You have no
           choice. Excelsior.

                          PAT
           Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a
           letter I want you to give Nikki,
           okay?

           DR. PATEL
           No.

                          PAT
           Why?

           64.

                         

           DR. PATEL
          Because you have a restraining
          order.

                          PAT

                          (SIGHS)
          What good are you, man?

           DR. PATEL
          Why did you have this overwhelming
          urgency to see your wedding video
          last night?

                          PAT
          Oh, I don't know, because I'm
          married and I haven't seen my wife
          in eight and a half months?

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe you think that Nikki's not
          around and Tiffany's an attractive
          girl and if you get drawn towards
          Tiffany, you will spoil your
          chances of getting Nikki back to
          you?

                          PAT
          Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't
          think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki
          because Tiffany's a slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Why is she a slut?

                          PAT
          After the dinner at Ronnie's, she
          said, quote, "We can go to the back
          house and you can fuck me as long
          as we turn the lights out."
          Unquote. And she still wears her
          wedding ring. So she's a loyal,
          married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

           DR. PATEL
          Maybe she just needs a friend and
          she thought if she offers you sex,
          it will be easier for you to become
          friends with her.

                          PAT
          She said she's not a whore anymore,
          but she likes that part of herself
          along with all the other parts of
          herself and can I say the same?

           DR. PATEL
          Can you?

           65.

                         

                          PAT
           Is that....? You're asking me,
           you're really asking me that
           question?

           DR. PATEL
           Yes.

                          PAT
           With all my crazy sad shit? What,
           are you fucking nuts?

           DR. PATEL
           Pat, the silver lining thing is
           yours. I'm just giving back your
           words to you. This "crazy sad
           shit," as you call it, made you a
           happier, calmer person with a
           beautiful positive philosophy of
           going outdoors, working out, and
           reading books.

                          PAT
           No, not the books.

           DR. PATEL
           You said Nikki's friends with
           Ronnie, Veronica and Tiffany. So if
           you become friends with Tiffany,
           Nikki will think that you're a
           kind, generous, large-hearted
           person, who helps people in need,
           who is basically thriving. So if
           you help Tiffany, it will be good
           for you.

                          PAT
           How do you know when I run?

           66.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           I wanted to clarify something. I
           just want us to be friends.
           (Pat doesn't answer)
           Did you hear what I said?
           (Pat doesn't answer still)
           Why are you giving me such a hard
           time?

                          PAT
           No, I'm not giving you a hard time.

          PAT AND TIFFANY RUN ACROSS THE STREET TOWARD A SMALL DINER.

                          TIFFANY
           I don't know how to act with you
           when you do this shit.

           diner?

          TIFFANY IS MOMENTARILY TAKEN ABACK BY PAT'S PROPOSAL.

           Here you go.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

          PAT LOOKS AT THE MENU. THE WAITRESS STANDS, WAITING.

                          PAT
           I'm gonna have a bowl of your
           Raisin Bran.

          TIFFANY'S PERPLEXED.

                          TIFFANY
           Tea.

          THE WAITRESS TAKES THE MENUS FROM THEM AND WALKS AWAY.

                          WAITRESS

           You want to share this?

                          TIFFANY
           Why did you order Raisin Bran?

                          PAT
           Why did you order tea?

          SHE EATS CEREAL.

                          TIFFANY

                          (CHEWING)
           Because you ordered Raisin Bran.

                          PAT
           I ordered Raisin Bran because I
           didn't want there to be any
           mistaking this for a date.

                          TIFFANY

                          (CHEWING)
           It can still be a date if you order
           Raisin Bran.

                          PAT
           It's not a date. So how's your
           thing going -- your dancing thing?

                          TIFFANY
           It's good. How's your restraining
           order?

                          PAT
           I wouldn't actually call the
           restraining order "my thing," but
           getting back with Nikki is, and
           I've been doing pretty well. Except
           for a minor incident at the
           doctor's office.

                          TIFFANY
           And the so-called incident with the
           weights.

                          PAT
           Yeah. That was a thing with my
           parents. I wish I could just
           explain it all in a letter to Nikki
           because it was minor and I could
           just explain it and let her know
           that I'm actually not out of
           control and that I'm actually doing
           really well.

          TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT.

                          TIFFANY
           I can get a letter to Nikki. I see
           her sometimes with my sister.

          PAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING.

                          PAT
           It would be so amazing if you could
           get a letter to Nikki from me.

           69.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          I'd have to hide it from Veronica.
          She's not into breaking the law,
          which this letter would definitely
          be doing.

                          PAT
          But you would do it?

                          TIFFANY
          I'd have to be careful. I'm already
          on thin ice with my family, you
          should hear how I lost my job.

                          PAT
          How did you lose your job?

                          TIFFANY
          By...having sex with everybody in
          the office.

                          PAT
          Everybody?

                          TIFFANY
          I was very depressed after Tommy
          died. It was a lot of people.

                          PAT
          We don't have to talk about it.

                          TIFFANY
          Thanks.

                          PAT
          How many were there?

                          TIFFANY
          Eleven.

                          PAT
          Wow.

                          TIFFANY
          I know.

                          PAT
          I'm not gonna talk about it
          anymore.

                          TIFFANY
          Okay.

          Can I ask you one more question?
          Were there any women?

           70.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          Yes.

                          PAT
          Really?

                          TIFFANY
          Yes.

                          PAT
          What was that like?

                          TIFFANY
          Hot.

                          PAT
          Jesus Christ. Was it like...older
          women, a sexy teacher who wants to

                         SEDUCE YOU--

                          TIFFANY
          Made me sit on her lap and do
          things? Yeah.

                          PAT
          What? You sat on her lap?

                          TIFFANY
          Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
          She told you what to do?

                          TIFFANY
          Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
          Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I
          talked like this. Made me feel like
          such a pervert. Maybe we should
          change the subject.

                          TIFFANY
          I don't mind it.

                          PAT
          You don't, do you.

                          TIFFANY
          No. But then people were getting
          into fights in the parking lot at
          work, and in the bathroom...and the
          boss called me in to his office and
          tried to pin it all on me. So I
          accused him of harassment and then
          they fired me, sent me home and put
          me on some meds.

           71.

                         

                          PAT
           I get it. The song that was playing
           when my wife...was in the shower
           with the history teacher...

                          TIFFANY
           I heard about that.

                          PAT
           ...it was my wedding song and when
           I hear it, I go kinda crazy.
           Sometimes I hear it when it's not
           even playing.

                          TIFFANY
           Wow.

                          PAT
           Yeah. So they put me on medication,
           which I feel ashamed of.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah.

                          PAT
           So I know.

                          TIFFANY
           You do.

                          PAT
           I just gotta get a strategy, you
           know?

                          TIFFANY
           Me too.

                          PAT
           We'd better get back to the letter.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, let's get back to the letter.

                          PAT
           What if you told Nikki when
           Veronica was in the bathroom?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes. Yes, that could work. I love
           that.

                          PAT
           Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and
           write the letter right now.

          PAT BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT OF THE BOOTH.

           72.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          Can I at least finish my tea?

                          PAT
          Wait, what?

                          TIFFANY
          My tea. Can I finish it?

                          PAT
          Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell
          Nikki about our dinner? Why would
          she do that? Was it a test?

                          TIFFANY
          I kinda got that feeling, yeah.

                          PAT
          Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a
          test. How did I do? I think I did
          pretty well.

                          TIFFANY
          Yeah, she said you were cool,
          basically.

                          PAT
          "Basically"? Was I some percentage
          not cool?

                          TIFFANY
          No, she said you were cool, but you
          know.

                          PAT
          No, I don't know.

                          TIFFANY
          Sort of how you are. It's fine,
          relax.

                          PAT
          What do you mean? How am I? What
          does that mean?

                          TIFFANY
          Sort of like me.

                          PAT
          "Sort of like you"? I hope to God
          she didn't tell Nikki that.

                          TIFFANY
          Why?

           73.

                         

                          PAT
           Because, it's just not right,
           lumping you and I together, I mean,
           it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't
           like that. Especially after all the
           shit you just told me.

                          TIFFANY
           You think that I'm crazier than
           you.

                          (SCOFFS) (CHUCKLING)

                          MEAN--

           Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me.
           You know what? Forget I offered to
           help you. Forget the entire fucking
           idea. `Cause that must have been
           fucking crazy because I am so much
           crazier than you.

                          PAT
           Keep your voice down.

                          TIFFANY
           I'm just the crazy slut with a dead
           husband!

           Hey, come on. Look, I don't think
           you're crazy, all right?

          PAT HURRIES TO TIFFANY.

                          PAT
           Can I just explain myself, please?
           I didn't want Nikki to think that I
           was associated with that kind of
           sexual behavior because I've never
           done anything like that, okay?

                          TIFFANY
           You may not have experienced the
           shit that I did. But you loved
           hearing about it, didn't you? You
           are afraid to be alive, you're
           afraid to live. You're a hypocrite.
           You're a conformist. You're a liar.
           I opened up to you and you judged
           me. You are an asshole. You are an
           asshole!

          TIFFANY GRABS PAT'S JACKET COLLAR.

           OFFICER KEOGH (CONT'D)
           Are you being a punk on Halloween
           with these kids? You wanna go back
           to Baltimore? Is that what you
           wanna do?

           I didn't, I didn't, I didn't--
          TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens.

                          TIFFANY
           It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and
           Officer Keogh]. He didn't do
           anything, it was all the kids.
          Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           (walks crowd back)
           Let's go, clear out, nothing going
           on here.

          AS -- TIFFANY LEANS IN CLOSE TO PAT WHO IS UPSET, SONG
          PLAYING IN HIS HEAD. Tormented.

                          TIFFANY
           You gonna go your whole life scared
           of that song? It's just a song.
           Don't make it a monster.
          She leans close to Pat's downcast face.

           77.

                         

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           There's no song playing. There's
           no song. Breathe, count backwards
           from ten. That's it.
          Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops.
          Tiffany's face stays close to his.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's it. There you go. I'm sorry.
           I'm sorry.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry.

                          TIFFANY
           I took it too far.

                          PAT
           I'm sorry.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           (pulls her away)
           Hey, is he messing with you?

                          TIFFANY
           No, no. No, this was just a joke.
           This is a joke I started.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           There's a restraining order on this
           guy.

                          TIFFANY
           I know, I have a stupid sense of
           humor.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           That's not a good thing to do.

                          TIFFANY
           Well, I'm fucked up. What can I
           tell you? I'm sorry.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           You're Tommy's widow, right?

                          TIFFANY
           Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow,
           minus the whore thing for the most
           part.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           You're a funny girl. You wanna get
           a drink sometime?

          TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS AWAY.

                          PAT
           She doesn't, she doesn't do that
           anymore.

           I'm sorry about what I said in the

           I'll bet I know what happened if
           only one is missing. Either Dolores
           or Pat needed an envelope and one
           of `em took it. That's the only
           answer.

           PAT SR.
           No, no, no.

          DOLORES, PREPARING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Dolores, somebody was in my study.
           Who took one of my envelopes?
           Somebody took an envelope.

                          DOLORES
           Maybe we should call the FBI.

           PAT SR.
           Don't make fun. This is serious.
           What FBI? Come on, let's take a
           look. I'll show you what this is.
           I'm gonna just explain to you
           something. I mean, you know what
           I'm doing, honey. This everything,

           Dad, I borrowed one of your

           No, it's not okay. It's not okay.

                          (TO PAT)
          Listen, a lot of envelopes go in
          and out of my office every day
          after games with a lot of cash in
          `em. So show some respect for what
          I do.

                          PAT
          Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four.

          But the envelope was empty. I'm
          sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't
          want to wake you, but I needed an
          envelope.

           PAT SR.
          You didn't want to wake me? (to
          Dolores and Randy) He didn't want
          to wake me. He doesn't have a
          problem complaining about Ernest
          fucking Hemingway. He doesn't have
          a problem asking for his wedding

           PAT SR.
          You're just up, up, up. I don't
          know what that is. Are you taking
          the proper dosage of your
          medication?

                          PAT
          Am I taking the right dose? Of
          course I am.

           PAT SR.
          Okay. Taking a little bit too many
          or something?

                          PAT
          No, if I was taking that, I'd be on

          Just stay with us. Stay for the

          A CAR PARKS AT THE CURB IN BG.

           --it's not because they got a
           broken wing, and they're hurt, and
           they're an easy target. And in this
           case, in this particular case, I
           think that wing is being fixed.

           way of that right now, okay?
           Because she's sensitive and she's
           smart, she's artistic. This is a
           great girl and you gotta be

           You can't do what?

                          TIFFANY
           I can't give the letter to Nikki.

           Tiffany, what are you talking

           give the letter to Nikki?

                          TIFFANY
           Because what am I getting in

           You said! You said if I wrote a

                          TIFFANY
           I know.

                          PAT
           That was the set-up.

                          TIFFANY
           Because I do this time after time
           after time, I do all this shit for
           other people and then I wake up
           and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!

                          PAT
           What are you talking about? You
           seem like you're a tough girl to
           me. Why don't you just do things on
           your own?

                          TIFFANY
           I always get myself in these
           fucking situations. I give
           everything to other people and
           nobody ever, I never -- I don't get
           what I want, okay? I'm not my
           sister.
          Pat takes this in.

                          PAT
           Alright, well, ask for you. What
           can I do for you?

           It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a,
           it's a dance thing.

                          PAT
           It's a dance thing, all right.

                          TIFFANY
           It's a competition thing at the
           Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy
           would never do it with me and I
           missed it every single year.

           I don't have a filter when I talk.

           Can we have one conversation
           without you reminding me that my
           goddamn husband is dead? My God.

                          PAT
           Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay,

           partner...and now I'm about to miss
           it for another year.

           What, your schedule is so busy?
           "Grapes of Wrath" and watching
           football with your dad?

           Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance
           with you.

                          TIFFANY
           All right, then I'm not giving her
           your fucking letter.

           Well, I already did do something

           WHAT DID YOU DO FOR ME?

           I took care of that jerkoff that
           was in front of your house.

                          TIFFANY
           What? Jordie?

                          PAT
           Let me ask you something. Do you
           call him when you're lonely?

          TIFFANY STOPS.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           That encourages him, Tiffany. You
           shouldn't do it.

                          TIFFANY
           Couldn't you say the same about you
           and Nikki?

           It's not at all like me and Nikki.
           What are you talking about? We're
           in love and we're married. It's
           completely different.

                          TIFFANY
           How are you in love? Tell me about
           that. The big Nikki love. Tell me
           about it, I wanna understand it.

                          PAT
           We have a very unconventional
           chemistry, it makes people feel
           awkward, but not me. She's the most
           beautiful woman I've ever been
           with.

                          TIFFANY
           Wow.

                          PAT
           It's electric between us, okay?
           Yeah, we wanna change each other,
           but that's normal, couples wanna do
           that, I want her to stop dressing
           like she dresses, I want her to
           stop acting so superior to me,
           okay? And she wanted me to lose
           weight and stop my mood swings,
           both of which I've done. I mean,
           people fight. Couples fight. We
           would fight, we wouldn't talk for a
           couple weeks. That's normal. She
           always wanted the best for me.
          Tiffany listens.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           She wanted me to be passionate and
           compassionate. And that's a good
           thing. You know? I just, look, I'm
           my best self today, and I think
           she's her best self today, and our
           love's gonna be fucking amazing.

                          TIFFANY
           It's gonna be amazing, and you're
           gonna be amazing, and she's gonna
           be amazing, and you're not gonna be
           that guy that's gonna take
           advantage of a situation without
           offering to do something back. So
           think about the dance thing.

           everybody's got it. Everybody's
           just not in touch with it.

           Oh, no.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           How you doing, Pat?

                          PAT
           Jesus.

           PAT SR.
           I guess his sixth sense forgot to
           tell him the cops were coming.

                          OFFICER KEOGH

                          (RE: DANNY)
           I'm taking him back to the
           hospital.

                          PAT
           What? No, no, he passed his thing,

           First of all, check with the latest
           legal development.

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           Well, we got a call that they did
           convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law
           admission status by the deadline of
           your sentence, so....

           PAT SR.

                          (TO KEOGH)
           Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles
           fan or are you not an Eagles fan?

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           I'm an Eagles fan.

           PAT SR.
           Well then, what's the problem? He's
           not goin' anywhere. Just let him
           finish the game, that's all. The
           handkerchief is working. We're
           killing the Seahawks, twenty-seven-
           ten. What's the matter with you?
           Let him stay, please!

                          OFFICER KEOGH
           I don't know what the hell you're
           talking about "the handkerchief".
           And I'm glad that the Seahawks are
           losing and we're winning, but I
           gotta take Danny McDaniels back to
           Baltimore, alright? He can contest
           his case from Baltimore.

          DANNY STANDS UP.

                          DANNY
           Not correct about the Mental
           Hygiene Law. You're not correct.

                          OFFICER KEOGH

          TIFFANY LEADS PAT INTO HER DANE STUDIO.

                          TIFFANY
           I used the insurance money to build
           this. I designed it. All the floors
           are hard oak. It has good bounce
           for dancers.

                          PAT
           Wow.

                          TIFFANY
           I'm not that great of a dancer, but
           who cares? It's therapy and it's
           fun. And the walls are good `cause
           I can play music really loud
           without anybody hearing.

                          PAT
           Where do you sleep?

          TIFFANY GESTURES AT A STAIRCASE.

                          TIFFANY
           Upstairs. It's a garage, I just
           renovated it. You know, I was
           thinking about putting a ballet
           barre here.

                          PAT
           When are you gonna give it to her?

                          TIFFANY
           What?

                          PAT
           The letter to Nikki.

          PAT HOLDS UP THE ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY
           Probably tonight.

                          PAT
           Really?

           98.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna
           see her tonight.

                          PAT
           Oh, I actually changed the first
           paragraph. I did this thing about
           Shakespeare and how it's very

                          ROMANTIC-

                          TIFFANY
           Mm-hmm.

                          PAT
           -and that maybe in the future if
           she wanted to go dancing, I can be
           able to do that because of all the

                          TRAINING THAT--

                          TIFFANY

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           No, that's good, that's really
           good.

                          PAT
           I assume you're a good teacher.

          TIFFANY'S HAND TAKES THE ENVELOPE FROM PAT.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah. I mean, I hope so.

                          PAT
           Maybe you can teach us both, you
           know what I mean?

          TIFFANY EXITS AND PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE STAIRCASE.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           And I also mentioned how generous
           it is, what I'm doing for you.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.

                          PAT
           You know, being of service.

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah.

                          PAT
           To your need.

                          TIFFANY
           Uh-huh.

           99.

                         

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           All right, let's start simple.
           Start at that corner, walk towards
           me. Walk across the room.
          Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.

                          PAT
           Can we do something else besides
           the dance deal?

                          TIFFANY
           Are you fucking kidding me?

                          PAT
           I'm good with a hammer. You want me
           to fix something?

                          TIFFANY
           A deal is a deal.

                          PAT
           I know. Okay. I was just suggesting
           that maybe there's a better
           scenario.

                          TIFFANY
           Why don't you walk towards me like
           I'm Nikki. And the only way to
           convey how much you've missed me is
           by your walk. By your slow walk.
           You can't talk.

                          PAT
           I'm not doing it.

                          TIFFANY
           Only walk. Do it.

                          PAT
           No. That's stupid.

                          TIFFANY
           No walk, no letter. Walk to me like
           I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm
           Nikki. Come on.

                          PAT
           (under his breath)
           You're not Nikki.

          PAT RELUCTANTLY WALKS.

                          TIFFANY
           Don't look up until you're halfway
           here.

          HIS HEAD DOWN.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's right.

          PAT WALKS TO HER.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Not yet.

          PAT AS HE STOPS FACE TO FACE WITH TIFFANY AND LOOKS HER IN

          THE EYES.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Yes. Do you feel that? That's
           emotion.

                          PAT
           I don't feel anything.

                          TIFFANY
           Has anybody ever told you how Tommy
           died?

                          PAT
           No.

                          TIFFANY
           We were married for three years and
           five days, and I loved him. But for
           the last couple months, I just
           wasn't into sex at all. It just
           felt like we were so different and
           I was depressed. Some of that is
           just me, some of it was he wanted
           me to have kids and I have a hard
           enough time taking care of myself.
           I don't think that makes me a
           criminal. Anyway one night after
           dinner, he drove to Victoria's
           Secret at King of Prussia Mall and
           got some lingerie to get something
           going. And on the way back, he
           stopped on 76 to help a guy with a
           flat tire and he got hit by a car
           and killed. And the Victoria's
           Secret box was still in the front
           seat. (pause) That's a feeling.

          PAT, VISIBLY UPSET, WATCHES AS TIFFANY TURNS TO HER IPOD. BOB

           Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna
           teach you the waltz step.

          TIFFANY POSITIONS PAT AND GESTURES FOR HIM TO DANCE. HE MOVES

           What? You're not gonna read that
           shit on my time. I can tell you all
           about the "Lord of the Flies." It's
           a bunch of boys on an island and
           they have a conch -- they have a
           shell -- and whoever has the conch
           has the power and they can talk.
           And if you don't have the conch,
           then you don't have the power. And
           then there's a little chubby boy,
           and they call him Piggy and they're
           really mean, and then there's a
           murder. I mean, humanity is just
           nasty and there's no silver lining.

                          PAT
           Wow. That was a great synopsis. I
           still need to read it, though.

           104.

                         

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What the....? (laughing) What are
           you doing here, man?

          DANNY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.

                          DANNY
           If one of your two supervising
           physicians loses their license,
           then your whole ajudication is
           thrown out.

                          PAT
           How'd you know we were here?

                          DANNY
           I went by your parents' house
           looking for you and they told me
           you was over here.

                          PAT
           Danny, this is Tiffany. (to
           Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.

                          TIFFANY
           Hello. Pat told me about you.

                          DANNY
           So is the girl, that you wrote
           about?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

                          TIFFANY
           What? He wrote about me? I'm "the
           girl"?

                          DANNY
           He wrote about you, all right.

                          TIFFANY
           What'd he say?

                          DANNY
           He said you guys was helping each
           other out and you were nice and had
           a mouth on you, that you were
           mouthy, but--

                          PAT
           Whoa, whoa, that's enough.

                          TIFFANY
           No, please, tell me more about what
           he said in the letter.

           105.

                         

                          PAT
           Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll
           just tell you. It was nothing. It
           was just a very general letter.

                          TIFFANY
           Cool.

                          DANNY
           (looks at Tiffany)
           She's fine.

                          PAT
           She is my friend with an "F."

                          DANNY
           A capital "F."

                          PAT
           For "friend."
          The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.

                          DANNY
           Hey, can I see what you guys are
           doing?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

                          TIFFANY
           Okay.

          SHE TURNS ON MUSIC: PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE SIDE BY SIDE.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           And then this goes into something
           else.

                          DANNY
           That's it?

                          PAT
           Why? What is it, what is it, what
           is it.

                          DANNY
           Can I say something? Do you mind?

                          TIFFANY
           No.

                          DANNY
           You sure?

                          PAT
           Just say it. Say it.

           106.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           No, please.

                          DANNY
           I think Pat, you should be facing
           Tiffany.

          DANNY STEPS TO PAT AND TIFFANY, REMOVING HIS JACKET.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Let me show you, Pat, let me show
           you what I mean. You gotta come at
           her with a little bit more soul,
           man.

          HE HANDS HIS JACKET TO PAT AND FACES TIFFANY.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO TIFFANY)
           You should move more hips.

          TIFFANY AND DANNY. PAT WATCHES, STANDING BEHIND DANNY.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (TO PAT)
           Just, just sort of come in, Pat,
           come in like this. And....

          DANNY DANCES, DEMONSTRATING.

                          PAT
           Okay.

                          DANNY
           Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit
           more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a
           bit more.

          PAST DANNY, TO TIFFANY AS SHE DANCES. TIFFANY CHUCKLES

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           You could turn around, too, there's
           nothing wrong with that. Yeah.
           You're pretty good.

          TIFFANY, DANNY AND PAT AS THEY DANCE. ONE HAND ON HER WAIST.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)

                          (HUMS)
           Mm, yeah.

          PAT ENTERS, STEPPING BETWEEN DANNY AND TIFFANY.

                          PAT
           Okay, we got it, we got it.

           107.

                         

                          DANNY
           Okay. Okay.

          DANNY MOVES, EXITING. AS PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit
           more soul. Black it up, Pat.

                          PAT
           "Black it up"?

                          DANNY
           You know damn well what it means.

          TIFFANY LAUGHS.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute,
           wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an
           idea.

          CAMERA MOVES IN ON DANNY. CAMERA TILTS UP OVER DANNY AND

          TIFFANY AS THEY JUMP UP REPEATEDLY, HOLDING HANDS AND MOVING

          IN A CIRCLE.

          PAT WATCHES AS DANNY AND TIFFANY JUMP TOGETHER.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Come get some, Pat. Come get some.

          PAT BEGINS JUMPING WITH TIFFANY. CUT TO: DANNY WITH TIFFANY

          AGAIN.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle
           back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta
           move your junk.

          TIFFANY'S HIPS AS SHE DANCES. DANNY DANCES WITH HER. MUSIC

          STOPS.

                          DANNY (CONT'D)
           I gotta get out of here. I gotta go
           see this girl, Tanya. She lives on
           this side of town.

                          PAT
           Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.

                          DANNY
           Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there,
           man. I want you guys to win!

                          TIFFANY
           Bye!

           108.

                         

                          DANNY
           Excelsior, Pat!

                          PAT
           Excelsior!

                          DANNY
           That's my man.

          DANNY EXITS.

          TIFFANY AND PAT SMILE.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/ATTIC - MORNING


          PAT, ASLEEP IN BED.

          PAT SR. WALKS INTO THE ATTIC. HE SITS DOWN ON THE BED NEXT TO

          PAT.

          PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S SHOULDER.

           PAT SR.
           Hey. Patty.

          PAT WAKES.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Pat.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Patty. Where have you been? Huh?

          PAT GROANS.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           We got a serious situation on our
           hands, you know that.
          Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           We gotta beat the Giants if we
           wanna have a chance of getting into
           the division, any chance of playing
           in the playoffs. Do you realize
           that?

                          PAT
           I didn't realize that.

           109.

                         

           PAT SR.
           Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I
           mean, I think it would be wise if
           we spent father-son time, reading
           about the Eagles, talking about
           them, just to strengthen the good
           luck thing that you're in.

                          PAT
           Okay.

           PAT SR.
           Yeah?

                          PAT
           Right.

           PAT SR.
           Hmm?

          PAT SR. LOOKS AWAY.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           I just wanted to, maybe I didn't,
           spend enough time with you growing
           up. I spent too much time with your
           brother. It might have made you
           feel worse about your behavior, but
           I didn't know anything, I didn't
           know how to handle it. I mean,
           that's what all this Eagles stuff
           is about. It's about us, spending
           time now. I wanna do everything I
           can to help you get back on your
           feet. That's the whole point. Yeah.
           I wish you'd watch these games with
           me so we could talk, we could get
           into things. (inhales) So would
           you, would you just come downstairs
           and talk to me and Randy now?

          PAT SR. TOUCHES PAT'S CHEEK. PAT, MOVED, NODS.

                         

          INT. SOLATANO HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING


          RANDY SITS AT THE TABLE, DRINKING COFFEE.

           PAT SR.
           Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

                          RANDY
           He's betting everything on the
           Giant game. Everything.

           110.

                         

                          RANDY (CONT'D)
           All the money that he needs for the
           restaurant, he's betting on the
           Giant game.

           PAT SR.
           Tell him why.

                          RANDY
           Because he believes in you.

                          PAT
           Is that true?

           PAT SR.
           I believe in you, Patty. I believe
           in you. I want you to know that. So
           I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

          DOLORES STARES INTENSELY AT PAT.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           You understand?

                          PAT
           Yeah.

           PAT SR.
           Heavy. I want you to go to the game
           with your brother.

                          PAT
           You want me to go to the game with
           Jake?

           PAT SR.
           Of course I do.

                          JAKE
           Does he want me to go?

           PAT SR.
           Of course he wants you to go.

                          PAT
           He told you that?

           PAT SR.
           He told me, yes.

                          PAT
           Even with all his friends?

           PAT SR.
           With all his friends. He trusts
           you.

           111.

                         

                          PAT
           He's not embarrassed?

           PAT SR.
           No. I'd love to go to the game,
           too, but as you know, I'm banned
           from the stadium. `Cause I'd love
           to see us beat the Giants and take
           a lot of money from this asshole.

                          RANDY
           Listen, personally, I think it's a
           stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I
           think it's ridiculous to bet all
           that dough for the restaurant on a
           game.

           PAT SR.
           Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you
           heard what I said. It's like a
           family business, it's our family
           endeavor. We all stick together on
           this. That's how it works. That's a
           positive, positive vibe.

                          PAT
           I made a commitment to Tiffany
           about a project, and we have a very
           important part of it that we have
           to go over on Sunday, and it's good
           for me, Dad. It's making me
           disciplined and focused, and it's,
           it's--, I never would've thought
           this, but it's a good thing.

           PAT SR.
           What is this thing you're doing?

                          DOLORES
           Yeah, what is it? What is this
           project, hon?

                          PAT
           It's a dance thing, okay? There's
           nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.

          DOLORES STEPS TO PAT, KISSES HIS FOREHEAD.

                         

          INT. TIFFANY'S GARAGE/DANCE STUDIO - DAY


          TIFFANY AND PAT.

                          PAT
           Listen, I need to ask you
           something.

                          (MORE)

           112.

                         

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           Tomorrow can I spend half the day
           with you and half the day at the
           Eagles game?

                          TIFFANY
           I'm gonna pretend that you didn't
           just ask me that.

                          PAT
           Why?

                          TIFFANY
           These are the two days that you
           have promised me and that we have
           prepared to nail the big move. It's
           not ready yet. And we don't have a
           move yet.

                          PAT
           I know, but my dad opened up to me
           and it was really beautiful and I
           wanna be of service to him, okay?
           And he's worried that the juju from
           the Eagles is being fucked up and
           he's concerned that it's because
           I'm spending time with you.

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?

                          PAT
           No, you're not messing up the juju,
           but the juju is messed up because
           I'm not with him during the games.

                          TIFFANY
           Guess what?

                          PAT
           What?

                          TIFFANY
           Nikki replied to your letter.

          TIFFANY STEPS TO THE STAIRCASE, LIFTING AN ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           But you can't read it until after
           you nail the big move. Go.

          PAT SIGHS AS SHE TURNS SHARPLY, PLACES THE ENVELOPE ON THE

          STAIRCASE AGAIN. CUT TO:

          PAT BRACES HIMSELF AT FAR SIDE OF STUDIO TO CATCH TIFFANY'S

          BIG LEAP -- TIFFANY BRACES HERSELF TO RUN -- SHE RUNS --

          LEAPS -- THE FALL. THEY DO IT AGAIN, SAME RESULTS.

           113.

                         

                          PAT
           Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do
           anything else without reading
           Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--,
           it's in the back of my head. We
           don't almost have it, all right?

                          TIFFANY
           I just hope you can handle it.

                          PAT
           Thank you.

          TIFFANY PICKS UP THE ENVELOPE AND TURNS.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           What was her energy when she gave
           it to you?

                          TIFFANY
           She was intrigued, excited, and a
           little scared.

                          PAT
           She was scared? About what? Did she
           tell you?

          PAT TAKES THE ENVELOPE.

          CAMERA TILTS DOWN ONTO HIS HANDS, OPENING THE ENVELOPE.

                          TIFFANY
           Try to stay positive.

          PAT'S HANDS UNFOLD THE TYPED LETTER.

                          PAT
           I'm just gonna read it out loud,
           okay? Because if she says anything
           that's, you know, is that too much
           to ask?

                          TIFFANY
           No.

          PAT LOOKS DOWN AT THE LETTER, READING SILENTLY.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           I thought you were gonna read it
           out loud.

                          PAT
           Okay. Sorry.

                          (READING)

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           "Dear Pat, It was very emotional
           for me to get your letter, as I'm
           sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
           you took the risk of discreetly
           getting it to me through Tiffany.
           This gives us a chance to
           communicate while I keep the
           restraining order until I feel
           safe. I must admit you sound
           terrific and I'm happy that you are
           feeling so positive and becoming a
           more loving and caring man, which I
           always knew you were. I was moved
           to read about `Excelsior' and your
           belief in happy endings. I am also
           moved by your act of love to read
           the books I have taught at the high
           school. I'm sorry you find them so
           negative, but I disagree. I think
           they are great works of art that
           reflect how hard life can be and
           they can also help kids prepare
           themselves for the hardness of
           life. In spite of all these
           positive developments, Pat, I have
           to say if it's me reading the
           signs, I need to see something to
           prove you are ready to resume our
           marriage. Otherwise I find myself
           thinking that we might both be
           better off moving on with our lives
           separately. Please don't react
           quickly to this, but take time to
           think about it. I'm glad you're
           doing so well. Love, Nikki."
          PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I think I'm done for today, okay?

                          TIFFANY
           (follows him to door)
           She said to show her something,
           Pat. This dance can be that
           something. You would have never
           done something like this in a
           million years. It shows all kinds
           of skills on so many different
           levels: focus, collaboration,
           discipline. It's romantic, like I
           said it would be. It's for her.

                          PAT
           (over his shoulder)
           Thanks for the letter. I'll see you
           tomorrow, okay?

           What kind of emergency?

                          PAT
           Well, I'm just doing this project
           with Tiffany and I wanted to tell
           her I'm not gonna be on time.

           PAT SR.
           Just don't make her an emergency,
           that crazy girl, you know?

           She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow
           Jake's phone. It's too bad you
           can't come in to the stadium, but I
           know you were kicked out, you know,
           for beating everybody up. Guess
           we're not that different, huh, Dad?

           That a bad thing?

           You have to change. You're not
           gonna throw the marriage away.
           There's some kind of love there. I
           know, I used to see it.

           Dad.

          PAT. DR. PATEL, RONNIE AND JAKE STAND BEHIND HIM.

           PAT SR.
           The birds lose, I lose a fuckin'
           fortune, a fortune to Randy! What
           the fuck did you do?! You fucking
           lost it! I thought you said you had
           it together! You were solid!

                          PAT
           I am solid. I was solid at the
           game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid
           now.

           PAT SR.
           You fell apart! What are you
           fucking talking about?!

           DR. PATEL
           Your son was trying to--

           PAT SR.
           It's all fucking ruined now. It's
           all ruined.

                          PAT
           No, Dad!

          PAT SR. TURNS, REMOVING HIS JERSEY. PAT STEPS TOWARD HIM.

          PAT SR. AS HE STRUGGLES TO PULL HIS JERSEY OFF.

           PAT SR.

                          (YELLING)
           It's all fucking ruined now! It's
           all fucking ruined!

                          PAT
           No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!

           PAT SR.

                          (YELLING)
           It's all ruined, you little fucking
           shit!

           122.

                         

                          PAT
           No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking
           thing! Come on, Dad!

           PAT SR.

                          (YELLING)
           You loser! You loser!

          PAT SR. SHOVES PAT.

                          PAT

                          (EMOTIONAL)
           I'm not a loser.

           PAT SR.
           You fucking loser! You ruined
           everything!

           DR. PATEL
           He was defending his brother!

                         PAT CRIES

           PAT SR.
           You fucking idiot! You spike the
           ball on the one yard line, you
           fucking idiot!

          THE DOORBELL RINGS.

          DOLORES LOOKS AT THE FRONT DOOR.

          THE GROUP WATCHES AS TIFFANY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.

           PAT SR. (CONT'D)
           Who is this?! Who's this?!

          TIFFANY WALKS TO PAT.

                          TIFFANY
           We need to talk right now! When you
           make a serious commitment to
           somebody, it is not cool to not
           show up!

                          PAT
           Wait a second, I tried to call, my
           God, what's happening, I called--,
           but I tried to call you, Tiffany,

                          I--

           PAT SR.
           Who is this? What is this?

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, really?

           123.

                         

                          PAT
          Yes.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
          I told you I was gonna split my
          time with my dad and you, and my
          dad was pulling me in one
          direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--

                          TIFFANY
          Well, that sounds great, Pat.
          That's great for all of them, but
          all of them didn't make a
          commitment to me in return for my
          help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.

           PAT SR.
          What is this craziness with Tiffany
          Maxwell?

                          PAT
          There's no craziness. I told you
          who she was, I was doing this thing
          with her. We had a conversation!

           PAT SR.
          She's fucking nuts! When you
          started spending time with her, it
          all fell apart. This is the fucking
          reason right here.

                          TIFFANY
          You think I fucked up the Eagles'
          juju, don't you?

           PAT SR.
          Ever since, ever since he was with
          you, ever since--

                          TIFFANY

                          (INTERRUPTING)
          You think that I'm why today's
          happened?

           PAT SR.
          That's right, you are why today
          happened.

                          TIFFANY
          I'm the reason why today happened?

           PAT SR.
          I think so.

                          TIFFANY
          Let's talk about that.

           124.

                         

           PAT SR.
          Be my guest.

                          TIFFANY
          The first night that Pat and I met
          at my sister's, the Eagles beat the
          Forty Niners handily, forty to
          twenty-six. The second time we got
          together we went for a run and the
          Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to
          five in the NLCS.

                          JAKE
          She's right, Dad.

                          TIFFANY
          The next time we went for a run the
          Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty-
          seven to fourteen.

                          PAT
          Wow.

                          TIFFANY
          The third time we got together we
          had Raisin Bran in the diner and
          the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in
          the fourth game of the World
          Series, ten to two.

                          PAT
          Oh, wow.

           PAT SR.
          Let me think about that. Wait a
          minute.

                          TIFFANY
          Well, why don't you think about
          when the Eagles beat the Seahawks,
          fourteen to seven.

           PAT SR.
          He was with you?

                          TIFFANY
          He was with me. We went for a run.

                          RONNIE
          Really? That's crazy.

           125.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           There have been no games since Pat
           and I have been rehearsing every
           day and if Pat had been with me
           like he was supposed to, he
           wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he
           wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the
           Eagles beat the New York Giants.

                          JAKE
           She's making a lot of sense, Pop.
           That's all right on all counts.

                          TIFFANY
           Does anybody here happen to know
           what the official motto of the
           state of New York is on the
           official seal of the State of New
           York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do
           you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look
           it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."

                          DOLORES
           Oh Pat.

                          TIFFANY
           Not that I give a fuck about
           football or about your
           superstitions, but if it's me
           reading the signs, I don't send the
           Eagles guy whose personal motto is
           "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants
           game, especially when he's already
           in a legal situation.

                          RONNIE
           Unbelievable.

                          PAT
           Wow. How did you know all that
           stuff?

                          TIFFANY
           I did my research.

          SHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS.

           PAT SR.
           Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.

                          TIFFANY
           Thank you.

           PAT SR.
           I gotta rethink this whole thing. I
           didn't trust it before, but I gotta
           say, now I do.

           126.

                         

                          PAT
          Oh, now you like her, Dad?

           PAT SR.
          I have to say I do. Yup.

                          RANDY
          Patrizio, I feel terrible, you
          know? You made the bet, I won a lot
          of money, and now look, your whole
          family is in turmoil.

                          TIFFANY
          Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it.
          You live for this shit. You've been
          betting against my father for
          years.

                          PAT
          Is that right?

                          TIFFANY
          You're twisting the knife right
          now. You get off on it!

                          RANDY
          That's bullshit! That's not true!
          Don't say that!

                          TIFFANY
          You get off on it! If not, then
          prove it. Prove it.

           PAT SR.
          Yeah, prove it, prove it!

                          RANDY
          How do you want me to prove it?

           PAT SR.
          How's he gonna prove it?

                          TIFFANY
          By giving them the chance to win
          back everything, double or nothing.

                          PAT
          No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

                          RANDY
          Double or nothing on the Bengals,
          next week? Is that what you're
          saying?

                          TIFFANY
          No.

           127.

                         
          She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           Against the Cowboys.

          EVERYONE GASPS.

                          TIFFANY (CONT'D)
           That's your team isn't it, Randy?

                          PAT
           That's his team!

                          TIFFANY
           I know who his team is.

                          RANDY
           When is the game?

                          TIFFANY
           December twenty-eight, last game of
           the season.

                          PAT
           Oh, my God.

                          TIFFANY
           Same day as the Benjamin Franklin
           Pairs Open Freestyle Dance
           Competition.

                          DOLORES
           Oh God.

           PAT SR.
           Randy, I thought they were
           America's Team. Don't you believe
           in America's Team?

                          TIFFANY
           Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in
           America's Team?

                          RANDY
           Yeah, I believe in America's Team
           but if I win that bet, I win your
           book, you're out of action, you get
           no restaurant, no nothing.

           PAT SR.
           I like it.

                          DOLORES
           No. No, Patrizio--

           128.

                         

           PAT SR.
          I believe in the Eagles, I believe
          in my son, I'll take the action.
          I'll take it.

                          PAT
          Dad!

                          DOLORES
          Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!

           PAT SR.
          I have faith, I have faith.
          Excelsior belongs in this house--

                          PAT

                         DAD--

           PAT SR.
          --not in the State of New York. In
          this house.

                          PAT
          Dad, listen to me. I didn't know
          that "Excelsior" was the state
          motto of New York, okay?

           PAT SR.
          I didn't know, either, but now I
          know.

                          PAT
          I know, but listen to me, this is
          toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is
          toxic, you shouldn't be doing this,
          you shouldn't be doing--

           PAT SR.
          Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat)
          Be quiet, shut up. You already did
          enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do
          you say? My birds, Benjamin
          Franklin's team favored by one and
          a half points. I'll give you three
          more.

                          DOLORES
          Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't
          you take the bet!

           PAT SR.
          In fact, I'll give you ten points.

                          PAT
          No, Dad! Dad!

           129.

                         

                          JAKE
          Dad!

           PAT SR.
          You have to take that bet on the
          Cowboys.

                          RANDY
          Dolores, would you stop him?

                          JAKE
          Jesus!

           PAT SR.
          How could you not take that bet?
          Even with the ten points I give
          you, that's an insane spread to
          your advantage. Cowboys are
          cowards. And I'll bet you're such a
          coward, you won't take the ten.
          Plus, are you listening, plus
          whatever their score is at the
          dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's
          that? Tiffany, what's that?

                          PAT
          What? No, no, no, no.

                          RANDY
          You're crazy to give away that many
          points. That's ridiculous! I won't
          take that! However, wait a second.
          I do like the idea of a parlay.

                          DOLORES
          What? No parlay! No!

                          PAT
          No, don't do it. Don't do it.

                          RANDY
          Pat, how do they run this dance
          competition? I mean, how do they
          score it and everything?

                          PAT
          I don't know, I don't know how they
          fucking score! We're participating.
          We're not, we're not a part of it.
          There are people, this is a high-
          end dance contest. I don't know. Do
          not put it as part of the parlay,
          Randy. Don't--

           130.

                         

                          TIFFANY
           They go by the Philadelphia rules.
           Each dancer is scored on a scale of
           one to ten, ten being the highest.
           You have to average the four
           judges' scores.

                          RANDY
           Okay, score is from one to ten,
           right? And you guys are how good?

                          PAT
           We suck.

                          TIFFANY
           We don't suck. Pat's a beginner,
           I'm okay, we're happy just to be
           going there.

                          RANDY
           And how are the people you're
           competing against?

                          TIFFANY
           They're good. Some of them are
           professionals.

                          RANDY
           They're good? Better than you?
          Pause. Tiffany says nothing.

                          PAT
           A lot better.

                          RANDY
           A lot better. So if I was to say
           you only have to score five, I
           would be really very generous,
           right?

                          PAT
           No, no, that would be amazing if we
           got five. Let's not get away--

                          TIFFANY
           Oh, come on, we can get a five out
           of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a
           break!

                          PAT
           We can't get five!

           PAT SR.
           Give `em a five. Give `em a five.

           131.

                         

                          TIFFANY
          We can do a five.

                          PAT
          What are you talking about, Dad?
          You haven't even seen us dance!

                          RANDY
          That's the parlay.

           DR. PATEL
          Will somebody please explain to me
          the parlay? Please?

                          RONNIE
          You gotta win two bets or you lose
          the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to
          win, the birds gotta beat the
          Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta
          get at least a five at the dance.

           DR. PATEL
          That's very, very manic indeed.

                          RONNIE
          That's the parlay.

                          RANDY
          Shake on it.

                          PAT
          You know what? I'm not gonna be a
          part of this. (to Randy) Randy,
          Randy, you're a sickness. You're a
          fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.

                          TIFFANY
          Pat, you can't quit.

                          PAT
          I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.

                          TIFFANY
          Pat, calm down. Thank about it.

                          PAT
          See you later.

                          TIFFANY

           Here we are again at the one yard

           the jaws of victory. There you go.

                          PAT
           What does that even mean, Dad? I'm
           not gonna make that, that, that
           connection that you're making with
           DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter
           anymore okay? Just because I have
           the fucking jersey on...I'm not
           gonna do it. I'm sorry.

                          TIFFANY
           You are not a stand up guy right
           now. If it's me reading the
           signs...if it's me reading the

           You took that stupid parlay thing,
           and now he won't do the dance and
           it was very constructive for him,
           and you ruined it.

                          TIFFANY
           There's only one way to get him to
           show.

           PAT SR.
           What's that?

           We have to tell him that she's
           coming.

           PAT SR.
           We have to tell him that she's
           going.

                          DOLORES
           But that's a lie!

           It's a white lie.

           134.

                         

           PAT SR.
           It's a white lie, what's that
           matter? That's no big deal. So it's
           a little lie.

                          TIFFANY
           There's no other way.

           PAT SR.
           You know, we gotta leave a trail of
           bread crumbs so that he can live
           his life without ruining it.

                          DOLORES
           No. I don't approve. You can't do
           it.

           PAT SR.
           Well, you know, I didn't approve
           when you called her and you told
           her where he was running, so she
           could ambush him. I didn't approve
           of that, but you did it anyway, so
           I'm doing this anyway. That's it.

                          TIFFANY
           We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be
           there.

           PAT SR.

                          (TO DOLORES)
           You gotta be part of it.

           We have to do it.

                          PAT
           Where's Tiffany?

           PAT SR.
           She left.

                          PAT
           What do you mean, she left?

           PAT SR.
           She left. What do you think!

                          PAT
           Where is she?

           PAT SR.
           Let me tell you, I know you don't
           wanna listen to your father, I
           didn't listen to mine but I'm
           telling you, you gotta pay
           attention to the signs. When life
           reaches out with a moment like
           this, it's a sin if you don't reach
           back. I'm telling you, it's a sin
           if you don't reach back, and it'll
           haunt you for the rest of your days
           like a curse. You're facing a big
           challenge in your life right now,
           at this very moment, right here.
           That girl loves you, she really
           loves you. And I don't know if
           Nikki ever did, but she sure as
           hell doesn't love you right now.
           I'm telling you, don't fuck this
           up.

          PAT KISSES HIM ON THE CHEEK AND RUNS OUT.

                         

          EXT. SIDEWALK - EVENING


          TIFFANY WALKS DOWN THE STREET, ALONE.

                          PAT

                          (YELLING)
           Hey!

          TIFFANY LOOKS OVER HER SHOULDER, TAKES OFF RUNNING. PAT RUNS
          AFTER HER. They turn a corner. He is chasing her, a reverse
          of their previous runs together. HE GRABS HER ARM AND SHE

          STOPS, TURNING.

                          TIFFANY

                          (UPSET)
           Would you just leave me alone?!

                          PAT
           Wait a second!

          HE PULLS A LETTER OUT.

                          PAT (CONT'D)
           I have one more letter for you to
           read, okay?

                          TIFFANY

                          (YELLING)
           What the fuck is the matter with
           you? Give it to her yourself!

                          PAT
           Let me say something. You don't
           ever have to see me again if you
           just read it, alright?

                          TIFFANY
           This is so fucked up.

                          PAT
           Yeah, just read it.

          TIFFANY UNFOLDS THE LETTER.

                          TIFFANY

                          (READING)
           "Dear Tiffany...
          SHE STOPS, surprised it is addressed to her.

           "...I know you wrote the letter.

           meet my crazy...."

                          (RECITING)
           "...was by doing something crazy
           yourself. Thank you. I love you. I
           knew it the minute I met you. I'm
           sorry it took so long for me to
           catch up. I just got stuck. Pat." I
           wrote that a week ago.

                          TIFFANY
           You wrote that a week ago?

                          PAT
           Yes, I did.

                          TIFFANY
           You let me lie to you for a week?

                          PAT
           I was trying to be romantic.

                          TIFFANY
           You love me?

                          PAT
           Yeah, I do.

                          TIFFANY
           Okay.
          SHE LEANS FORWARD AND KISSES HIM, they kiss. Camera pulls
          away. Score comes in.

           Sunday is my favorite day again. I

           PAT SR.
           We have to beat the Vikings by
           three. I'm givin' you a six, which
           is very generous after the beating
           you just took. So what are we
           doin', what are we talkin' about

          PAT SR. TURNS TO RANDY.

                          RANDY
           I'd like to do another parlay if we
           make it to the next round, that's

           PAT SR.

	                         Andrew Niccol
	
	
	
	
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	FADE IN:
	
	ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
	
	The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
	of looking through a kaleidoscope.
	
	As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
	inside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
	removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	The man performing this curious task is
	writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
	conservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an
	empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
	some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
	the table's paper cloth.
	
	Viktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the
	rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
	
	A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks
	ill.
	
	                    P.A.
	          Mr. Taransky --
	
	Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's walking?... Don't tell me
	          she's walking.
	              (blood slowly draining
	               from his face)
	          She is not walking... She can't
	          walk.
	
	EXT.  TRAILER - DAY
	
	NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
	face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
	from a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately
	follows after Nicola.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          You're in breach.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Is this about the new pages? --
	          I made the changes you wanted,
	          you're in virtually every scene --
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (wheeling on him)
	          It's not the size of the role,
	          Viktor.
	              (suddenly very cool)
	          Am I or am I not contractually
	          entitled to the biggest trailer on
	          the set?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding the enormous
	               silver fish behind them,
	               confused)
	          It's the biggest on earth!  I
	          swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --
	          they don't make them any longer
	          than that.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Taller, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taller?  What?
	
	Viktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does
	indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (walking away)
	          You've insulted me for the last
	          time.
	
	Viktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Nicola, it's just the tires --
	          they're over-inflated!  I can fix
	          it!
	
	Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
	stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See, it's lower already.
	
	Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
	PUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I beg you.  You can't do this to
	          me.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (looking back)
	          I had three other offers.  I only
	          signed on to this picture out of...
	          loyalty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Then show some.  They'll shut me
	          down!
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (opening the car door)
	          It wasn't working anyhow.  The
	          scene with the thousand geese -- I
	          don't understand this film.  I
	          don't think anyone will understand
	          it.  I already put out a press
	          release -- citing "creative
	          differences".
	
	Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know what, Nicola, you're
	          right.
	              (picking up her last piece
	               of luggage)
	          Here, let me help you with that.
	              (holding the door for her)
	          You ought to go.  The truth is I
	          don't deserve you.  This film
	          doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it
	          deserves much, much better.  The
	          reason it's not working is because
	          you're not about the work.
	
	Nicola is stunned.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the limo driver)
	          To Hell, please.
	
	The door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the
	still hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor
	apprehensively.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the crew)
	          What are you looking at?  Get back
	          to work.
	
	The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
	veil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (whispered)
	          Jack... are you there?
	
	                    HAL
	          I'm here.  I'm right beside you.
	
	A NUN enters.
	
	                    NUN
	              (to Hal)
	          You should really go now.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          No, it's alright.  Please, let him
	          stay.
	
	The nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
	breaking down.
	
	                    HAL
	              (a glance to heaven)
	          What kind of cruel God is it that
	          would take you away from me?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          The same one who brought me to you.
	
	                    HAL
	          No... I cannot accept it.  If
	          something like this can happen. 
	          What...
	              (struggling to find the
	               words)
	          What is it for?
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (smiles through her pain)
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	Nicola dies peacefully.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
	head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. 
	It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	The lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          She's good.  You can hardly tell
	          she's reading off a teleprompter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ignoring him)
	          I've analyzed the footage.  We've
	          got almost everything we need in
	          the can.  If we rework the script,
	          we can finish the film without her.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (forceful shake of the
	               head)
	          According to the writ her attorneys
	          filed at noon today.  They'll sue
	          if the film is released with Nicola
	          in a single frame.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (more anxious)
	          So we'll re-cast.
	
	                    HAL
	          Nicola Anders is the only actress
	          who can play that role.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not
	          bigger than this picture.
	
	Elaine finally speaks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course she is.  No other name is
	          going to sign on now and risk
	          offending her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We don't need a name.  We'll cast
	          an unknown.
	
	                    HAL
	          I won't play opposite an unknown.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's
	          soured on the project and we have
	          to accept that.  If we ever want to
	          be in the Nicola Anders business
	          again, we have to cut our losses
	          and shelve the picture.
	
	The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (aghast)
	          No!  You will not give in to that
	          blackmailing bitch!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (a wince, addressing
	               everyone but Viktor)
	          Excuse us.
	
	Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
	soundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's company.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, Viktor.  Why do you always
	          have to make things so difficult
	          for yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Difficult.  I'm difficult.
	
	He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the candy)
	          -- Do you know what these are,
	          Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (talking a piece of candy
	               and eating it)
	          Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
	          Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I,
	          Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
	          Award nominated director --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- overseeing the most cherished
	          movie project of my career, am
	          walking around with a pocketful of
	          cherry Mike & Ike's?
	
	Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I have a feeling you're going to
	          tell me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I'll tell you why.  It is
	          because Miss Nicola Anders,
	          supermodel with a SAG card God's
	          gift to cinema, has it written into
	          her contract that all cherry Mike &
	          Ike's be removed from her candy
	          dish along with strict instructions
	          that any room she walks into should
	          have seven packs of cigarettes
	          waiting for her three of them
	          opened, that there be a personal
	          jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
	          dressing room, and that any time
	          she travels, her nanny must fly
	          with her first class.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- What's wrong with that?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, she doesn't have any
	          children!
	              (grabbing her arm)
	          Don't you see?  We're being held
	          hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
	          someone somewhere has decreed are
	          the A-list.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          The public decides who's on that
	          list.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Please.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's the truth.  Those 17
	          superstars are our insurance
	          policy.  We can't open -- can't
	          make a profit without them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We can hardly make a profit with
	          them.  Up-front salary, back-end
	          deal, perks, per diem, percentages 
	          -- They're mocking us, Elaine. 
	          We're at their mercy.
	              (staring wistful, into
	               space)
	          We always had movie stars but they
	          used to be our stars.  We used to
	          decide who would play what role. 
	          We told them what to wear, what to
	          say, who to date.  When they were
	          under contract, we could change
	          their names if we wanted to -- more
	          than once!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (regarding him as if he's
	               insane)
	          You realize you're nostalgic for an
	          era you weren't even born in?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated at her
	               infuriating logic)
	          Well, I do remember why I started
	          out in this business -- you seem to
	          have forgotten -- working in New
	          York with Cassevetes -- we were
	          trying to do something important,
	          shine a light in that darkened
	          cinema --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)
	          -- It's called a projector.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ignoring her)
	          -- Illuminate hearts and minds with
	          a ray of truth.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor, I have good
	          memories of those days too -- but
	          this isn't about that or you or me
	          or some high-minded ideal.  This is
	          business.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Spare me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (gesturing at the studio
	               lot)
	          -- Christ, Viktor, look around. 
	          What do you think pays for all
	          this?  This is about investment and
	          return.  Those days in New York...
	          that's... it's over.
	
	A pause.  Viktor reads Elaine's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're not renewing my contract.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How can I?  Your last three
	          pictures tanked.  The board is
	          giving me hell.  No bankable star
	          will work with you after this.  If
	          you just compromised... a little.
	
	Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
	news.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (rueful smile)
	          -- Well, it's not every day you're
	          fired by the mother of your own
	          child.
	
	Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
	moment between them.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening, a heart-to
	               heart)
	          I'm not taking away your daughter,
	          just your deal.  You and I both
	          know, after the divorce I kept you
	          on for old time's sake, so you
	          could still hold your head up in
	          front of Lainey.  I called what's
	          his name at Warner's.  He said he'd
	          take a meeting -- in July.  I've
	          fought for you Viktor...
	              (voice trails off)
	          You want to talk severance?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (staring off into the
	               distance, face hardening)
	          You can have everything -- office,
	          car, assistants -- all I want is
	          the picture.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          The picture's dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          So there's no problem -- I can have
	          the rights, the negative too?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (believing she's getting
	               off lightly)
	          They're yours.  But how are you
	          going to finish it?  Without a star
	          there's no movie.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't need a star.  All I need is
	          an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
	          cut out Nicola and replace her with
	          a real actor.  A real leading lady.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Even if you find her, you know the
	          problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If
	          they're good, they get known.  And
	          then you're back to sorting their
	          candy... and worse.
	              (kissing him on the cheek
	               as she departs in her
	               studio golf cart)
	          I'm sorry, Viktor.
	
	Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
	alone on the deserted lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
	
	Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame.  VIKTOR's face
	appears amongst them.
	
	They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
	of an electric cart.  A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
	standees from around the lot.
	
	VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
	we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
	year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop
	computer.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly ashamed)
	          Hello, sweetheart.
	
	Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the
	suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
	
	Lainey smiles sweetly.  She hugs him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I'm sorry Mom canned you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (shrugging)
	          It's really... not anything,
	          Lainey.  It's just --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Don't feel too bad.
	              (glancing to a standee)
	          Mom runs the place and they still
	          walk all over her.  You're better
	          off out of it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding his daughter)
	          You look very grown up.  What are
	          you doing?  You meeting your mom
	          for dinner?
	
	She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
	ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
	boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Kent got tickets to the ballet.
	
	Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.

	              (trying to convince
	               himself as much as
	               Lainey)
	          I'm going to finish the picture,
	          sweetheart.  It's important.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're
	          Viktor Taransky.
	
	Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.  She runs to her
	mother and Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          That's right.  I'm Viktor Taransky.

	                    VIKTOR
	              (faint glimmer of
	               recognition)
	          That's right.  You were booed off
	          the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Eight years ago.  In that whole
	          time, I never left my computer.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (wary)
	          Good for you, Hank.
	
	                    HANK
	              (referring to his covered
	               eye)
	          Good and bad.  They think that's
	          what caused this.  Me eye tumor. 
	          Microwaves from the screen.  It's
	          the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy
	          too.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding the pathetic
	               figure with the tilted
	               head)
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                    HANK
	          Don't be.  It was worth it.
	
	Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket.  Viktor
	now understands the significance of the gesture.
	
	                    HANK
	          You have to see her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (loading cans into the
	               car)
	          I've seen them all before.
	
	                    HANK
	          Not like this --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (patronizing smile)
	          Come on, Hank.  A synthespian,
	          virtual actor -- ?
	
	                    HANK
	              (irritated)
	          -- We call them "vactors".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I need flesh and --
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Flesh is weak.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- a living, breathing actor -- I
	          can't work with a fake.
	
	Viktor loads his film cans into the car.
	
	                    HANK
	              (pointing to Nicola in
	               Variety)
	          You already do.  But my actor won't
	          get old, fat, lazy or drunk --
	          won't throw tantrums, demand a body
	          double, script changes or a bigger
	          trailer.
	              (whispers, conspiratorial)
	          The Disney Corporation has been
	          using artificial actors for years.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's the point, Hank.  No matter
	          how good they are, they're still
	          Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. 
	          Everyone's failed.  It can't be
	          done.
	
	                    HANK
	          It can -- with my new computer
	          code, you and me, we can do it
	          together.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't know anything about
	          computers.
	
	                    HANK
	          That's why you're so perfect.  You
	          have something I don't have.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What's that?
	
	                    HANK
	          An eye -- for performance.  You
	          know the truth when you see it.  I
	          know.  I've seen your movies.  I
	          love your movies.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?
	
	                    HANK
	          "Straw God" changed my life.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You saw that?
	
	                    HANK
	          I've seen every frame of your work. 
	          You're the only filmmaker in
	          Hollywood with the artistic
	          integrity to realize my vision. 
	          You and me, art and science... we
	          are the perfect marriage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Listen, Hank, it's been a rough
	          day.
	              (climbing into his car)
	          I'll call you about his next week.
	
	                    HANK
	              (at the car window)
	          I won't be here next week.  The
	          tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winding down the window)
	          I'm already dead.
	
	Viktor's car roars away.  He looks back at the forlorn Hank
	in the rear view mirror.
	
	                    HANK
	          Call me.
	              (looking at his watch)
	          This week!
	
	A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
	wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
	
	A sea of ingenue headshots.  Black X's are drawn through all
	of them.  VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
	the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone, referring to
	               a young woman's headshot)
	          -- What do you mean she won't work
	          with me?  She's done nothing.  She
	          doesn't have a single credit --
	
	                    AGENT'S VOICE
	              (from phone, off-camera)
	          -- Better no credits than a
	          Taransky credit.  No young actress
	          is going to step into Nicola
	          Anders' shoes and risk ending her
	          career before it's even started.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Art, you don't understand.  I've
	          mortgaged everything to finish this
	          film -- creditors calling, coming
	          to the house, for God's sake, I
	          need this --
	
	The phone goes dead.  Viktor tries to re-dial --
	disconnected.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Damn.
	
	Sharp knock on his door.  Viktor peers through a curtain and
	spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
	to be a legal notice in his hands.
	
	Viktor slips out of the back door.
	
	EXT.  BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR hurries along the beach.  When he turns, he discovers
	the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.  As Viktor runs, the Suit
	runs -- calling out to him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (calling back)
	          I'm not him.
	
	Viktor stumbles.  When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
	          estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
	              (showing him Hank's
	               obituary in the L.A. 
	               Times)
	          It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
	          you have this.
	
	The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it?
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          I have no idea, Sir.  He wanted you
	          to have it.
	
	The Suit departs.  Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
	the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.  The hard-drive
	is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
	
	                      SIX MONTHS LATER
	
	CLOSE UP ON
	
	a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
	
	On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red
	carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
	venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  To save money
	on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
	NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
	
	EXT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
	
	VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.  No paparazzi, no
	limos, no klieg lights.  Resorting to giving away tickets to
	PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
	trash.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Want to see a free movie?
	
	                    HOMELESS MAN
	              (he thinks)
	          No.
	
	A taxi pulls up.  Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (kissing him hello)
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Lainey.
	
	Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
	cash.  Lainey pays herself.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Your mother couldn't make it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's at the premiere of "A Cold
	          Day In Hell".  But I think she send
	          someone from Acquisitions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She still with Kent?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          This week anyhow.
	
	VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
	the pathetic premiere.  As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
	sole spotlight expires.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite how I imagined it --
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking on the bright
	               side)
	          -- You finished the film on your
	          own terms, that's what matters. 
	          Did you really do all the post
	          yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There was no other way.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I missed you.  I wondered if you
	          were ever coming back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Me too.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the makeshift
	               poster, trying to lift
	               his spirits)
	          Well, I can't wait to meet
	          Simone... what's her last name?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know, I... don't know.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Is she here tonight?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She can't watch herself.
	
	They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
	
	                    THEATER OWNER
	          -- Hey, we have to start.  I've got
	          "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
	
	EXT.  PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
	
	A foggy, empty pier.  A MAN is running through the mist,
	shouting desperately.
	
	                    HAL
	          Valarie!  VALARIE!
	
	Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
	hood, her back to us.  The camera pushes in, music swells and
	she turns.  SIMONE.  She is exquisitely, ethereally
	beautiful.  Perfect.
	
	INT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
	playing ON THE SCREEN.
	
	When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
	change.  They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
	OWNER.  Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
	faces, some opened-mouthed.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ON SCREEN, approaching)
	          Valarie, what are you running from?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (enigmatic smile)
	          From Valarie.
	
	Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.  Simone collapses to the
	ground.
	
	                    HAL
	              (running to her)
	          Valarie!  No!
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
	while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.  Viktor finally
	musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	The same scene that played in the studio screening room. 
	However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
	leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.  Now even LAINEY is affected by
	Simone's performance.  She wipes a tear from her eye.
	
	VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
	audience reaction.  Finally the credits roll.
	
	A dedication, "For HANK".
	
	No one moves from their seats.  Viktor permits himself a
	brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
	credits:
	
	                 A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
	
	Still no one moves from their seats.  Viktor cannot stand it
	any longer.  He runs to the restroom.
	
	INT.  THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
	
	Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
	water.  He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
	reflection.  He rehearses a courtroom speech.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
	          may be guilty of a crime, but it
	          was committed with the purest of
	          intentions, to send a message to
	          the acting community who put
	          themselves above the work and
	          above --
	
	Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom.  They approach the
	urinals.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	              (continuing their
	               conversation from the
	               lobby)
	          -- So fake.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
	          -- Totally artificial.
	
	Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
	the end of their conversation.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	          We're really supposed to believe
	          that was 19th Century Lisbon?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
	          Who's looking at the sets when she
	          is on the screen?
	
	All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR exits the restroom.  Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
	including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (pointing out her father)
	          There he is.  That's my dad, Viktor
	          Taransky.
	
	Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
	spontaneously applauds.  They rush to shake his hand.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
	          -- She is magnificent.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
	          -- Absolutely unreal.
	
	Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She wasn't too... cartoony?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
	          -- Who?  The nun?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 7
	          -- Or are you talking about the
	          mother?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
	          -- A star like that, who cares
	          about the supporting cast?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
	          -- Congratulations again.  She
	          was... not of this earth.  You
	          should be very proud.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Not of this earth".  A good way of
	          putting it.  And the film as a
	          whole -- ?
	
	The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did
	          you find her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (vague)
	          I saw her picture on the, er...
	          internet.
	              (interrogating his
	               daughter's face)
	          You really didn't notice anything --
	          unusual?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Only her brilliance.  To be honest,
	          with what you had to work with, I
	          was expecting a train wreck.  You
	          really pulled it off.
	
	Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I have a feeling mom is going to
	          take you back after this.
	
	Viktor's head snaps around.  Lainey smiles.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Back on the lot.
	
	Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail. 
	His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message
	light reads "FULL".  He hits the "PLAY" button.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          Viktor, you bastard!  I hear it's
	          great.
	              (beat)
	          Seriously, I'm happy for you.
	
	Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine
	from happier times.  He gazes at it as he listens to the
	message.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          I know people are going to be
	          beating down your door but... well,
	          I'd love the chance to buy back
	          something I gave away for free. 
	          Don't you just love Hollywood?...
	          BEEP.
	
	Viktor stops the machine, dazed.  He idly opens his mail. 
	Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's
	name, "SIMONE".
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
	
	A)  A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown
	    movie theater as far as the eye can see.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          A dazzling new ingenue has come
	          from seemingly nowhere to capture
	          the hearts of movie-going audiences
	          across the nation...
	
	B)  THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads,
	    "SIMONE: A REVELATION -- Dawning Of A New Star In
	    "SUNRISE".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          ... in her debut film, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset".
	
	C)  A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first
	    website dedicated to SIMONE.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her face is already posted on
	          everything from websites to bedroom
	          walls.
	
	D)  Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in
	    Simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her wardrobe has inspired a fashion
	          craze.
	
	E)  In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an
	    UNDERCOVER REPORTER a pirated recording of SIMONE on a
	    camcorder.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          And bootleg copies of her film are
	          being sold in back alleys all over
	          the world.
	
	F)  A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter
	    showing a clip of SIMONE from, "SUNRISE, SUNSET Courtesy:
	    Taransky Productions".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from TV)
	          But who is Simone?  We know so
	          little about her.  No details of
	          her background have been released,
	          not even her age.  She is somewhere
	          between a girl and a woman.  A
	          fresh face and familiar both at the
	          same time.
	
	G)  The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a
	    multiplex.  The marquee has 16 screens and looks like
	    this:
	
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "THE MAKING OF
	                                       SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	          Is Simone even her real name?  And
	          why the secrecy?  All we know for
	          sure is that she was discovered by
	          little-known director, Viktor
	          Tarinsky.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,
	corrects the reporter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from the TV)
	          He has parlayed his relationship
	          with the new sensation into a three
	          picture deal with the very studio
	          that dumped him only six months
	          ago.  And no wonder with the
	          starlet's performance breaking all
	          box office records.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO GATE - MORNING
	
	Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
	PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
	glimpse of SIMONE.
	
	                    MOB
	          Simone!  SIMONE!  I LOVE YOU!  I
	          Want to BE you!
	
	Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
	lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
	limousine on the studio steps.
	 
	A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.  A banner
	reads, "Welcome SIMONE".  A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
	
	VIKTOR steps out of the car.  ELAINE pushes past him, into
	the limo.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone!... Simone?
	
	The car is empty.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (re-emerging from the car)
	          Where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good to see you too, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring his sarcasm)
	          Why isn't she with you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Why?  Because she would never show
	          up at something like this.  She's
	          intensely private.
	
	Elaine sighs, exasperated.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (dismissing her
	               colleagues)
	          Back to work, everyone.  She's not
	          here.
	
	The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor... I want to thank you for
	          convincing Simone to sign with the
	          studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't thank me.  It was entirely
	          Simone's decision.  Do you have
	          Simone's check?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it
	          means a lot.
	              (quickly changing tack)
	          Have you read the reviews?  They're
	          love letters.
	              (reading from a newspaper)
	          Listen to this one.  "Simone has
	          the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
	          the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
	          of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
	          face of Audrey Hepburn combined
	          with an angel".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (musing to himself)
	          Almost right.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't wait to meet her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't know if that's going to
	          happen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Why not?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I say, she's... something of a
	          recluse.  That's how she's able to
	          stay so pure -- by isolating
	          herself in her art.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (face falling)
	          Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a
	          press conference.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Out of the question.  A circus like
	          that?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, it's my studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's my actor.  There are other
	          studios, Elaine.  There's only one
	          Simone.
	              (leaving her on the steps)
	          Leave the press conference to me.
	
	Viktor strides up the studio steps.  Elaine stares after her
	ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
	arrogance.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
	
	The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
	podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent
	fame by association.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (tapping the microphone)
	          Is this on?
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          Who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky, Viktor.  T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
	          V-i-k-t-o-r.
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          Yeah, but -- who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (patronizing smile)
	          I am a two-time Academy Award
	          nominated director with over
	          eighteen films to my credit thus
	          far including my latest release,
	          "Sunrise, Sunset".  Who are you?
	
	A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I will not be taking any questions. 
	          However I do have a statement to
	          read on behalf of my leading lady,
	          Simone.
	              (reading from his
	               statement)
	          "To Whom It May Concern.  I'm
	          deeply grateful for the
	          extraordinary public response to
	          Mr. Taransky's film.  At this time
	          I will be conducting no interviews
	          or making publicity appearances
	          since I am really nothing without
	          the beautiful worlds and characters
	          Mr. Taransky creates for me.  I
	          politely request that the press
	          respect my privacy and let the work
	          speak for itself.  All questions
	          and inquiries should be directed to
	          Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
	          aspects of my career.  Yours very
	          truly, Simone".
	
	The reporters all call out at once.
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
	          dating?
	
	                    REPORTER 3
	          -- Viktor, where'd you find her?
	
	                    REPORTER 4
	          -- Is Simone her real name?
	
	                    REPORTER 5
	          -- What's she got to hide?
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          -- Is she the new Garbo?
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Who's Garbo?
	
	Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
	hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I thought I made it clear -- no
	          questions regarding Simone.
	              (bringing the press
	               conference to a hasty
	               conclusion)
	          Now, I would like to close by
	          announcing that Miss Simone begins
	          production today on her next film,
	          "Eternity Forever".  This project
	          has been near and dear to my heart
	          since I wrote it nine years ago.
	              (a tinge of bitterness,
	               then a smile)
	          I Thank you.
	
	Viktor exits the podium.  A voice stops him in his tracks.
	
	                    VOICE (O.S.)
	          Who do you think you're fooling,
	          Taransky?
	
	Viktor turns.  The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
	truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
	by his assistant, MILTON.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do I know you?
	
	                    MAX
	          Max Sayer -- National Echo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regaining his composure,
	               a smirk)
	          Don't you have a real story to
	          write?  Why aren't you in Latin
	          America?
	
	                    MAX
	          This is the story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I remember when the Echo had class 
	          -- the paper that could bring down
	          governments.
	
	                    MAX
	          Our leaders aren't presidents
	          anymore -- they're pop stars and
	          screen idols.  If Woodward and
	          Bernstein were alive today, they'd
	          be right here in Hollywood with me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          They are alive, Sayer.
	
	Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
	
	                    MAX
	          So they're probably here.
	              (hardly missing a beat)
	          You might be able to sell this
	          'disappearing act' to the rest of
	          the world, but I'm not buying it. 
	          What's really behind this Simone
	          woman?  The public has a right to
	          know.  Why is she staying out of
	          sight?  And why the hell is she
	          with you?  I don't want you to take
	          this the wrong way, Viktor, but
	          you're not exactly Cecil B. 
	          DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Maybe the reason she's with me is a
	          little thing called integrity,
	          Sayer.  Look it up.
	
	Viktor walks away.
	
	                    MAX
	              (calling after him)
	          Oh, I know all about integrity.  I
	          know even more about persistence. 
	          Look that one up.
	
	Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
	
	EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
	
	"CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
	panning the entrance.  A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
	nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
	cart, script in hand.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          No one came in or went out just
	          like you said, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          Is Miss Simone coming today?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's already here.  She arrived
	          before you and she'll leave long
	          after you've gone.
	              (admonishing guard)
	          Remember, under no circumstances
	          are you or any other person to
	          enter the set without my express
	          permission.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          What if it catches on fire?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let it burn.  Simone would rather
	          go up in flames than give up her
	          privacy.
	
	Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
	the soundstage.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
	a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
	tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
	side monitors.  VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself as he inserts
	               his Hollywood hard-drive 
	               -- SIMULATION ONE)
	          Pay no attention to the man behind
	          the computer.
	
	A title appears on his computer screen.
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                       SIMULATION ONE
	
	With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
	revises the title to:
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                           SIMONE
	
	He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
	wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
	emerges -- SIMONE.  She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
	blood actress.
	
	Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
	titled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor
	she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a
	little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
	too long.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the screen)
	          Good morning, Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A star is...
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          ... digitized.
	
	Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
	into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
	key on his keyboard.  When he speaks, she speaks.  Simone's
	voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
	Viktor's voice.  A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
	mimic his movements.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You mean they buy it?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nervous smile as he
	               examines his first
	               royalty check)
	          Buy it?  They're paying for it. 
	          And around here that's how you
	          really know they buy it.
	
	Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
	the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
	          see this.
	
	Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (depressing the button
	               every time he wants to
	               express his thoughts
	               through Simone)
	          Maybe he can.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do you have any idea what this
	          means, Simone?  Our ability to
	          manufacture fraud now exceeds our
	          ability to detect it.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (appearing to indulge
	               Viktor with a smile)
	          I am the death of real.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pondering the enormity of
	               the hoax)
	          You are birth of... what?  A
	          Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era
	          in show business.  All I wanted to
	          do was finish the film.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started.
	
	Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
	amusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hmm... a little less Streep, a
	          little more Bacall.
	
	Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
	dead, that comprise Simone.
	
	Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
	dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
	deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
	
	He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment.  The
	voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
	representations of the sound waves.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it is.
	
	VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself.  He scrolls through the
	list of screen legends.  He clicks on the image of AUDREY
	HEPBURN.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          While I think of it, I'd like you
	          to add something to your repertoire
	          -- remember that thing Hepburn does
	          in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
	
	A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
	the screen.  Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
	
	                    AUDREY HEPBURN
	              (from the screen, an
	               incomparable smile)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pausing the moment)
	          Let's hear you say "Hi" like
	          Audrey.
	
	With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
	into a frozen Simone.  Viktor presses play.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (imitating Audrey's
	               performance perfectly)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect.
	              (stretching)
	          God, I'm so relaxed around you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You did create me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.  I... just helped bring someone
	          else's dream to life.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
	          nothing without you.  I was
	          computer code -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're right.  You're right.  Of
	          course, one doesn't want to boast. 
	          It's a classic case of technology
	          in search of an artist.  That's all
	          you've been waiting for, an artist
	          with integrity, with a vision, who
	          can see.
	
	Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
	his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
	nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See beyond that irrational
	          allegiance to flesh and blood. --
	          See that with the rise in price of
	          a real actor and the fall in price
	          of a fake, the scales have tipped
	          in favor of the fake.
	              (voice raising in
	               excitement)
	          -- See that if the performance is
	          genuine, it doesn't matter if the
	          actor is real.  Once a performance
	          is committed to film, the blood and
	          bones are gone anyway.  Only the
	          spirit, the illusion remains. 
	          Besides, what's real anymore? 
	          These days most actors have digital
	          work done to them so it's a gray
	          area.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (Simone appears to look
	               directly at her maker)
	          Are you ever going to tell the
	          truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The only real truth is in the work.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You know what I'm talking about.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the
	          truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
	              (pondering his own
	               question)
	          Of course, with Hank's tragic
	          passing, the secret died with him.
	              (shaking the thought from
	               his head)
	          I am going to tell the truth...
	          after your next picture.
	
	Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject. 
	He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Speaking of which -- this is the
	          project I'd like you to do next.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The
	          legendary unproduced script that
	          was too good ever to get made?  I'd
	          kill for that part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I was hoping you'd say that.
	
	Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pretending to be hard of
	               hearing)
	          I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. 
	          What did you say?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
	RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button.  He is
	unable to resist speaking another line.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And I will never, ever leave you.
	
	Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
	until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
	"GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
	FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
	
	Viktor comes close to the monitor.  He notices something
	about Simone's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so beautiful.  Too
	          beautiful.
	
	Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
	He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
	
	From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
	empty soundstage.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	VIKTOR's face against the SKY.  As he walks, we reveal that
	the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
	studio lot -- behind a parking lot.  Viktor hands his valet
	ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
	
	                    VALET MANAGER
	          -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky. 
	          We gave you a complimentary car
	          wash -- they're washing the engine
	          now.
	
	Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
	their cars under an umbrella.  A young TALENT AGENT
	approaches.
	
	                    TALENT AGENT
	          Viktor!  Look, I'm sorry I didn't
	          call you back last year.  I was,
	          er... out of the country.
	              (strained moment)
	          But we should get together.  My
	          schedule's wide open.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Sure, I'll... "call you".
	
	The agent's face falls.  He gets in his car, disconsolate.
	
	Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
	
	                    HAL
	          Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          The film.  The chemistry.  No
	          reflections on Nicola but Simone
	          and I -- we were just so right
	          together.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You never were together, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          And still the connection was
	          undeniable.
	              (aside)
	          I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
	          but I know it's brilliant.  And I
	          know I would be perfect for Clive.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (correcting him)
	          Clyde.
	
	                    HAL
	          Yes, perfect.
	              (lowering his voice)
	          As a matter of fact, I ran into
	          Simone on the lot the other day.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (genuinely startled)
	          Really?  She didn't mention it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (quickly covering)
	          I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
	          of people right now.
	              (under his breath)
	          She is just as you described her,
	          Viktor... indescribable.  I
	          strongly sensed she thought I was
	          right for it.
	
	Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
	his cell phone.  The phone rings.  Viktor feigns surprise and
	answers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (answering the phone he
	               has just dialed, louder
	               than necessary)
	          Hello?... SIMONE!  How are you,
	          sweetheart?
	
	A hush descends over the executives.  Hal is suddenly very
	uncomfortable.  Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
	conversation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winking to Hal)
	          You'll never guess who I'm with...
	          you ran into him on the lot.
	
	                    HAL
	          It was more in passing.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so far off!
	              (finally chuckles)
	          Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
	          star.  Remember now?... No, I don't
	          think he's put on weight.
	              (a shrug of apology to the
	               appalled Hal)
	          Anyway, you think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction...
	              (covering phone, to Hal)
	          I'll try to talk her into it.
	
	The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark.  A
	mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
	into his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          ... Listen this is a bad place to
	          talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
	          you have charity work you want to
	          do, I know you want to give back --
	          but remember, your greatest gift is
	          your talent... we'll talk about it
	          at the beach house this weekend...
	          I'm looking forward to it too.
	
	Viktor hangs up.  His car pulls up.  He tips extravagantly
	and drives away.  The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
	phones.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
	
	Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
	windows.
	
	INT.  CAR - DAY
	
	Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in
	hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a
	computer.
	
	                    VIKTOR'S VOICE
	              (from the machine)
	          -- "... You think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction..."
	
	                    MILTON
	              (to Max, a shake of the
	               head)
	          I'm getting nothing from her side
	          of the conversation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Is it a jamming device?
	
	                    MILTON
	              (shrugs)
	          Maybe he's talking to himself.
	
	                    MAX
	              (dismissing the idea)
	          Taransky isn't that good an actor. 
	          No, they're taking special
	          precautions.  Some kind of new
	          encryption.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Why?
	
	                    MAX
	              (musing)
	          Whatever it is, it's dark.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Dark?
	
	                    MAX
	          Yes, very.
	
	They continue listening to the recording.
	
	                    VIKTOR'S VOICE
	          "... We'll talk about it at the
	          beach house this weekend..."
	
	MAX's eyes light up.  He gazes to a photo of SIMONE pasted to
	the inside of the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING
	
	VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.  Lainey is in her pajamas,
	occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father
	prepares French toast.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to the computer)
	          Can't you stop that?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Those things can be dangerous. 
	          Staring at a screen all day -- you
	          miss what's going on outside in the
	          real world.  You can lose yourself. 
	          You should get out more.  How are
	          you going to meet boys?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs coyly, getting up)
	          I know plenty of boys.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Really?  Who?  Where do you meet
	          them?  In a chat room?  How do you
	          know he's not some middle-aged
	          freak?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak
	          a mile away.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Okay.  But you have to find a way
	          to escape that thing.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          How?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I read.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?  Still?  I can't tell you
	          how happy I am to hear that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          You were the one who insisted on
	          it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and
	          Joyce when I was four.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understood them.  That's what
	          was amazing.
	              (looking out the window)
	          It's a nice day.  Let's eat
	          outside.
	
	Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door.  We hear a
	chorus of CLICKS.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Actually, it may be nicer inside.
	
	Viktor joins her at the doorway.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Stay here, I'll deal with this.
	
	Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
	
	Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
	of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS.  The next door houses
	have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
	
	VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
	the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
	waving extravagantly.
	
	Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
	nearby rooftop.  The photographer limps towards the fence. 
	Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
	and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
	relishing the attention.
	
	The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
	several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          That wasn't her, Taransky.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Where is she?  You can't hide her
	          forever.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (hurling the camera into
	               the mob)
	          You'll never find her.  Simone only
	          appears when I want her to appear.
	
	MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
	accompanied by assistant MILTON.
	
	                    MAX
	          She sounds like a prisoner,
	          Taransky.  Are you holding her
	          hostage?  Are you some kind of
	          Svengali?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (recognizing the reporter)
	          Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
	          you?  You look kind of "captive"
	          yourself.  While you're spending
	          every waking hour obsessing over
	          Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
	          doesn't even know you exist.  Get
	          off my property or I'll call the
	          cops.
	
	                    MAX
	          The cops?  The cops read my column
	          to know who to bust.  We're the
	          only watchdog the public has.
	              (looking around at the
	               photographers)
	          None of this is going away.  We'll
	          be here tomorrow and the day after
	          that.  Until you slip up.  And you
	          will.  You are looking at your
	          shadow.
	              (getting in his face)
	          Because all these elaborate
	          precautions with Simone -- every
	          instinct in my body tells me, it's
	          not natural.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. 
	          I don't want you to be
	          disappointed.  It gets cold out
	          here at night.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice try.  If we can't get to her
	          through you, maybe your family will
	          be more co-operative.  I can
	          guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
	          another, Miss Simone and I are
	          going to get acquainted.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning away)
	          I'd like to see that, Sayer. 
	          Invite me.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the
	passenger seat.  They have become so blase about the
	paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle
	PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
	
	                    REPORTER (ON RADIO)
	          -- The rumor is, Simone is holed up
	          in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far
	          we haven't seen so much as a
	          glimpse --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (switching off the radio)
	          Honey, I'm really sorry about all
	          this.  I don't know if it's safe
	          for you to stay the weekends...
	          just until things settle down.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs)
	          Okay, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          If anyone asks about Simone --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I know, I don't know anything.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Exactly.
	              (slightly irritated by her
	               lack of interest)
	          Don't you wonder where I'm really
	          hiding Simone?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking to him)
	          I'm sure you'd tell me if you
	          thought it was important.
	
	Lainey gives her father a smile.  Through the car window
	behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops
	down a bank.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion.  LAINEY
	gives her father a kiss and departs.  ELAINE, in the garden,
	overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (from the car)
	          Sorry I didn't get her back in
	          time.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No problem.
	              (she smiles)
	          Do you want to come in?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (surprised -- pleasantly)
	          Why not?
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where KENT
	is working on a computer.  Kent smiles blandly.
	
	                    KENT
	          Hey, Vik.
	
	                    VIKTOR

	          Hello -- Kent.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room.  Despite the eighty
	degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth. 
	ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file.  Viktor's face
	falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, we simply have to talk
	          about "Eternity..."
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Forever".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whatever.  I still haven't received
	          Simone's script notes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There aren't any.  If the
	          filmmakers are happy, Simone's
	          happy.  She considers herself an...
	          "instrument".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Really?  Oh, so she's really going
	          to do all this nudity?

	Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, something has to be done
	          about this budget.  It's completely
	          unrealistic.
	              (referring to a column in
	               the budget)
	          You allowed nothing for limousine
	          service.

	          She'll drive herself.

	          Hair and make-up?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll do her own.  Theater
	          training.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was in the theater?  When? 
	          Where?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll send you her resume.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Al least a contingency for
	          wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a
	          dress size.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I guarantee she won't gain an
	          once.  She's very disciplined.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned by an entry in
	               the budget)
	          Well, we have to do something about
	          this -- "stuntwoman".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What about it?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          There isn't one.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No need.  She does all her own
	          stunts.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (skeptical)
	          Even the fall from the plane?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nonchalant)
	          Even the fall from the plane.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, shoot it on the last day.
	
	Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I've tried to explain to you,
	          Elaine.  Simone isn't like any
	          other actress you've ever known. 
	          She's about the work and only the
	          work -- lives for the work.  She
	          wants all the money up there...
	              (gazing into space)
	          ... on the screen where it belongs. 
	          She'd work for scale except I know
	          you only respect people you pay a
	          fortune.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Which accounts for your percentage.
	              (tossing the budget on the
	               coffee table)
	          When do I get to meet this dream?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not today.  She's learning her
	          lines.
	              (glancing to Elaine's
	               budget)
	          You can also take cue cards and
	          teleprompter out of the budget.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (smiles)
	          I'll walk you out.
	
	Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
	
	ELAINE's demeanor softens.  She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
	sympathetically.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
	          you now, not as Elaine, studio
	          head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
	              (correcting herself)
	          Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this
	          last time but you need to be
	          careful.  We both know you wouldn't
	          be making this overblown art film
	          of you hadn't convinced Simone to
	          be in it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, talking to you now, not as
	          Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
	          husband... what the hell happened
	          to you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (exasperated)
	          Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this
	          a hundred times -- young stars
	          destroying the very people who
	          discovered them.  I'm worried about
	          you, that's all.  This woman -- she
	          controls your destiny.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone does not control my destiny.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of
	          my feelings.  There's something
	          about her I don't trust.

	          Thanks for taking me back, Mr.
	          Taransky.  I know it looked like I
	          sided with the studio, but I always

	          I can't tell you how delighted I am
	          to have this wonderful cast
	          assembled for "Eternity Forever". 
	          Thank you all.  Now, a reminder --
	          as a condition for working on this
	          film, you will not be rehearsing
	          with Simone, shooting with Simone
	          and you are forbidden from
	          contacting Simone in any way at any
	          time, whatsoever.

	          Simone can thank you herself.  She
	          insisted on speaking with you
	          before filming begins.  She's on
	          the line now.

	          minute.
	
	Viktor exits.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Hi.  Who's there?  Don't be shy. 
	          Introduce yourselves.
	
	The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone.  Mac breaks
	the silence.
	
	                    MAC
	          I'm Mac.  I turned down a
	          Bertolucci film to be here.
	
	                    LOTUS
	          My name's Lotus.  God, I can't
	          believe I'm talking to you.  We're
	          going to become such great friends.
	
	                    HAL
	          I'm Hal.  Wonderful to be working
	          together... again.
	
	The other cast members introduce themselves.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the
	nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital
	player, connected to a phone.  Simone's pre-recorded opening
	remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost
	completed.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Is that everyone...?
	              (pause)
	          Well, obviously, as you know...
	
	Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time,
	speaking through the synthesizer.  As usual, Viktor's voice
	is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          ... I'm Simone.   
	
	The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.
	
	                    HAL
	              (from Viktor's
	               speakerphone)
	          Obviously.  Who else?
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (from speaker phone)
	          I just want to start by apologizing
	          for my "process" --
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	The CAST are hunched over the speakerphone.
	
	                    MAC
	          -- No.  No.  I'm completely
	          simpatico.  On my last film I was
	          playing a schizophrenic so I made
	          them give me two dressing rooms.
	
	                    HAL
	              (an aside)
	          So committed.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Well thank you for your
	          understanding.  I know it's an
	          unusual way to work but I just find
	          I relate better to people when
	          they're not actually there.
	
	                    LOTUS
	          Of course, of course.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          I don't have much to say except
	          that I know it's going to be a
	          great project, if we all just trust
	          Mr. Taransky's vision.  Always do
	          what Mr. Taransky says.  If in
	          doubt, do it the Taransky way.
	
	They all nod vigorously in agreement.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          I know we're going to make a
	          wonderful movie together.
	
	                    LOTUS
	              (nodding in agreement)
	          Wonderful movie.
	
	                    HAL
	          Together, absolutely.
	
	EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
	
	VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage.  A young
	cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart,
	tentatively approaches.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          Mr. Taransky...
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the stage)
	          No one goes in there.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          Oh, I know.
	
	Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          If it's not too much trouble. 
	          Could you...?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course...
	
	                    VIVIAN
	              (hesitant about broaching
	               the subject)
	          This last year I was... going
	          through some things.
	              (shaking her head at the
	               memory)
	          Awful, awful... things.  But when I
	          saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
	          did... in the scene in the
	          fireworks factory...
	              (face lighting up)
	          ... suddenly everything made sense. 
	          My friends, family, doctors --
	          nobody could reach me -- but
	          Simone, she really... spoke to me.
	
	Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll be happy to sign it.
	
	INT.  PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	A green set.  Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green.  A FULL
	CAST shoots HAL, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively
	crossing the green expanse.
	
	Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward. 
	Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the
	ground.
	
	                    VIKTOR (O.S.)
	          Cut!  Cut!... Cut!
	
	Hal freezes.  VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and
	confronts Hal on the green floor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hal, what are you doing?
	
	                    HAL
	          Viktor, Clyde simply has to get
	          close to Simone in this scene!  He
	          has to touch her.  He has to!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Absolutely not!
	
	                    HAL
	          But she's right there!  I must feel
	          her!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You can't.
	
	                    HAL
	          Why not?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (struggling to find an
	               excuse)
	          There's... a wall between you --
	
	                    HAL
	          -- an emotional wall, I know. 
	          That's why --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- No.  No.  A real wall.
	              (describing a wall with
	               his hands within the
	               green space)
	          You ran right through it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (confused)
	          How did the wall get there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I can't explain it to you now --
	          you'll see when it's all put
	          together.
	              (walking away)
	          Anyway, we got it a couple of takes
	          ago.  Let's move on.
	
	Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with
	HAL in a scene from "Eternity Forever".  He works on her
	close up.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (eyes welling with tears)
	          -- What you don't understand,
	          Clyde, is that love is like a wild
	          flower, but that flower only
	          grows --
	
	Viktor hits STOP and Simone freezes.  Viktor brings up a menu
	and chooses from a range of "EMOTIONAL OPTIONS".
	
	   JOY                  SADNESS              FEAR
	   elated               melancholy           anxious
	   jubilant             tearful              frightened
	   giddy                weeping              petrified
	   ecstatic             blubbering           loss of bladder
	   inebriated           Kevorkian              control
	
	   CONTEMPLATION        INNOCENCE            SENSUALITY
	   reflective           chaste               seductive
	   thoughtful           virtuous             lustful
	   meditative           angelic              bestial
	   stoic                Madonna              Madonna
	   bored out of her      [Blessed Virgin]     [Like A Virgin]
	     skull
	
	He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a
	performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let's take it down a notch.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          -- What you don't understand --
	
	Simone freezes again.  Viktor make another adjustment.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I like it.  But still too big.
	              (making a correction)
	          Smaller teardrops next time.
	
	Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's not working.  It's not alive. 
	          Let's try it again.
	
	She repeats the line.  Viktor mimes the performance.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (teardrops arriving on
	               cue)
	          -- What you don't understand,
	          Clyde, is that love is like a wild
	          flower, but that flower only grows
	          on the edge...
	              (dramatic pause)
	          ... of a very high cliff.
	
	Simone FREEZES.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect, Simone.
	
	Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry you still have to
	          work with flesh and blood for the
	          time being -- as user friendly as
	          you are, even I can't manufacture
	          an entire cast.
	
	"To Vivian.  Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity
	shot.  He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
	
	Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
	she is waiting patiently, as usual.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We are going to have to change our
	          plans, Simone -- you have no idea
	          what an affect your performance is
	          having on people.  We can't stop
	          now.  There's too much to say --
	          these films they speak, they speak
	          to the human condition.  We're
	          changing lives.  No, revealing the
	          truth now would be too cruel.
	              (searching for more
	               justification)
	          Anyway, when you're seeking a
	          greater truth -- in the work -- you
	          are not so concerned with the
	          lesser truths along the way.
	
	Simone doesn't appear convinced.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You're going to get in a lot of
	          trouble, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated at her pricking
	               his conscience)
	          Why do you have to bring that up? 
	          There's always risk -- life's a
	          risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how
	          could something so lovely be a
	          crime?
	              (regarding her tenderly)
	          Well, I think we've done enough for
	          today.  You've been cooped up in
	          there too long.  How about you and
	          me go out on the town?  They're
	          expecting us.
	
	He turns to a copy of "The Echo".  A photo of Viktor at the
	gate of his Malibu home.  "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self
	proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".  Viktor
	puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an
	opulent hotel.  He approached the CONCIERGE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm checking in a special guest...
	              (obviously conspiratorial)
	          ... Miss Enomis.
	
	The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy
	of "Variety".  Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails
	To Three Picture Deal".
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	          Miss Enomis, yes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Miss Enomis demands her privacy. 
	          You will switch off all
	          surveillance cameras.  I will
	          escort Miss Enomis to her room
	          alone via the rear exit.  She will
	          require no help with her luggage. 
	          She does not wish to be disturbed
	          at any time for any reason.  She
	          will be departing for a function
	          tonight at eight sharp.
	              (tipping him with a
	               hundred dollar bill)
	          I'm sure I can rely on your
	          discretion.  Do you understand?
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	              (passing the key to
	               Viktor)
	          Oh, I understand.
	
	As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card
	to the mirror.
	
	ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
	
	The Concierge picks up his phone.
	
	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters the hotel suite.  We see a montage of scenes --
	Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
	
	A)  VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in
	    the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
	
	B)  VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
	
	C)  VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
	
	D)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
	
	E)  VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
	
	F)  VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
	
	G)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
	    a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
	    rocket.
	
	H)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
	    scatters it on the counter.
	
	I)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
	    bouncing into the toilet bowl.  He retrieves it.
	
	J)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
	    jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
	    rear entrance.
	
	K)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
	    shadow on the drapes.  A "walking" silhouette is visible
	    to the media on the street.
	
	L)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
	    LOVE YOU V--".
	
	VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door.  He looks at
	his watch.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (peering through the
	               peephole)
	          Who is it?
	
	                    WOMAN'S VOICE
	              (from other side of door)
	          It's... Simone.
	
	Viktor smiles.
	
	EXT.  HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
	YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.  A HOTEL DOORMAN
	keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
	
	Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.  The coated woman
	starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not yet.
	              (scrutinizing the crowd)
	          Where's "Matinee"?  There they are. 
	          Okay, I think everyone's here. 
	          Now!
	
	Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
	providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
	paparazzi.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          Simone!
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Over here, sweetheart!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 3
	          Come one Simone, take it off, baby!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 4
	          We got a job to do!
	
	The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER and
	MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo
	screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
	following.
	
	The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          I think I got a piece of her ear.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          I didn't get shit.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (emerging from the pack,
	               to Max)
	          Ten feet from a living Goddess...
	
	INT.  MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE.  His assistant, MILTON,
	begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for
	fingerprints, etc.  Max rubs pencil into the impression on
	the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of
	life is that it ends".
	
	                    MAX
	              (interrupting Milton's
	               work)
	          Leave me for a moment.
	
	Milton and the Concierge depart.
	
	Max is alone.  He looks around the room.
	
	A)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass
	    and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
	    plastic bag.
	
	B)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
	    it in a plastic bag.
	
	C)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
	    before placing it in a plastic bag.
	
	D)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
	
	E)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from
	    a pillow.  He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
	    in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
	
	F)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed. 
	    He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same
	    sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI
	in their wake.  Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
	head.
	
	Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not
	Simone.  FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy.  Viktor
	and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
	limousine.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (not quite able to avert
	               his eyes from her
	               telescopic legs)
	          Thank God for you, Faith.  I know
	          this is above and beyond the call
	          of duty for a stand-in.  You don't
	          know what a service you're
	          performing for Simone -- shielding
	          her from those animals.
	
	                    FAITH
	          No, thank God for you, Mr.
	          Taransky.  How many men would go
	          to so much trouble to protect a
	          woman?
	
	Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
	intimate position.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understand you'll have to come
	          back to my place to keep them off
	          the, er...
	              (his nose close to Faith's
	               neck)
	          ... scent.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Of course.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          You look so, so...
	
	                    FAITH
	          ... so much like her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course, but very beautiful
	          in your own right.
	
	                    FAITH
	          I do find myself physically
	          attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
	
	Their lips are now tantalizingly close.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Viktor.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely
	followed by FAITH on top of him.
	
	Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous.  Viktor
	hardly resists.  In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith
	murmurs in his ear.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do whatever you do to Simone.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What?... What did you say?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do what you do to Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What I do to Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Yes, call me Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (still tearing at his
	               clothes)
	          Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what
	          you do to Simone.  I want to know
	          what it's like to be her just for
	          one night.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          You're with me to be close to her?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (panting)
	          Is that a problem?
	
	As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's
	deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".
	
	                    FAITH
	          "Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (this is too much for
	               Viktor)
	          Please put your clothes on
	
	Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to
	straighten her clothes.
	
	EXT.  FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY
	
	The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
	ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmerized
	by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends.  The
	light go up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood
	          Foreign Press is going to eat this
	          up.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	              (turning to his daughter)
	          What did you think, Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          One thing bothered me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          No, not that.  I was just wondering
	          -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
	          why did Simone have no reflection
	          when she walked in front of that
	          mirror?
	
	Viktor is shocked, busted.  He covers it with a laugh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen-faced)
	          I wondered if you'd spot that. 
	          You've got a good eye, Lainey.  I'm
	          proud of you.
	
	Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I got them to remove the
	          reflection.  The mirror's metaphor 
	          -- to show how her character's
	          inwardly dead.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's genius, Viktor.  Was that
	          Simone's idea?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sarcastic, annoyed at the
	               suggestion)
	          Who else?  It's always Simone's
	          idea.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          So that accounts for the lack of a
	          shadow in reel six?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Precisely.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
	outside the theater.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (as she gets into the car)
	          Good-night, Daddy.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (kissing Lainey good-bye)
	          Night, Lainey.
	
	Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (drawing Elaine aside)
	          Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
	          idea for Lainey to come to the
	          screenings -- mature content and
	          all that.
	
	Both look to Lainey.  From inside the car Lainey watches her
	parents.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (impressed by his
	               responsible attitude)
	          Maybe you're right.
	              (gently teasing)
	          Twelve years after your daughter's
	          born you decide to become a father.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Better late than never.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening)
	          I should fire you more often.  The
	          film's looking wonderful.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You really think so?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes.  To be honest I never quite
	          saw this film before -- maybe it's
	          the way Simone is playing it -- but
	          what it's saying about the illusion
	          of permanence in everyday life, how
	          that's the only way we can love --
	          I think it's really going to mean
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you
	          liked it.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to tell her myself.
	              (cajoling)
	          When are you going to let me meet
	          her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Soon.  Soon.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Everyone I know has met her,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Everyone you know is lying.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (amused)
	          That's true.
	
	They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before. 
	However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
	shutter from a nearby bush.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damnit!
	
	The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You know how you can stop that. 
	          She has to get out more.
	              (climbing into the car)
	          See you at the premiere.
	
	Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE - DUSK
	
	The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
	hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  Red carpet, klieg lights
	searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
	
	A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out.  The
	crowd screams with excitement.
	
	Viktor waves.  Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
	their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
	car door... but nothing.  The door shuts.  A disappointed
	murmer.  The limo drives off.
	
	VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 1
	              (talking to camera)
	          -- What a night!  Anyone who's
	          anyone is here at the premiere of
	          "Eternity Forever," but waiting for
	          Simone to show may take even
	          longer.  We do have her director,
	          Viktor Taransky.
	              (ushering him over)
	          Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               focus on the star)
	          You know Simone.
	
	Other reporters force their way into the interview.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          I hope she does show up.  Some of
	          her fans got here at dawn.  We
	          don't want to disappoint them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (through a pained smile)
	          Well, I'm sure they're going to
	          love the movie.  I got the
	          inspiration --
	
	However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          HARRY EPSON!
	
	The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.  Screen idol, HARRY
	EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a
	          minute?  What brings you here
	          tonight?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (waving to the fans)
	          I just came out to support my good
	          friend, Simone.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          There's a rumor that you're more
	          than just "good friends"?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               invasion)
	          We've been seeing each other, sure,
	          but we'd rather keep our
	          relationship private.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	              (believing she has a
	               scoop)
	          Do I hear the sound of... wedding
	          bells?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (suddenly losing it)
	          I can't believe you people!  No
	          wonder she never comes to these
	          things!
	
	Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
	carpet.
	
	VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
	
	A packed, glitzy party.  VIKTOR enters without an escort. 
	Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
	alone.
	
	He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
	schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
	
	                    MOVER/SHAKER
	          Elaine!  The picture is a
	          revelation!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank you.  I mean, it was a team
	          effort --
	
	Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
	pocket camera.  Elaine is unaware of the shot.
	
	Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
	
	Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.  A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
	unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
	Daniels.  She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
	glasses off the bar.  Viktor catches it.
	
	A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.  HAL stands there
	accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
	
	                    HAL
	          Is she here?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
	
	                    HAL
	              (oblivious to his sarcasm)
	          Somebody said she was here.
	
	Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
	lipstick-smeared.
	
	                    MAC
	          Oh my God, that's her glass!
	              (impulsively smelling
	               "Simone's" glass)
	          Jack Daniels, straight-up.  She is
	          my kind of woman.
	
	                    HAL
	              (looking anxiously around
	               the room)
	          Viktor, where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's around.
	
	                    MAC
	              (dawning on him, glancing
	               to the far side of the
	               packed room)
	          Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
	          Room.
	
	                    HAL
	          You know I sometimes forget she has
	          bodily functions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (unable to resist)
	          I know what you mean.
	
	                    HAL
	              (anxiously looking to the
	               restroom)
	          I have to talk to her about my
	          experimental film.  It's very...
	          experimental.
	
	                    MAC
	          Is that her? -- By the fountain.
	
	Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
	her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (testy)
	          No.  In fact, between us, she
	          doesn't really exist.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ignoring him, calling out
	               to the woman)
	          Simone!
	
	                    MAC
	          SIMONE!
	
	Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.  They talk
	over each other.
	
	                    GUEST 1
	          -- Simone's here!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (slightly the worse for
	               drink)
	          -- When did she arrive?  Why didn't
	          someone tell me?

	          -- Where is she?
	
	                    MAC
	          -- She's by the fountain.
	
	                    GUEST 3
	          -- Simone, over here!
	
	                    GUEST 4
	          -- Simone!
	
	The rumor races through the party like wild-fire.  The GUESTS
	surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
	
	The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
	
	                    LOOKALIKE WOMAN
	          Simone!
	
	She gets knocked into the fountain.  Several other GUESTS
	also fall in the stampede.
	
	Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
	his station.  Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.

	The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
	with ambulances.  PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
	battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".

	              (into microphone)
	          -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
	          big news tonight was the surprise
	          appearance of Simone.  Even these
	          seen-it-all superstars are
	          apparently not immune to Simone
	          fever and the resulting stampede
	          forced organizers to bring the
	          event to an early end.  I spoke
	          with some of the departing guests
	          about their encounter with
	          Hollywood's most reluctant
	          superstar.
	
	CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- I would say, even more beautiful
	          in person, you have to see her to
	          believe her.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 1
	          -- I can't reveal what we spoke
	          about.  It was... personal.  Simone
	          and I go back a long way.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 1
	          -- When she talks to you, for that
	          moment, you are the only other
	          human being in the room.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 2
	              (dress torn)
	          -- I really don't know what the
	          fuss is about.  So over-rated. 
	          She's done one film.  Talk to me
	          when she's had the kind of career
	          I've had.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 2
	          -- I do expect her to be nominated,
	          yes.

	          Fortunately, Simone was not amongst
	          the injured and was spirited away
	          as mysteriously as she arrived.
	
	EXT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building.
	
	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated.  He paces back
	and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- She goes to a major, Hollywood,
	          A-list party and we don't get an
	          interview, a comment, we don't even
	          get a photograph?  Is that what
	          you're telling me?
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Nobody got a photograph.  Nobody
	          ever gets a photograph.
	
	                    MILTON
	          We've got our best people on it,
	          Mr. Sayer.
	
	                    MAX
	          24-hour tail on Taransky?
	
	                    MILTON
	          Shutter bugs camped outside any
	          place he goes, every concierge and
	          maitre d' on the take.  But this
	          Simone woman is good.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to a
	               "Confidential" FBI
	               report)
	          Obviously the name isn't real --
	          she's using an assumed identity,
	          travels under a false name, checks
	          into hotels with an alias.  She
	          never stays in the same place two
	          nights in a row.  Anything on the
	          satellite photos?
	              (irritated)
	          What about the fingerprints?  What
	          happened when we dusted that hotel
	          suite?
	
	MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Well, we got some of Taransky's
	          fingerprints, a lot of your
	          fingerprints... but none of hers.
	
	                    MAX
	              (interest piqued)
	          Which means they're significant.
	              (beat)
	          Incriminating.
	              (beat)
	          Perhaps, criminal.
	              (getting excited)
	          She's hiding her past.  She's
	          hiding her past.
	
	Max ponders the revelation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Of course -- no one's that perfect,
	          that pure.  You know I had
	          something on Mother Teresa.  But
	          then she died and it wasn't worth
	          it anymore.
	              (approaching a computer)
	          I know how to flush out this Simone
	          -- a tell-all story from her
	          childhood.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (impressed)
	          My God, you've got one?
	
	                    MAX
	              (offering Milton a seat in
	               front of the computer)
	          I will when you're finished writing
	          it.
	
	MILTON hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	              (disappointed in his
	               protege)
	          Am I wasting my time with you? 
	          When she sues to protect her
	          privacy, she'll have to appear in a
	          public courtroom to do it.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (under his breath)
	          Long live the First Amendment.
	
	                    MAX
	          Sometimes you have to tell a small
	          lie to get to the bigger truth.
	              (to his nervous
	               photographer)
	          As for a photo -- if you can't do
	          it, I know twelve million people
	          who can.
	
	CLOSE UP on The Echo magazine -- "CIRCULATION - 12 MILLION".
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the
	headline on the cover of The ECHO.  VIKTOR is reading the
	magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
	
	He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
	soundstage.  A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
	trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".  VIKTOR runs towards
	the door, throwing himself between the door and the
	executives.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- You can't go in there!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- We know she's in there!
	
	Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (struggling to hold them
	               back)
	          -- Why?  What's all this about?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (waving a spreadsheet)
	          -- We've got the tracking numbers
	          for "Eternity Forever".
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- They're in the toilet.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- She has to get out there and
	          sell the film.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- What do you want her to do, go
	          door-to-door -- ?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- Even Garbo would be on the talk
	          show circuit if she was alive
	          today.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated)
	          -- It's precisely because she
	          doesn't crave the limelight that
	          people love her.  I told you, she's
	          only about the work.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- This is over-shadowing the work!
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (waving the front page of
	               The Echo)
	          That's the problem.  She's more
	          famous for her no-shows than her
	          shows.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- It's starting to look like she
	          doesn't support the film or you,
	          Viktor.
	              (trying to squeeze past
	               Viktor)
	          If you can't handle her, I will.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blocking her path)
	          Not now.  She's emotional.  Her
	          mother dies today.  Scene forty-two
	          of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a
	          good time.
	
	Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
	Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Please, don't go in there!
	
	Too late.  Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted
	with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the
	vast soundstage.  A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          Where is she?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          She's not here.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine... I...
	
	Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing
	smile.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          So, the secret's finally out,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I can explain.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I don't think that's necessary. 
	          I think it's perfectly clear.  I
	          should have guessed -- it all makes
	          sense now... it's why she never
	          goes anywhere, never seen in
	          public...
	
	Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She's into computers.
	
	Viktor looks up.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (nodding in agreement)
	          Probably spends her whole life in
	          chat rooms.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's the one place she can be
	          herself.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          Anonymous.
	
	Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (adopting a serious tone)
	          It's worse than you think.  She's
	          extremely agoraphobic -- has a
	          morbid fear of people and germs. 
	          In a way I'm relieved you... found
	          out.
	
	The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The premiere was the first time
	          I've convinced her to venture out
	          and it just confirmed her worst
	          nightmares.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned)
	          Viktor, you should have said
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She doesn't want pity.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (seeing a new side of
	               Viktor)
	          You're so good to protect her like
	          this.
	
	Viktor shrugs modestly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the Executives,
	               conceding)
	          I'll tell you what.  I know how
	          much this means to you.  I'll try
	          to get her to plug the film.
	              (beat)
	          I'm not promising anything but
	          maybe she'll do a talk show --
	          taped.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. 
	          She'll never go to them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          We understand.  Thank you, Viktor.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          Give her our best.
	
	Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the
	soundstage.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (aside to a colleague)
	          That agoraphobia -- it's like a
	          plague.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's out of control in Europe.
	
	Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
	          introduce you to Simone at the
	          premiere.  There wasn't time with
	          the riot and everything.
	              (picking up a framed photo
	               from the work station)
	          But she wanted you to have this.
	
	The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the
	premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was there.  She didn't by any
	          chance happen to mention me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She said you were very beautiful.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (flattered)
	          Really?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blurting out)
	          Elaine, what are you doing tonight? 
	          Would you like to go somewhere --
	          dinner?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to.  But aren't you
	          supposed to meet up with Simone?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I
	          always?
	
	Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
	
	Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National
	ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF
	SIMONE"!  Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX
	SAYER.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods
	aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.
	
	We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while
	at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV. 
	However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart.  She wears
	sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf.  Simone takes
	a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of
	cereal off a display.
	
	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER watches the video in his office, enraptured.  He
	rewinds the tape and replays the moment.
	
	                    MAX
	          She likes Apple Jacks... just like
	          me...
	
	Assistant MILTON enters.  He looks ill.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer...
	
	                    MAX
	              (irritated at being
	               interrupted)
	          What do you want -- ?
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million
	          bucks yet?
	
	                    MAX
	              (never averting his eyes
	               from the screen)
	          -- Cashier's check went out to our
	          anonymous tipster this morning --
	          worth every penny too.  Who says
	          there's no place for checkbook
	          journalism?  We'll be running
	          stills of this for months, then
	          release the whole tape -- we'll get
	          our money back -- maybe show it on
	          an exclusive pay-per-view event. 
	          Do you realize what we have here? 
	          We have the only independent
	          footage of Simone in existence.
	
	                    MILTON
	          We used to.
	
	Max's head snaps around.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (holding a copy of the
	               L.A. Times Calendar
	               section - "Simone Live")
	          She's doing Frank Brand on
	          Thursday.
	
	Max coughs.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get out.
	
	A TV
	
	The opening credits to "FRANK BRAND LIVE", a global cable
	show plays against a starscape -- images of famous
	politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank.

	              (to camera)
	          Tonight on Frank Brand Live --
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's
	mansion with eager anticipation.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Since taking the nation by storm
	          with her debut movie, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset"...
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          ... no one's managed to land a live
	          TV interview with the fabulous, new
	          shooting starlet, Simone... until
	          now.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
	from The ECHO.
	
	VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
	final test of his equipment.  When he touches his hair, bats
	his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
	
	VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
	SIMONE from a library of images.  Rainforest.  Desert.  Ritzy
	hotel suite.  Moonscape.  Factory.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Make up your mind, Viktor.  Make up
	          your mind.
	
	He settles on the desert location.
	
	He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --
	selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          I'm happy to say she's agreed to
	          join us tonight from the set of her
	          new film.
	              (turning to the TV
	               monitor)
	          Welcome, Simone.
	
	The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's
	monitor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that
	Elaine is in the room.
	
	                    KENT
	          She is all woman.
	
	LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look.  She
	gets up and leaves the room.
	
	During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,
	Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including
	Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide
	locations --
	
	A)  A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
	
	B)  A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
	
	C)  A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well, no one could accuse you of
	          being over-exposed, Simone.  Why
	          have you stayed so completely out
	          of the limelight?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (shrugs)
	          I just think actors talk too much. 
	          Does the world really want to hear
	          your life story just because you've
	          got a movie opening Friday?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Of course, the only problem with
	          shying away from publicity these
	          days is that it tends to attract
	          more.
	
	VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
	frighteningly convincing.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Don't I know it.  That's the only
	          reason I'm here now -- to put the
	          attention back where it belongs, on
	          Mr. Taransky's film.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          You don't secretly want the
	          attention?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm not even sure I deserve it. 
	          After tonight I'll have almost as
	          much screen time on your show as I
	          do in my movies.  How is that
	          healthy for a performer?
	
	IE.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to
	look through a book.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Because, you have to understand,
	          Frank, these interviews -- none of
	          this is real.  Who I am on screen
	          and who I really am are two totally
	          different people.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Who are you really?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          That's a good question.
	              (beat)
	          As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man
	          strives long and hard to appear
	          someone else..."
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reading from a bookmarked
	               page, along with Simone)
	          "... he ends up finding it is
	          difficult to be himself again."
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well put.
	
	Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor
	Taransky".
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
	leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
	
	                    MAX
	              (focusing on the desert
	               background behind Simone)
	          I know where that is... I know...
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Change of topic.  Simone, you've
	          been romantically linked to dozens
	          of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,
	          Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...
	          and most recently Viktor Taransky. 
	          Is there a Mr. Right in there
	          somewhere?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'd rather not discuss my private
	          life.
	              (gently)
	          But Viktor and I are inseparable.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.
	
	                    KENT
	          You dog, Viktor!
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          I literally wouldn't be here today
	          without him.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
	excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command.  SIMONE'S
	EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Would you like a moment, Simone?
	
	Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
	startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          No, I'm okay.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Let's talk about the work that you
	          care so much about.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Sure.  Where would you like to
	          start?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          How about the nudity?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Nudity has just never been an issue
	          for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are
	          just an option.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          What exactly was it that attracted
	          you to your first two projects?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (unable to resist a smile)
	          I suppose the thing I like most
	          about the movies I'm in is that
	          they're not about special effects.
	
	Frank nods sagely.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          They're better for it if I may say.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking
	alert:
	
	        !!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
	
	The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.  Curiously, it
	is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	              (regarding the screen)
	          Well, we appear to be experiencing
	          satellite difficulties.  In case we
	          lose you, Simone, I want to thank
	          you --
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Thank... YOU, FRANK.
	
	In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.  The feed goes
	blank on Frank Brand's screen.
	
	VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion.  Since SIMONE
	is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
	Simone also slumps.
	
	Viktor's cell phone rings.  Viktor picks up.
	
	                    VIKTOR / SIMONE
	          Hel--
	
	He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
	synthesizer.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          Hello.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
	the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
	TV.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, are you with her?  Is
	          she there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.
	
	An anxious beat.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Are you and Simone...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... getting married?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (taken aback by the
	               suggestion)
	          No, of course not!
	              (realizing the
	               significance of the
	               question)
	          Why?  Would you care if we were?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (covering, realizing she
	               has given herself away)
	          Well, yes.  From a studio point of
	          view, it would be better if Simone
	          stayed single.
	              (quick change of topic)
	          Anyhow, I thought she came across
	          great tonight.  Intelligent, well
	          informed, a natural.  And touching. 
	          She was spectacular.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	
	A pause.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, do you realize you always
	          do that?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do what?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whenever I compliment Simone, you
	          take the credit.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I do?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes, you do...
	              (shrug)
	          Anyway, tonight was a good start.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excuse me?  Start?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's a crowded summer.  We need
	          every photo-opp, sound-byte and
	          column inch we can get.  Good
	          night, Viktor.
	
	Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (carefully broaching the
	               subject)
	          Mom, do you miss Dad?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (she thinks)
	          Sometimes.  But, just when I think
	          your father's changing for the
	          better, I realize he's as self
	          absorbed as ever.  He took the
	          credit for Simone tonight.
	
	Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
	Nietzsche book in her hand.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I think Dad deserves more credit
	          than he gets.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen.  He is unusually anxious.
	
	As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
	she awaits instructions on the screen.  For some reason
	Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Simone)
	          Will you cover yourself up!?
	
	He hits a button.  A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
	
	EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
	
	The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
	desert.  MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've been here before! -- On my
	          honeymoon with my ex-wife.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Is that why she left you?
	
	Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
	interview.  He compares her desert location to the one in
	front of him.
	
	                    MAX
	              (pointing out a Joshua
	               tree)
	          You see, that's the exact same tree
	          and in the distance, there's the...
	              (voice trailing away)
	          ... mountain.
	
	Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
	now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
	
	Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
	
	                    MILTON
	          It's a hotel.
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't understand.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Could they have built that hotel
	          since yesterday?
	
	Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get in the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
	publicity machine.  The floor is littered with photographs of
	SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
	
	Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
	constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
	spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular
	Mechanics".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (angrily into phone)
	          -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
	          don't get the cover... written
	          answers to written questions,
	          that's right... website interviews,
	          no problem.
	
	Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION".  Choosing from a HULA
	DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
	Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. 
	She begins to dance for him.
	
	He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
	SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
	
	He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
	With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
	beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (muttering to himself)
	          You want exposure, Elaine?  I'll
	          give you over-exposure...
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
	
	ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change channels
	without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
	answers.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think "Eternity Forever" is my
	          finest work.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm most proud of my work in
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think people are going to love
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" costume.  He speaks to the photo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Forgive me, Simone.
	
	EXT.  FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
	
	The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
	cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
	Meals.  Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
	in a convertible.

	         "ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!
	
	Screams the banner headline in "Variety".
	
	            $$$IMONE - WINS 6TH WEEKEND IN A ROW
	
	Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
	
	The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR
	who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly
	at Simone.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Of course, being a movie star is
	          wonderful, but I have so many other
	          ways I want to express myself --
	
	INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY
	
	Various book titles are on display:
	
	            "SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"
	
	            "HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"
	
	                 "SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"
	
	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
	
	A banner in a window reads.  "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
	FASHION".  Mannequins model the clothes.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
	
	  SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
	
	  PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
	
	A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly
	appears on the screen along with photographs of the
	artists --
	
	PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,
	CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title
	of each song is a graphic representation of the music --
	"PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
	
	Viktor presses a button: "MORPH".  The audio waves converge.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song. 
	As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
	sings.  The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".
	
	SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
	
	INT.  RECORD STORE - DAY
	
	The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside
	the record store.  TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance
	adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are
	gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
	
	INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
	shoots up the Billboard charts.
	
	EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
	luxury yacht.
	
	VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
	a moment to savor his success.  Simone's hit single plays on
	the yacht's stereo.  He looks at peace.
	
	EXT.  MARINA - DAY
	
	A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
	taken.  However, we discover that the Simone is only a
	lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
	snapshots.  He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
	ELVIS.
	
	MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
	
	Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
	sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice boat, Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's a yacht.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know what you're up to.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pushing past Max)
	          I don't have time for this, Sayer.
	
	                    MAX
	          I think you do.
	              (holding up his video
	               print of Simone in the
	               desert)
	          I know it's a fake.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    MAX
	          Got your attention now?
	
	Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
	with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to the
	               photographs)
	          It's bogus.  You used an old
	          library shot for the background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen)
	          The background is.
	
	                    MAX
	          She was never in New Mexico.  She
	          never left the studio.
	
	Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
	the background.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to a large
	               bundle of other shots
	               under his arm)
	          I've done my homework.  I've
	          studied her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I bet you have.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've looked at every piece of
	          publicity she's ever done, the
	          video in the supermarket, there's
	          no evidence she's ever left the
	          studio.
	              (afterthought)
	          Oh, and for some reason this woman
	          leaves no paper trail.  But I have
	          "obtained" a copy of your bank
	          accounts.  I know you have power of
	          attorney but so far you haven't
	          transferred one single solitary
	          cent to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm keeping it in trust.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know that's what you'd like us to
	          believe.  But I got to tell you --
	          embezzlement is a serious matter. 
	          Not to mention abduction.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Abduction?
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't buy the whole recluse scam. 
	          How are you doing it?  What is it --
	          drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? 
	          All three?  What do you do -- keep
	          her locked in a box somewhere?
	
	Viktor flinches at the remark.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	          I want to see her.  Unless you show
	          me Simone live and in person I show
	          these pictures to the authorities.
	
	Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
	
	                    MAX
	          Er,... good.
	
	                    MILTON
	          That's good.
	
	Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
	
	The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
	into the sea.
	
	INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
	
	A vast, empty stadium.  On the stage, a lone microphone. 
	VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena.  Several
	PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          All ready, Mr. Taransky.  This time
	          tomorrow night, she'll be standing
	          right here in front of a packed
	          house.  We could have sold it out
	          twenty times.
	
	Viktor nods.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	          Soundcheck went perfect.  Laser
	          show ready to go.
	              (cautionary note)
	          I gotta say, you ordered an awful
	          lot of smoke.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's the way she likes it.
	
	The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,
	where a barrier has been erected.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          After what you told us about the
	          death threats, the security guards
	          are under strict instructions never
	          to take their eyes off the crowd.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excellent.
	
	Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a
	kiss.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone wanted you to have these.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	              (visibly moved by the
	               gesture)
	          Wish her luck from us.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, I will.
	              (afterthought)
	          Remember, no cameras, no
	          binoculars.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
	truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
	from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck.  The
	control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation
	Tour.  NO ENTRY".
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.  On
	his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his
	jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.
	
	SIMONE appears on the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let's get you into hair and make
	          up.
	
	Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes
	grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints
	across the lids.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Wardrobe.
	
	Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes
	appearing to fabricate themselves on her body.  He settles
	for the most provocative outfit.
	
	Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor
	showing --
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands,
	stomping their feet and chanting.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Easier to make one hundred thousand
	          believe than just one.
	
	He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the
	"ENTER" key.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	Smoke fills the stage.  A strobe light show plays.  A booming
	ANNOUNCER is heard.
	
	                    ANNOUNCER
	          Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor
	          Taransky Promotions is proud to
	          present, live on stage, for the
	          debut concert of the "Splendid
	          Isolation" tour, the one, the only,
	          SI-MONE!
	
	A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
	alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
	accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage.  However, on
	closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
	creating a hologram.  Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
	the illusion.
	
	The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
	the enormous video screens on either side of the stage.  The
	CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that
	they are watching a pre-recorded event.  Some watch the event
	on portable TVs.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	CLOSE UP on the computer screen.  VIKTOR scrolls down a list
	of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from on stage)
	          I love you...
	
	He selects "L.A.".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... L.A.
	
	The crowd roars its approval.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          It's great to be here.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --
	begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".  A verse of the song is sung in
	perfect Spanish.
	
	EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
	
	A)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
	
	B)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to
	    SIMONE.
	
	C)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his
	    passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
	crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
	tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
	aloft.  For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
	the grand illusionist.  Viktor is at the height of his
	powers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the image of Simone on
	               his screen)
	          I don't know about you, Simone, but
	          I've never felt more alive.
	
	He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the
	Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
	stand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn!
	
	He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the
	TV screen, apparently fails to notice.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER.  His
	journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing
	along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept
	up in the moment.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE finishes her final number.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Good-night.  Never stop believing.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
	
	A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars. 
	FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
	
	S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE
	BOYS.  Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"
	T-shirts and carry posters.  Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a
	TV NEWS CREW.
	
	                    FAN 1
	          -- I swear, she looked right at me.
	
	                    FAN 2
	          -- She was, like, ethereal.
	
	                    FAN 3
	          -- One moment she seemed to walk
	          right through her mike stand like
	          it wasn't even there.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	The chanting crowd can be heard exiting.  VIKTOR, wearing
	lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with
	Simone's signature kiss.
	
	He is interrupted by a knock at the door.  Viktor irritably
	opens it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I said I didn't want to be
	          interrupt --
	
	EXT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a
	SECURITY GUARD nearby.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (face brightening)
	          My two favorite girls.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Lainey and I just wanted to
	          congratulate...
	
	Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          ... Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (suddenly cool)
	          I can imagine.
	
	Viktor is confused by their reaction.  Elaine yanks Lainey
	away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank Simone for the tickets.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (calling back as she is
	               led away)
	          It was a great show, Dad...
	
	Viktor waves disconcertedly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Where are you... going?
	
	As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
	lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
	trailer door.  He slams the side of the trailer in
	frustration.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-
	runs of the SIMONE concert.  KENT cannot take his eyes off
	the screen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't believe she's doing this --
	          taking advantage of him this way. 
	          It's cruel.
	
	                    KENT
	          Why?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Obviously, this can't last.  She's
	          going to dump him.  Viktor won't be
	          able to take that.  He's too
	          sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
	
	                    KENT
	          Elaine, do you realize you can't
	          stop talking about Viktor?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (not hearing)
	          I have to talk to her.
	
	Kent switches off the TV.
	
	                    KENT
	          I've been meaning to talk to you.
	
	Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
	at the breaking waves.  LAINEY joins him.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hey, Lainey.
	              (gently teasing her)
	          How's your love life?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do okay.  How about you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know me -- married to my work.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I noticed.
	
	An awkward silence.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, you know I don't like to get
	          between you and mom but she's
	          feeling down right now.  She broke
	          up with Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (buoyed by the news)
	          Really?  Too bad.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She thinks you're with Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
	          have a real relationship.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if
	          it came from Simone, if Simone
	          spoke to Mom -- she could
	          straighten things out.
	              (shrug)
	          Dinner, maybe.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A
	          phone call?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Too impersonal.  They have to meet
	          face-to-face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll see what I can do.
	              (a thought occurs)
	          You know, Lainey.  I don't believe
	          you've ever once asked to meet
	          Simone.  Don't you like her?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love her but that doesn't mean I
	          need to meet her.
	
	Viktor is confused.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?  So I can tell my friends at
	          school -- as if that validates my
	          life somehow.  What's Simone going
	          to say to a fourteen-year-old
	          anyhow?  She's going to be polite
	          because you're my father but we're
	          not suddenly going to become
	          friends -- we have nothing in
	          common.  It's not going to be real. 
	          Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
	          my head every day.  Why kill the
	          dream?  What do they say, "don't
	          get too close to your idols, they
	          always disappoint you".
	
	Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
	her years.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I love you, Lainey.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love you too, daddy.
	
	A car horn sounds outside the house.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          That's Mom.
	              (kissing him on the
	               forehead)
	          See you.
	
	She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.
	
	EXT.  LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
	
	Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car
	radio.  ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along
	the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Her car phone
	rings.  She turns down the radio and picks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Hello?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Hello, is this Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you,
	          Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk
	          to you.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Well, here I am.
	              (beat)
	          You look pretty today.  Red suits
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (looking around the
	               freeway)
	          Where are you?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Right beside you.  I borrowed
	          Viktor's car.
	
	Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
	phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewhat
	mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as they
	talk.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the
	driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
	mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
	
	Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the
	car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
	with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
	ahead.  He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm
	          late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor
	          now.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No, I understand.  That's what I
	          want to talk about.  I don't know
	          if you know this, Simone, but
	          Viktor and I were married once.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I can't imagine how you ever let a
	          man like that go.  I owe Viktor
	          everything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I think he owes more to you.  But
	          that's not important now.  I know
	          what's going on between you two.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I want to reassure you, Elaine,
	          there's absolutely nothing going on
	          between Viktor and I.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rueful smile)
	          You don't have to protect my
	          feelings, Simone.  I don't blame
	          Viktor for falling in love with the
	          most desirable woman in the world.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (breaking character)
	          I'm not --
	              (correcting himself)
	          He's not.
	
	Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across
	his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at
	the last second.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          My God, are you alright, Simone?
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Damn --
	              (struggling to stay in
	               her/his lane)
	          Yes -- I --
	              (regaining control)
	          -- I'm just a little tired. 
	          Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --
	          it's strictly a working
	          relationship.  We could never be
	          anything else.  We're just so...
	          different.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  You're a household name
	          now.  You're moving in entirely
	          different worlds.  That's why I
	          hope you're not toying with Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          It sounds like you still have
	          feelings for him.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We have a daughter together.  I
	          just don't want to see Viktor get
	          hurt.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I don't know how many times I have
	          to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and
	          I are not in love.
	              (joking weakly)
	          I only make love to the camera.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone, I recognize the shirt
	          you're wearing.  I gave it to
	          Viktor on his birthday.
	
	Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next
	lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
	to avoid him.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Christ --
	              (still struggling to stay
	               on the road)
	          Elaine, I know how it looks but...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... it would mean a lot to Viktor
	          if you'd go with him to the Oscars. 
	          If you won't do it for him, please
	          do it for me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (reluctant, frightened by
	               Simone's erratic driving)
	          Okay -- for you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (sigh of relief)
	          Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm glad we talked.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good-bye.
	
	Viktor's car swerves to the right.  Elaine looks back in her
	rearview mirror, concerned.
	
	Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the
	truck in front of him.
	
	EXT.  FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
	
	VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the
	fender-bender.  However, the Patrolman is more interested in
	the Simone mannequin.
	
	                    PATROLMAN
	          You don't have to explain.  I know
	          what the press is like.  Lunatics. 
	          Out of control.
	              (referring to the Simone
	               mannequin)
	          You do know I'm going to have to
	          take this?
	
	INT.  ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed
	auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE". 
	ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.
	
	HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best
	Actress" envelope.
	
	                    HAL
	          And the winner is...
	
	Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he
	reads the name.
	
	                    HAL
	          Actually, there's a tie.
	
	The AUDIENCE gasps.
	
	                    HAL
	              (milking the moment for
	               all it's worth)
	          The winners are... Simone for
	          "Sunrise, Sunset"...
	
	The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their
	applause.
	
	                    HAL
	              (big smile)
	          ... and Simone for "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	The audience erupts.  Viktor accepts the congratulations of
	those around him.
	
	                    HAL
	          Unfortunately, Simone can't be with
	          us tonight.
	              (turning to the screen)
	          But thanks to the miracle of modern
	          technology she is able to join us
	          live via satellite from the
	          location of her new film.
	
	The screen flickers to life.
	
	ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY
	
	SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland
	location chosen by Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Thank you!  Thank you!  This means
	          so much to me.  I'm just sorry I
	          can't be there with you.
	              (wiping away a tear)
	          First off I have to acknowledge my
	          fellow nominees -- I don't even
	          feel I belong in the best actress
	          category let alone with these...
	          wonderful human beings.
	              (composing herself)
	          I also have to thank my co-stars,
	          the studio, of course.  But most of
	          all, I have to thank the audience
	          for supporting what I do -- you're
	          the only reason I'm here.
	
	The CROWD applauds wildly.
	
	LAINEY is puzzled.  She leans over to Viktor.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why didn't she thank you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          She did... didn't she?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (crestfallen)
	          No.
	
	Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him.  The blood
	drains from his face.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING
	
	On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the
	speech.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... And of course I must thank my
	          collaborator, Viktor Taransky,
	          without whom none of this would be
	          possible.
	
	VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen. 
	He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          It's written right there... Why
	          didn't I say it?... How could I
	          forget to say it?
	
	Simone stares back at him blankly.
	
	A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door.  The
	front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At
	Oscars".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home.  MAX is
	standing outside next to his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn it!
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
	the car, MILTON closeby.  Viktor stops at the gate and
	reluctantly exits his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What now, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	              (smug smile, noticing
	               Viktor noticing the
	               woman)
	          Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No
	          one comes from nowhere, Taransky. 
	          You turn over enough rocks...
	
	The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
	
	                    MAX
	          I traced her to a nursing home.  A
	          young woman fitting Simone's
	          description dropped her off five
	          years ago.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She looks a lot like you.
	
	                    MAX
	              (undeterred)
	          She hasn't uttered a word that
	          whole time -- until she saw the big
	          show.
	
	Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Simone's
	               picture, catatonic)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	                    MAX
	              (putting his hand on his
	               heart)
	          Who would think that "Saint Simone"
	          would abandon her own mother?  I've
	          been looking into the family
	          history -- heartbreaking.  Most
	          likely a biography to run over four
	          issues... who knows, maybe there's
	          a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
	
	Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Viktor's face
	               on the driver's license)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
	
	                    MAX
	          That doesn't prove a thing -- wait
	          until I get a court order for a
	          blood test.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sensing an opportunity)
	          That won't be necessary.
	              (pretending to be
	               resigned)
	          Sooner or later I knew you'd crack
	          this thing, Max.  You got me.
	
	                    MAX
	          I do?
	              (recovering)
	          Sure I do.
	              (taking Viktor aside)
	          Can we speak off the record?  I'm a
	          fair man.  I'm willing to sit down
	          with her and tell her side of the
	          story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I wouldn't want you to compromise
	          your ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	          No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
	
	Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You love her, don't you, Max?
	
	                    MAX
	          Don't you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (writes a check, hands it
	               to Max)
	          This should take care of Mother.
	
	Viktor drives into his home.  Max, very confused, stares at
	the old lady.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his
	soundstage.  He removes the blindfold.  From Lainey's point-
	of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you
	          like it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (taking in the car)
	          It's fantastic -- it's too much.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the car she drove in "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know.  Thank her for me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (disappointed by her
	               reaction)
	          It's from both of us.  Of course
	          you'll have to drive it around the
	          lot until you get your permit --
	
	Lainey averts her gaze.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I can't accept it.  I don't want
	          a car, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (clearly hurt, not
	               understanding)
	          Why not?  I can get you something
	          else.  What do you want?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          The old Viktor Taransky.
	              (finally blurting it out)
	          I liked you better before -- before
	          all this.  You were a loser, Dad,
	          but at least you had integrity.  I
	          can't stand to see you like this --
	          clinging to Simone's coattails --
	          it used to be about the work, and
	          now it's all about her.  And then
	          she's not even grateful enough to
	          thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, that was me.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          There you go again, blaming
	          yourself.  Can't you see what she's
	          done to you -- she's taking
	          advantage, mocking you.  You
	          deserve better than Simone.
	              (hasty exit)
	          I've got to go, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey...
	
	Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's
	remarks.  JANE enters.
	
	                    JANE
	          Ready for your casting session?
	
	Viktor nods distractedly.  Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	                    JANE
	          Nicola's here for the role of
	          Simone's sister.
	
	Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has
	never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
	Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (slightly uncomfortable by
	               Viktor's scrutiny)
	          A lot's happened since we last saw
	          each other.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (numb)
	          Yes.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          I never apologized properly for
	          what happened on "Sunrise".
	
	She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &
	Ike candy, including cherry.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  It's not important.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          After I saw what Simone did with
	          the role -- you know I fired all my
	          people, went into rehab, took
	          acting classes, changed my whole
	          look.  She really inspired me.
	
	Viktor continues to stare.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (referring to the script
	               in her hands)
	          Would you like me to read?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, I'd like that.
	
	Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down. 
	She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the
	scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (her angry words are in
	               opposition to her amorous
	               actions)
	          -- Who do you think you are, Carlos
	          -- coming in here like this?  With
	          my husband sleeping in the next
	          room.  Do you think I won't call
	          out?  Do you think I will just give
	          in to you without a fight -- like
	          the last time and the time before
	          that?
	              (she kisses his ear)
	          I wish you were dead.
	              (she kisses his lips)
	          I wish we were both dead.
	
	Nicola immediately breaks character.
	
	Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
	flesh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (finally able to speak)
	          You know you're really very good. 
	          I take back what I said.  I mean,
	          you're really good.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (forgetting himself)
	          You could play the lead.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (confused)
	          But that's Simone's part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course it is.
	              (gazing at her face)
	          You know you have a line here.  Not
	          a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a
	          dimple.  I've been thinking of
	          incorporating something like that
	          in Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (incredulous)
	          You'd cosmetically alter Simone to
	          look like me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, of course not, you're right. 
	          That would be crazy.
	
	Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Do you want me to do it again?
	
	Viktor does not reply.  Nicola quietly leaves.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
	photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
	satellite.  However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
	picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
	Ceremony.
	
	Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
	
	EXT.  SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
	
	Old home video of ELAINE.  She is in a garden by a swimming
	pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera. 
	Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
	operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
	kiss to the camera.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
	Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
	monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
	
	Viktor freezes the tape.  Elaine appears particularly
	beautiful.
	
	Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
	it into Simone.  Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
	dazzling smile.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle
	as she talks on the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone)
	          -- Oh sure, she comes in all the
	          time... we've become close.  She
	          told me --
	
	VIKTOR enters the office.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Jane --
	
	Jane hurriedly hangs up.
	
	                    JANE
	          Gotta go.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (picking up a pile of
	               scripts from the in-tray)
	          I'm leaving early tonight.  If you
	          need me I'll be at the beach house
	          having dinner with a... certain
	          someone.
	
	Jane tries to conceal her interest.  As soon as Viktor exits
	the office, JANE picks up the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone, under her
	               breath)
	          ... Elaine Christian please.
	
	We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
	assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.  The doorbell
	rings.
	
	He checks himself in the mirror.  In the reflection, he spies
	an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE. 
	He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
	
	ELAINE stands there.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
	
	Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, it's Wednesday.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (feigning absent
	               mindedness)
	          Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. 
	          How embarrassing.  I don't know
	          what I was thinking.  With all the
	          excitement lately...
	              (peering past him)
	          Am I interrupting something?  Are
	          you expecting company?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ushering her inside)
	          As a matter-of-fact I am.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          When is she coming over?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to his watch)
	          About now.  Would you like a drink?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I suppose I could stay, just until
	          she arrives.
	
	Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glass of
	wine and sits beside her -- close.
	
	They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
	apparently in need of courage.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to make
	               conversation)
	          Is Simone back to earth yet?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. 
	          She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
	              (blurting out)
	          Is she really having your baby?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Impossible.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (instantly regretting the
	               remark)
	          I just read somewhere --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know.  I know.  They'll say
	          anything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- And she was positively glowing
	          at the awards.
	              (making to leave)
	          I should be going, she'll be here
	          soon --
	
	Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She already is.  Simone's not
	          coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight,
	          not ever.
	              (holding her)
	          I want you back, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (melting)
	          I want you back too, Viktor.
	
	They kiss.  Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with
	doubt.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? 
	          I can't compete with Simone.  What
	          woman can?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I would rather have you than
	          Simone.  Believe me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's sweet, Viktor, but I
	          couldn't let you do that -- make
	          that kind of sacrifice.
	              (meeting his gaze)
	          It's strange.  I've stabbed people
	          in the back, clawed and slept my
	          way to where I am -- it goes with
	          the territory -- but, for some
	          reason, I can't betray Simone. 
	          There's... I don't know any other
	          way to say it -- there's a goodness
	          to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, there isn't.  There's nothing
	          to her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, Viktor.  You say that now --
	          because we're here, alone, like
	          this.  But in the morning, you'd go
	          back to her.  What man wouldn't?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, I will end my relationship with
	          her -- totally.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          But you don't understand.  She'll
	          always be there -- at some party,
	          on some magazine cover, some song
	          on the radio, up on some screen.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (desperate)
	          No.  She'll never work again --
	          retire, never make a movie or a
	          record, or appear ever again.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Of course she will.  Her public
	          will demand it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not if I don't let her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You?
	
	Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm going to tell you a secret now,
	          Elaine.
	              (mustering all his nerve)
	          Simone is not a real person.  I
	          invented her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (misinterpreting his
	               remark)
	          Every actor is an invention,
	          Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. 
	          No one's denying that you
	          discovered Simone.  But it's like
	          finding a diamond in the desert. 
	          Anyone can trip over it, but it's
	          not the finder who sparkles.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (agitated)
	          -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. 
	          You don't understand --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring him)
	          -- You just got lucky that she's
	          loyal enough to stay with you. 
	          Maybe she's staying out of pity,
	          who knows?  She certainly doesn't
	          need you.  Some people even say
	          you're holding her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (wounded)
	          Who says that -- ?
	              (shaking off the insult)
	          -- Never mind.  You have to listen
	          to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air,
	          pixels, molded by me from a
	          mathematical equation.  I inherited
	          it from a madman -- I can show
	          you --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How much wine have you had?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She's a figment of my own
	          imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky,
	          have perpetrated the greatest hoax,
	          the greatest sleight-of-hand,
	          sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
	          sleight in entertainment history!
	          And still no one appreciates me,
	          recognizes what I've done -- even
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)
	          You're drunker than I thought.  Are
	          you doing that again?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Whatever talent Simone has
	          comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear,
	          as God is my judge.  You don't know
	          what I've been through.  Tens of
	          thousands of mind-numbing hours in
	          front of that screen, nights
	          without end, and look what it's
	          cost me.
	              (producing his spectacles)
	          Why do you think I've been wearing
	          these?  I may have done irreparable
	          harm to my eyesight, and why?  To
	          extract and refine the infinite
	          nuances of a human being -- a human
	          soul.
	              (a final explanation)
	          Don't you see?  I made Simone!
	
	A pause.  His words hang in the air.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You made Simone?
	              (a trace of pity)
	          Viktor, she made you.
	
	Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
	alone in his house.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office.  Suddenly, he stops and
	confronts the standee of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You bitch!  I'll destroy you!
	
	JANE stares in shock.  She discreetly exits.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
	SIMONE.  He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
	
	MONTAGE:
	
	A)  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
	    VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash.  Max finds a
	    beat up reel of 16mm film.
	
	    MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
	
	B)  The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
	    shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
	    compromising position.
	
	    VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
	    overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          Disgusting...
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	              (sympathetic)
	          She must have been so desperate to
	          do something like that, so
	          depraved.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          I'm still naming my baby after her.
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	          You're having a boy.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          So?
	
	    Viktor blanches.  It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
	
	C)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
	
	    ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
	    farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
	    for muddy vegetables.
	
	    The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
	    spontaneous applause.
	
	    Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
	    "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
	
	D)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
	    behind him.
	
	                    FILM CRITIC
	          For Simone to do something as brave
	          as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
	          career, with so much to lose -- all
	          I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
	          Oscar".
	
	E)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
	    wrinkles to Simone.
	
	F)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
	    on a TV screen.  However, her squeaky-clean image has
	    gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
	    during the interview.  The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
	
	                    HOST
	          Simone, that's a rather
	          controversial position.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I just think all elementary schools
	          should have a firing range -- so
	          students can learn how to defend
	          themselves.  We could fit it
	          inbetween recess and American
	          History.
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          If there's a hole in the ozone
	          layer why can't I see it?
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Immigration?!  God, isn't it
	          crowded enough?!
	
	                    HOSTS
	          Just as we always knew.  Simone's
	          not like other celebrities.  She
	          speaks her mind!
	
	G)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
	    brakes, almost causing an accident.  He stares numbly up
	    at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
	    billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE.  It
	    reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          She's trying to kill me.
	
	Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
	
	EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
	
	An inscription on a headstone reads:
	
	                         HANK ALENO
	                Remembered Virtually Forever
	
	VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.  He places a bunch of flowers
	there.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the flowers)
	          They're plastic, Hank.  I know
	          that's the way you'd want it.
	              (glancing to a Simone
	               billboard outside the
	               cemetery wall)
	          She killed you, Hank.  Now she's
	          killing me.  She's a serial killer.
	              (ducking out of sight of
	               the billboard as if
	               Simone is watching him)
	          But I don't know how to stop her. 
	          She's taken on a life of her own. 
	          I can't just come clean -- make
	          some confession.  I've defrauded
	          millions -- they'd turn on me.  And
	          I can't put the genie back in the
	          bottle.  If she stopped working --
	          dropped out of sight, they'd never
	          let it rest.  I've tried to kill
	          her career but they like her even
	          more.
	              (more desperate)
	          What am I going to do, Hank?
	
	A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind
	Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't say another word, Hank.  You
	          are truly a genius.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
	
	A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,
	SIMONE's face full screen.
	
	He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
	automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
	he puts his words in her mouth.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          What's the matter, Viktor?  You
	          look so sad.  Don't you love me
	          anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
	
	He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the only way, Simone.  If it's
	          any consolation, you're going to
	          live on in the public's heart like
	          all the other tragic figures that
	          went before their time.  There's no
	          love like posthumous love.
	
	On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know what you're thinking.  It's
	          a phoney-baloney world.  The women
	          are surgically enhanced, the
	          athletes are on steroids, the
	          singers are lip-syncing if they're
	          even singing at all, the news is
	          entertainment, the politicians are
	          bought and paid for -- we're living
	          one big lie.  So why shouldn't you
	          live too?  You're more authentic
	          than the people who adore you.
	              (a trace of despair)
	          And that's the problem.  You're
	          looking at the real fraud.  I told
	          myself this was all about the work
	          but if that was the truth, it
	          wouldn't matter to me -- and it
	          does.  It wasn't that the artists
	          had no respect for the art.  They
	          had no respect for me.  Someone
	          like you, you have so much love
	          showered on you -- I just wanted to
	          feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm
	          sorry, Simone.  Here I've been
	          trying to convince the world that
	          you exist, but I was really trying
	          to convince them that I exist. 
	          It's not that you aren't human,
	          Simone, it's that I am.
	
	Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
	8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.
	
	Viktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his
	own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
	
	Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
	"ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
	deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. 
	The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
	like dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
	digital breath.
	
	For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
	his own desk.
	
	Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. 
	His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
	marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
	hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts
	the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.
	
	EXT.  SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
	
	Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
	Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
	
	VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing.  A mournful pause
	-- then he heaves it over the side.  The trunk sinks like a
	stone.
	
	Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS.  A somber VIKTOR
	enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It is my sad and solemn duty to
	          announce the tragic passing of
	          Simone.
	
	A gasp from the audience.  Then, an explosion of anguish.
	
	                    CROWD
	          No!!  What happened?!  Oh.  God.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 1
	              (stepping forward,
	               mustering the courage to
	               ask the question)
	          How did she die?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A rare virus.
	              (pretending to compose
	               himself)
	          On her goodwill tour of the third
	          world.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 2
	          Did she suffer?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Mercifully, it was quick.
	
	At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON.  They are
	frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
	
	A)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
	
	B)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news
	    shows around the globe.
	
	C)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several
	    yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property
	    including the driveway.  VIKTOR insensitively drives over
	    the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX
	    SAYER and MILTON.
	
	D)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd
	    around a television showing a live picture of Simone's
	    funeral.
	
	E)  The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral
	    procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the
	    studio lot.  Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto
	    the hearse.
	
	F)  The same television picture is playing on a television
	    sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river.  LOCAL WOMEN
	    stop washing their clothes to watch.
	
	EXT.  GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
	
	We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an
	island in a lake.
	
	Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
	from the studio.  Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
	
	VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
	the coffin.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Elaine)
	          Can I see you later -- go away for
	          the weekend?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (horrified by the
	               suggestion)
	          How can you bring that up at a time
	          like this?
	
	The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum.  A
	PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor.  He nods
	and they start to carry the coffin towards the door. 
	However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
	
	A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid.  The
	coffin lid is pulled back.  Inside is a life-sized cardboard
	standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	The MOURNERS gasp.  Everyone looks to Viktor.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
	
	A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:
	
	JANE sits in the interview room, describing Viktor's assault
	on the standee.
	
	                    JANE
	          -- I heard him say, "Die bitch".
	
	A)  MAX SAYER, distraught and weeping.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- He was a controlling madman, she
	          was a prisoner.  I blame myself...
	          I should have done more to stop
	          it...
	
	B)  NICOLA gives a statement.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          -- It was strange.  He wanted to
	          replace her with me in his new
	          movie... and I know I'm not that
	          good.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE. 
	Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots,
	interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards
	from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls,
	stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and
	television appearances.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          -- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm
	          just trying to understand.  All
	          these films, TV appearances,
	          magazine covers, internet
	          interviews, publicity photos,
	          snapshots from her childhood -- all
	          fake.
	              (referring to various
	               items)
	          This is fake, this is fake -- fake,
	          fake, fake, all fake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's right.  You understand
	          perfectly.  I will confess to
	          fraud, not murder.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (referring to oversize
	               mail bags)
	          A fan club with a worldwide
	          membership in the millions -- also
	          bogus?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But
	          they were worshipping computer code
	          -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          So, of course, you couldn't kill
	          Simone because there never was a
	          Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you
	          talk so much about, a renowned
	          failure, who also happens to be so
	          conveniently dead -- perhaps the
	          "man" you claim helped invent
	          Simone is an invention himself?
	
	Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (patronizing smile)
	          But not everyone's imaginary, are
	          they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of
	          course, to Edith.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Who?
	
	The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door
	room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being
	interviewed.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          The woman you admitted to a
	          journalist is Simone's mother and
	          for whose silence you paid a
	          fortune?  Is she not flesh to you --
	          are her tears not wet?
	
	The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone
	through the window.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	          My BABY!
	
	The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.  Viktor rolls his
	eyes at the Detective's theatrics.  He is suddenly enraged.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's insane!  This whole thing is
	          insane!  There is no Simone.  Look!
	              (grabbing a Simone poster)
	          Even her name is fake.  It's not
	          Simone.
	              (he tears Simone's name in
	               half to demonstrate)
	          It's SIM... ONE!  Simulation One!
	
	The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
	
	                    DETECTIVE 2
	              (regarding Simone's face
	               also torn in half)
	          You really hated her, didn't you?
	
	The Detective places a tape, marked "EXHIBIT A" in a video
	machine.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Perhaps you could explain this to
	          me, Mr. Taransky -- or is this tape
	          "doctored" too?
	
	He plays a tape showing --
	
	EXT.  MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
	yacht.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          It's footage from the marina's
	          closed-circuit camera on the night
	          in question.  Altered, of course. 
	          Is that really what you expect us
	          to believe, Mr. Taransky?
	
	The Detective freezes the tape.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Can you tell us why you were
	          disposing of the body of a woman
	          who didn't exist?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It wasn't her body.  It was her
	          body of work.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Why don't you just come clean,
	          Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll
	          feel better afterwards.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I am telling the truth.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (coming close to him)
	          We all know what happened.  In a
	          fit of jealous rage you killed
	          Simone and dumped her body off a
	          boat she bought for you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll
	          take you to her.
	
	EXT.  BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
	and his LAWYER.  DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk. 
	Viktor's face lights up.
	
	The trunk is winched aboard.  However, as it lowers onto the
	deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar.  All
	eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted.  Apart from
	a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (panicky, desperately
	               grabbing the divers)
	          Did you find anything else --
	          drivers, discs... disc-drives?
	
	                    DIVER 1
	          Nothing.
	              (gazing to the water)
	          We couldn't stay down any longer.
	
	All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the
	water.
	
	CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:
	
	           "SIMONE"S BODY FEARED EATEN BY SHARKS"
	
	The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting
	opposite Viktor in his cell.  VIKTOR is numb -- the
	likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          -- Plead guilty and throw yourself
	          on the mercy of the court.  It's
	          the best deal you're going to get.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          I could get the death penalty.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          You certainly will if you go to
	          trial -- a jury in this kind of
	          ugly mood.  You've killed an icon,
	          for God's sake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,
	          there was no one to kill!
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (musing)
	          An insanity defence.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	A FIGURE sits at Viktor's computer.  LAINEY.  She scrolls
	through Viktor's files.  All empty.
	
	Lainey sighs.  ELAINE paces behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing
	          here.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Just a minute.
	
	Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, it's so like your father.  Why
	          can't people take responsibility
	          for their actions anymore?  I can
	          almost forgive him for killing
	          Simone -- but denying her
	          existence.  I can never forgive
	          that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Because obviously she existed,
	          right?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I know it as surely as you're
	          sitting here, sweetheart.  She was
	          the most vital woman I ever met.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          So you did meet her?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course.  What are you
	          suggesting?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I mean really meet her -- in the
	          flesh.
	
	Elaine regards her daughter curiously.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know it's embarrassing to admit
	          it, mom, but when I think about it 
	          -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it
	          feels like I have.  I know more
	          about her than members of my own
	          family.  She's even in my dreams. 
	          But I realized, going back through
	          my diary, they were all TV
	          appearances, near misses at
	          parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
	          on the internet.  I've never
	          actually seen Simone up close,
	          touched her, been in her physical
	          presence.  Have you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (unable to refute it)
	          Well, I --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- We don't believe daddy because
	          we don't want to believe we were
	          taken in too.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to shake the
	               notion from her head)
	          Lainey, there's no evidence that
	          Simone isn't real.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Listen to what you're saying, mom. 
	          Is there any evidence she is?
	
	Lainey finally tries another file.  She presses "EJECT".  The
	"PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the disc)
	          There's one part of dad's story
	          that may have been true.  Simone
	          may have contracted a virus.
	
	Lainey smiles at her mother.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Certain viruses can be cured.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - POLICE CELL - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething,
	while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy.
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (hushed tones, referring
	               to a thick Psychiatric
	               Report)
	          ... Listen, I've found a
	          psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
	          respected -- who's willing to
	          testify under oath that you have
	          diminished capacity due to the
	          trauma of your divorce, ten years
	          of abject failure in the movie
	          business and a bump on the head you
	          sustained as a child --
	
	VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- No!  I can't go along with this
	          horseshit!  Just tell them they can
	          fry me!
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (aghast, looking around to
	               see if anyone has heard)
	          What?!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It was premeditated -- I knew
	          exactly what I was doing!  I
	          strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! 
	          I set her on fire!  I did it!  I
	          killed her!
	
	                    DETECTIVE (O.S.)
	              (clearing his throat)
	          Excuse me.
	
	The Lawyer spins around guiltily.  The Detective stands
	outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession. 
	Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          I think you'd better see this.
	
	The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the
	cell.  VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" --
	
	INT.  TELEVISION STUDIO - "VBC" - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
	
	                    VBC ANCHOR
	              (from TV)
	          -- Breaking news -- international
	          media star, Simone, is alive and
	          well.  Her studio released this
	          footage only minutes ago...
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times --
	headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE"
	and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
	
	The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
	on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.  She
	winks to the camera.
	
	                    VBC ANCHOR
	          ... Simone reading today's edition
	          of the L.A. Times.  Who says, "The
	          only bad publicity is your
	          obituary"?  Details at the top of
	          the hour.
	
	The TV is switched off.  Viktor stares at the screen, trying
	to take it in.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're indestructible.
	
	When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding
	the cell door open.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (shaking his head in pity)
	          I'll never get you Hollywood
	          people.
	
	EXT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
	
	A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a
	sea for VIKTOR, released from custody.  One placard reads,
	"ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".  He is escorted to a waiting
	limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.  He hugs them
	both.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studying
	her laptop computer.  Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed
	against the glass.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (relaxing back into his
	               seat)
	          Thank you!
	              (to Lainey)
	          I don't know how you did it but
	          thank you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (putting her arm around
	               him)
	          Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. 
	          You know what we have to do?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (resigned smile)
	          Why stop at one character when you
	          can have a whole cast?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  Now that you have the
	          studio behind you, we can really do
	          things.
	
	Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (holding Viktor close)
	          I was thinking -- what about you
	          and... "Simone" moving back in with
	          me and Lainey?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          That sounds wonderful.
	              (to Lainey)
	          How do you feel about all this,
	          Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (beaming)
	          About you and mom?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Me and Simone.  What I did.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (sweet smile)
	          Your mistake wasn't making
	          something fake, daddy.  We're fine
	          with fake -- as long as you don't
	          lie about it.
	
	Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. 
	Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
	forces its way through the reporters.
	
	He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob.  Max has
	hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
	window --
	
	"WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE".  Viktor looks away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (kissing him on the cheek)
	          Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's
	          not a death sentence.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (still staring out of the
	               window, a rueful smile)
	          No... it's life.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY
	
	FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who
	appears as usual on a television monitor.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Simone, the question on
	          everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Frank, you know as well as I do,
	          living in a fish bowl, the
	          insatiable appetite of the media...
	
	Frank nods sympathetically.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          With everything that was going on
	          in my life, I just needed to drop
	          out of sight for a while -- I
	          needed time.  Viktor bought me that
	          time.  I owe him so much.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          We all do.
	              (quickly returning to
	               Simone)
	          But now I understand you're eager
	          to get back to work -- and not the
	          kind of work that we're all
	          expecting.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (smiles coyly)
	          That's true.  I can reveal that I
	          am considering a career in
	          politics.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          And what may I ask brought this on?
	
	SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I suppose this little man had
	          something to do with it.  Viktor
	          and I are both concerned about what
	          kind of world our new son, Chip, is
	          going to grow up in.
	              (turning lovingly to
	               Viktor)
	          Aren't you, Viktor?
	
	On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal
	VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning lovingly to

	ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
	
	The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
	of looking through a kaleidoscope.
	
	As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
	inside a CANDY BOWL.  A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
	removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	The man performing this curious task is
	writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
	conservatively dressed in suit and tie.  He sits alone at an
	empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
	some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
	the table's paper cloth.
	
	Viktor finishes sorting.  Finding no trash can to deposit the
	rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
	
	A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.  He looks
	ill.
	
	                    P.A.
	          Mr. Taransky --
	
	Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's walking?... Don't tell me
	          she's walking.
	              (blood slowly draining
	               from his face)
	          She is not walking... She can't
	          walk.
	
	EXT.  TRAILER - DAY
	
	NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
	face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
	from a movie trailer to a limousine.  VIKTOR desperately
	follows after Nicola.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Nicola!  How was your massage?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          You're in breach.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Is this about the new pages? --
	          I made the changes you wanted,
	          you're in virtually every scene --
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (wheeling on him)
	          It's not the size of the role,
	          Viktor.
	              (suddenly very cool)
	          Am I or am I not contractually
	          entitled to the biggest trailer on
	          the set?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding the enormous
	               silver fish behind them,
	               confused)
	          It's the biggest on earth!  I
	          swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream --
	          they don't make them any longer
	          than that.

	          Taller, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taller?  What?
	
	Viktor looks up in horror.  The trailer next to Nicola's does
	indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (walking away)
	          You've insulted me for the last
	          time.
	
	Viktor looks to the tires.  His face suddenly brightens.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Nicola, it's just the tires --
	          they're over-inflated!  I can fix
	          it!
	
	Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
	stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.  Air hisses out.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See, it's lower already.
	
	Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
	PUBLICIST.  Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I beg you.  You can't do this to
	          me.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (looking back)
	          I had three other offers.  I only
	          signed on to this picture out of...
	          loyalty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Then show some.  They'll shut me
	          down!
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (opening the car door)
	          It wasn't working anyhow.  The
	          scene with the thousand geese -- I
	          don't understand this film.  I
	          don't think anyone will understand
	          it.  I already put out a press
	          release -- citing "creative
	          differences".
	
	Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know what, Nicola, you're
	          right.
	              (picking up her last piece
	               of luggage)
	          Here, let me help you with that.
	              (holding the door for her)
	          You ought to go.  The truth is I
	          don't deserve you.  This film
	          doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it
	          deserves much, much better.  The
	          reason it's not working is because
	          you're not about the work.
	
	Nicola is stunned.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the limo driver)
	          To Hell, please.
	
	The door slams and the limo roars away.  Viktor looks to the
	still hissing trailer tire.  The CREW regards Viktor
	apprehensively.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the crew)
	          What are you looking at?  Get back
	          to work.
	
	The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
	veil of netting.  A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (whispered)
	          Jack... are you there?
	
	                    HAL
	          I'm here.  I'm right beside you.
	
	A NUN enters.
	
	                    NUN
	              (to Hal)
	          You should really go now.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          No, it's alright.  Please, let him
	          stay.
	
	The nun withdraws.  Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
	breaking down.
	
	                    HAL
	              (a glance to heaven)
	          What kind of cruel God is it that
	          would take you away from me?
	
	                    NICOLA
	          The same one who brought me to you.
	
	                    HAL
	          No... I cannot accept it.  If
	          something like this can happen. 
	          What...
	              (struggling to find the
	               words)
	          What is it for?
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (smiles through her pain)
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	Nicola dies peacefully.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
	head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film. 
	It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	The lights go up.  The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          She's good.  You can hardly tell
	          she's reading off a teleprompter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ignoring him)
	          I've analyzed the footage.  We've
	          got almost everything we need in
	          the can.  If we rework the script,
	          we can finish the film without her.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (forceful shake of the
	               head)
	          According to the writ her attorneys
	          filed at noon today.  They'll sue
	          if the film is released with Nicola
	          in a single frame.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (more anxious)
	          So we'll re-cast.
	
	                    HAL
	          Nicola Anders is the only actress
	          who can play that role.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not
	          bigger than this picture.
	
	Elaine finally speaks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course she is.  No other name is
	          going to sign on now and risk
	          offending her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We don't need a name.  We'll cast
	          an unknown.
	
	                    HAL
	          I won't play opposite an unknown.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's
	          soured on the project and we have
	          to accept that.  If we ever want to
	          be in the Nicola Anders business
	          again, we have to cut our losses
	          and shelve the picture.
	
	The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (aghast)
	          No!  You will not give in to that
	          blackmailing bitch!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (a wince, addressing
	               everyone but Viktor)
	          Excuse us.
	
	Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
	soundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's company.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, Viktor.  Why do you always
	          have to make things so difficult
	          for yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Difficult.  I'm difficult.
	
	He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the candy)
	          -- Do you know what these are,
	          Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (talking a piece of candy
	               and eating it)
	          Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
	          Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I,
	          Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
	          Award nominated director --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- overseeing the most cherished
	          movie project of my career, am
	          walking around with a pocketful of
	          cherry Mike & Ike's?
	
	Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I have a feeling you're going to
	          tell me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I'll tell you why.  It is
	          because Miss Nicola Anders,
	          supermodel with a SAG card God's
	          gift to cinema, has it written into
	          her contract that all cherry Mike &
	          Ike's be removed from her candy
	          dish along with strict instructions
	          that any room she walks into should
	          have seven packs of cigarettes
	          waiting for her three of them
	          opened, that there be a personal
	          jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
	          dressing room, and that any time
	          she travels, her nanny must fly
	          with her first class.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- What's wrong with that?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, she doesn't have any
	          children!
	              (grabbing her arm)
	          Don't you see?  We're being held
	          hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
	          someone somewhere has decreed are
	          the A-list.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          The public decides who's on that
	          list.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Please.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's the truth.  Those 17
	          superstars are our insurance
	          policy.  We can't open -- can't
	          make a profit without them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We can hardly make a profit with
	          them.  Up-front salary, back-end
	          deal, perks, per diem, percentages 
	          -- They're mocking us, Elaine. 
	          We're at their mercy.
	              (staring wistful, into
	               space)
	          We always had movie stars but they
	          used to be our stars.  We used to
	          decide who would play what role. 
	          We told them what to wear, what to
	          say, who to date.  When they were
	          under contract, we could change
	          their names if we wanted to -- more
	          than once!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (regarding him as if he's
	               insane)
	          You realize you're nostalgic for an
	          era you weren't even born in?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated at her
	               infuriating logic)
	          Well, I do remember why I started
	          out in this business -- you seem to
	          have forgotten -- working in New
	          York with Cassevetes -- we were
	          trying to do something important,
	          shine a light in that darkened
	          cinema --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)
	          -- It's called a projector.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ignoring her)
	          -- Illuminate hearts and minds with
	          a ray of truth.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor, I have good
	          memories of those days too -- but
	          this isn't about that or you or me
	          or some high-minded ideal.  This is
	          business.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Spare me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (gesturing at the studio
	               lot)
	          -- Christ, Viktor, look around. 
	          What do you think pays for all
	          this?  This is about investment and
	          return.  Those days in New York...
	          that's... it's over.
	
	A pause.  Viktor reads Elaine's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're not renewing my contract.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How can I?  Your last three
	          pictures tanked.  The board is
	          giving me hell.  No bankable star
	          will work with you after this.  If
	          you just compromised... a little.
	
	Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
	news.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (rueful smile)
	          -- Well, it's not every day you're
	          fired by the mother of your own
	          child.
	
	Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
	moment between them.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening, a heart-to
	               heart)
	          I'm not taking away your daughter,
	          just your deal.  You and I both
	          know, after the divorce I kept you
	          on for old time's sake, so you
	          could still hold your head up in
	          front of Lainey.  I called what's
	          his name at Warner's.  He said he'd
	          take a meeting -- in July.  I've
	          fought for you Viktor...
	              (voice trails off)
	          You want to talk severance?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (staring off into the
	               distance, face hardening)
	          You can have everything -- office,
	          car, assistants -- all I want is
	          the picture.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          The picture's dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          So there's no problem -- I can have
	          the rights, the negative too?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (believing she's getting
	               off lightly)
	          They're yours.  But how are you
	          going to finish it?  Without a star
	          there's no movie.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't need a star.  All I need is
	          an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
	          cut out Nicola and replace her with
	          a real actor.  A real leading lady.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Even if you find her, you know the
	          problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If
	          they're good, they get known.  And
	          then you're back to sorting their
	          candy... and worse.
	              (kissing him on the cheek
	               as she departs in her
	               studio golf cart)
	          I'm sorry, Viktor.
	
	Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
	alone on the deserted lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
	
	Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame.  VIKTOR's face
	appears amongst them.
	
	They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
	of an electric cart.  A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
	standees from around the lot.
	
	VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
	we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
	year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop
	computer.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly ashamed)
	          Hello, sweetheart.
	
	Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the
	suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
	
	Lainey smiles sweetly.  She hugs him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I'm sorry Mom canned you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (shrugging)
	          It's really... not anything,
	          Lainey.  It's just --

	          Don't feel too bad.
	              (glancing to a standee)
	          Mom runs the place and they still
	          walk all over her.  You're better
	          off out of it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding his daughter)
	          You look very grown up.  What are
	          you doing?  You meeting your mom
	          for dinner?
	
	She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
	ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
	boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Kent got tickets to the ballet.
	
	Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (trying to convince
	               himself as much as
	               Lainey)
	          I'm going to finish the picture,
	          sweetheart.  It's important.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're
	          Viktor Taransky.
	
	Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.  She runs to her
	mother and Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          That's right.  I'm Viktor Taransky.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK
	
	From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of
	VIKTOR.
	
	                    KENT
	          You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a
	          liability.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (wistful look to Viktor)
	          He also happens to be the most
	          talented man I've ever known.
	
	Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO BACKLOT - TRAM - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on a copy of "Variety".  The front page banner
	headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative
	Differences"
	
	The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on
	a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.  He wears a pair of spectacles
	with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side.  It
	is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one
	good eye.

	The tram pauses.  The TOUR GUIDE keeps up a commentary.

	          -- On your left, the house where
	          Claris Commodore uttered those now

	          doesn't hold, stand behind me". 
	          And coming up on your right --
	
	When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the
	tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway
	entrance.  The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay
	With The Tour".
	
	EXT.  STUDIO GATE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding
	several framed black and white photographs of screen legends
	under his arm.
	
	HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.
	He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated
	Bentley.
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky...
	          thank God.  I've been trying to see
	          you, calling -- Your assistant
	          wouldn't put me through.  I told
	          her it was a matter of life and
	          death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get
	          to you in time --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (using his stack of film
	               cans as a barrier)
	          -- Please, get away from me.
	
	                    HANK
	          I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked
	          skin.  I licked hair.  I licked
	          every part of her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (more disturbed, fearing
	               he is dealing with a
	               pervert)
	          You want me to call Security?
	
	                    HANK
	          I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The
	          answer to your prayers.
	              (producing the "Variety"
	               article, conspiratorial)
	          The answer to this.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regarding the article)
	          I was misquoted.
	
	                    HANK
	          I have your new leading lady...
	              (indicating the bulge in
	               his pocket)
	          ... right here in my pants.
	
	Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the
	man's motives.
	
	                    HANK
	              (trying to reassure)
	          It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you
	          recognize me? -- The Future of
	          Film conference in San Jose. 
	          Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote
	          speaker.  You must remember my
	          speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (faint glimmer of
	               recognition)
	          That's right.  You were booed off
	          the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Eight years ago.  In that whole
	          time, I never left my computer.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (wary)
	          Good for you, Hank.
	
	                    HANK
	              (referring to his covered
	               eye)

	              (regarding the pathetic
	               figure with the tilted

	                    HANK
	          Don't be.  It was worth it.
	
	Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket.  Viktor
	now understands the significance of the gesture.
	
	                    HANK
	          You have to see her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (loading cans into the
	               car)
	          I've seen them all before.
	
	                    HANK
	          Not like this --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (patronizing smile)
	          Come on, Hank.  A synthespian,
	          virtual actor -- ?
	
	                    HANK
	              (irritated)
	          -- We call them "vactors".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I need flesh and --
	
	                    HANK
	          -- Flesh is weak.

	Viktor loads his film cans into the car.

	              (pointing to Nicola in
	               Variety)
	          You already do.  But my actor won't

	                    VIKTOR
	          That's the point, Hank.  No matter
	          how good they are, they're still
	          Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. 
	          Everyone's failed.  It can't be
	          done.
	
	                    HANK
	          It can -- with my new computer
	          code, you and me, we can do it
	          together.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't know anything about
	          computers.
	
	                    HANK
	          That's why you're so perfect.  You
	          have something I don't have.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What's that?
	
	                    HANK
	          An eye -- for performance.  You
	          know the truth when you see it.  I
	          know.  I've seen your movies.  I
	          love your movies.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?
	
	                    HANK
	          "Straw God" changed my life.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You saw that?
	
	                    HANK
	          I've seen every frame of your work. 
	          You're the only filmmaker in
	          Hollywood with the artistic
	          integrity to realize my vision. 
	          You and me, art and science... we
	          are the perfect marriage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Listen, Hank, it's been a rough
	          day.
	              (climbing into his car)
	          I'll call you about his next week.
	
	                    HANK
	              (at the car window)
	          I won't be here next week.  The
	          tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winding down the window)
	          I'm already dead.
	
	Viktor's car roars away.  He looks back at the forlorn Hank
	in the rear view mirror.
	
	                    HANK
	          Call me.
	              (looking at his watch)
	          This week!
	
	A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
	wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
	
	A sea of ingenue headshots.  Black X's are drawn through all
	of them.  VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
	the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone, referring to
	               a young woman's headshot)
	          -- What do you mean she won't work
	          with me?  She's done nothing.  She
	          doesn't have a single credit --
	
	                    AGENT'S VOICE
	              (from phone, off-camera)
	          -- Better no credits than a
	          Taransky credit.  No young actress
	          is going to step into Nicola
	          Anders' shoes and risk ending her
	          career before it's even started.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Art, you don't understand.  I've
	          mortgaged everything to finish this
	          film -- creditors calling, coming
	          to the house, for God's sake, I
	          need this --
	
	The phone goes dead.  Viktor tries to re-dial --
	disconnected.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- Damn.
	
	Sharp knock on his door.  Viktor peers through a curtain and
	spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
	to be a legal notice in his hands.
	
	Viktor slips out of the back door.
	
	EXT.  BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR hurries along the beach.  When he turns, he discovers
	the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.  As Viktor runs, the Suit
	runs -- calling out to him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (calling back)
	          I'm not him.
	
	Viktor stumbles.  When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
	          estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
	              (showing him Hank's
	               obituary in the L.A. 
	               Times)
	          It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
	          you have this.
	
	The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it?
	
	                    MAN IN THE SUIT
	          I have no idea, Sir.  He wanted you
	          to have it.
	
	The Suit departs.  Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
	the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.  The hard-drive
	is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
	
	                      SIX MONTHS LATER
	
	CLOSE UP ON
	
	a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
	
	On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.  The red
	carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
	venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  To save money
	on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
	NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
	
	EXT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
	
	VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.  No paparazzi, no
	limos, no klieg lights.  Resorting to giving away tickets to
	PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
	trash.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Want to see a free movie?
	
	                    HOMELESS MAN
	              (he thinks)
	          No.
	
	A taxi pulls up.  Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (kissing him hello)
	          Hi, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Lainey.
	
	Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
	cash.  Lainey pays herself.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Your mother couldn't make it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's at the premiere of "A Cold
	          Day In Hell".  But I think she send
	          someone from Acquisitions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She still with Kent?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          This week anyhow.
	
	VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
	the pathetic premiere.  As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
	sole spotlight expires.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite how I imagined it --
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking on the bright
	               side)
	          -- You finished the film on your
	          own terms, that's what matters. 
	          Did you really do all the post
	          yourself?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There was no other way.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I missed you.  I wondered if you
	          were ever coming back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Me too.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the makeshift
	               poster, trying to lift
	               his spirits)
	          Well, I can't wait to meet
	          Simone... what's her last name?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know, I... don't know.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Is she here tonight?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She can't watch herself.
	
	They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
	
	                    THEATER OWNER
	          -- Hey, we have to start.  I've got
	          "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
	
	EXT.  PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
	
	A foggy, empty pier.  A MAN is running through the mist,
	shouting desperately.
	
	                    HAL
	          Valarie!  VALARIE!
	
	Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
	hood, her back to us.  The camera pushes in, music swells and
	she turns.  SIMONE.  She is exquisitely, ethereally
	beautiful.  Perfect.
	
	INT.  RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
	playing ON THE SCREEN.
	
	When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
	change.  They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
	OWNER.  Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
	faces, some opened-mouthed.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ON SCREEN, approaching)
	          Valarie, what are you running from?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (enigmatic smile)
	          From Valarie.
	
	Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.  Simone collapses to the
	ground.
	
	                    HAL
	              (running to her)
	          Valarie!  No!
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
	while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.  Viktor finally
	musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
	
	The same scene that played in the studio screening room. 
	However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
	leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          -- Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here.
	
	INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.  Now even LAINEY is affected by
	Simone's performance.  She wipes a tear from her eye.
	
	VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
	audience reaction.  Finally the credits roll.
	
	A dedication, "For HANK".
	
	No one moves from their seats.  Viktor permits himself a
	brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
	credits:
	
	                 A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
	
	Still no one moves from their seats.  Viktor cannot stand it
	any longer.  He runs to the restroom.
	
	INT.  THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
	
	Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
	water.  He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
	reflection.  He rehearses a courtroom speech.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
	          may be guilty of a crime, but it
	          was committed with the purest of
	          intentions, to send a message to
	          the acting community who put
	          themselves above the work and
	          above --
	
	Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom.  They approach the
	urinals.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	              (continuing their
	               conversation from the
	               lobby)
	          -- So fake.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
	          -- Totally artificial.
	
	Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
	the end of their conversation.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
	          We're really supposed to believe
	          that was 19th Century Lisbon?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
	          Who's looking at the sets when she
	          is on the screen?
	
	All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
	
	INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR exits the restroom.  Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
	including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (pointing out her father)
	          There he is.  That's my dad, Viktor
	          Taransky.
	
	Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
	spontaneously applauds.  They rush to shake his hand.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
	          -- She is magnificent.
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
	          -- Absolutely unreal.
	
	Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She wasn't too... cartoony?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
	          -- Who?  The nun?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 7
	          -- Or are you talking about the
	          mother?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
	          -- A star like that, who cares
	          about the supporting cast?
	
	                    AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
	          -- Congratulations again.  She
	          was... not of this earth.  You
	          should be very proud.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Not of this earth".  A good way of
	          putting it.  And the film as a
	          whole -- ?
	
	The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did
	          you find her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (vague)
	          I saw her picture on the, er...
	          internet.
	              (interrogating his
	               daughter's face)
	          You really didn't notice anything --
	          unusual?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Only her brilliance.  To be honest,
	          with what you had to work with, I
	          was expecting a train wreck.  You
	          really pulled it off.
	
	Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I have a feeling mom is going to
	          take you back after this.
	
	Viktor's head snaps around.  Lainey smiles.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Back on the lot.
	
	Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail. 
	His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message
	light reads "FULL".  He hits the "PLAY" button.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          Viktor, you bastard!  I hear it's
	          great.
	              (beat)
	          Seriously, I'm happy for you.
	
	Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine
	from happier times.  He gazes at it as he listens to the
	message.
	
	                    ELAINE (V.O.)
	          I know people are going to be
	          beating down your door but... well,
	          I'd love the chance to buy back
	          something I gave away for free. 
	          Don't you just love Hollywood?...
	          BEEP.
	
	Viktor stops the machine, dazed.  He idly opens his mail. 
	Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's
	name, "SIMONE".
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
	
	A)  A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown
	    movie theater as far as the eye can see.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          A dazzling new ingenue has come
	          from seemingly nowhere to capture
	          the hearts of movie-going audiences
	          across the nation...
	
	B)  THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads,
	    "SIMONE: A REVELATION -- Dawning Of A New Star In
	    "SUNRISE".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          ... in her debut film, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset".
	
	C)  A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first
	    website dedicated to SIMONE.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her face is already posted on
	          everything from websites to bedroom
	          walls.
	
	D)  Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in
	    Simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          Her wardrobe has inspired a fashion
	          craze.
	
	E)  In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an
	    UNDERCOVER REPORTER a pirated recording of SIMONE on a
	    camcorder.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
	          And bootleg copies of her film are
	          being sold in back alleys all over
	          the world.
	
	F)  A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter
	    showing a clip of SIMONE from, "SUNRISE, SUNSET Courtesy:
	    Taransky Productions".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from TV)
	          But who is Simone?  We know so
	          little about her.  No details of
	          her background have been released,
	          not even her age.  She is somewhere
	          between a girl and a woman.  A
	          fresh face and familiar both at the
	          same time.
	
	G)  The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a
	    multiplex.  The marquee has 16 screens and looks like
	    this:
	
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	        "SUNRISE, SUNSET"         "THE MAKING OF
	                                       SUNRISE, SUNSET"
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	          Is Simone even her real name?  And
	          why the secrecy?  All we know for
	          sure is that she was discovered by
	          little-known director, Viktor
	          Tarinsky.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,
	corrects the reporter.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (from the TV)
	          He has parlayed his relationship
	          with the new sensation into a three
	          picture deal with the very studio
	          that dumped him only six months
	          ago.  And no wonder with the
	          starlet's performance breaking all
	          box office records.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO GATE - MORNING
	
	Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
	PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
	glimpse of SIMONE.
	
	                    MOB
	          Simone!  SIMONE!  I LOVE YOU!  I
	          Want to BE you!
	
	Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
	lot.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
	limousine on the studio steps.
	 
	A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.  A banner
	reads, "Welcome SIMONE".  A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
	
	VIKTOR steps out of the car.  ELAINE pushes past him, into
	the limo.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone!... Simone?
	
	The car is empty.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (re-emerging from the car)
	          Where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good to see you too, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring his sarcasm)
	          Why isn't she with you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Why?  Because she would never show
	          up at something like this.  She's
	          intensely private.
	
	Elaine sighs, exasperated.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (dismissing her
	               colleagues)
	          Back to work, everyone.  She's not
	          here.
	
	The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor... I want to thank you for
	          convincing Simone to sign with the
	          studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't thank me.  It was entirely
	          Simone's decision.  Do you have
	          Simone's check?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it
	          means a lot.
	              (quickly changing tack)
	          Have you read the reviews?  They're
	          love letters.
	              (reading from a newspaper)
	          Listen to this one.  "Simone has
	          the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
	          the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
	          of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
	          face of Audrey Hepburn combined
	          with an angel".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (musing to himself)
	          Almost right.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't wait to meet her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I don't know if that's going to
	          happen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Why not?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I say, she's... something of a
	          recluse.  That's how she's able to
	          stay so pure -- by isolating
	          herself in her art.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (face falling)
	          Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a
	          press conference.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Out of the question.  A circus like
	          that?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, it's my studio.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's my actor.  There are other
	          studios, Elaine.  There's only one
	          Simone.
	              (leaving her on the steps)
	          Leave the press conference to me.
	
	Viktor strides up the studio steps.  Elaine stares after her
	ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
	arrogance.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
	
	The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
	podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent
	fame by association.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (tapping the microphone)
	          Is this on?
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          Who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Taransky, Viktor.  T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
	          V-i-k-t-o-r.
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          Yeah, but -- who are you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (patronizing smile)
	          I am a two-time Academy Award
	          nominated director with over
	          eighteen films to my credit thus
	          far including my latest release,
	          "Sunrise, Sunset".  Who are you?
	
	A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I will not be taking any questions. 
	          However I do have a statement to
	          read on behalf of my leading lady,
	          Simone.
	              (reading from his
	               statement)
	          "To Whom It May Concern.  I'm
	          deeply grateful for the
	          extraordinary public response to
	          Mr. Taransky's film.  At this time
	          I will be conducting no interviews
	          or making publicity appearances
	          since I am really nothing without
	          the beautiful worlds and characters
	          Mr. Taransky creates for me.  I
	          politely request that the press
	          respect my privacy and let the work
	          speak for itself.  All questions
	          and inquiries should be directed to
	          Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
	          aspects of my career.  Yours very
	          truly, Simone".
	
	The reporters all call out at once.
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
	          dating?
	
	                    REPORTER 3
	          -- Viktor, where'd you find her?
	
	                    REPORTER 4
	          -- Is Simone her real name?
	
	                    REPORTER 5
	          -- What's she got to hide?
	
	                    REPORTER 1
	          -- Is she the new Garbo?
	
	                    REPORTER 2
	          -- Who's Garbo?
	
	Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
	hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I thought I made it clear -- no
	          questions regarding Simone.
	              (bringing the press
	               conference to a hasty
	               conclusion)
	          Now, I would like to close by
	          announcing that Miss Simone begins
	          production today on her next film,
	          "Eternity Forever".  This project
	          has been near and dear to my heart
	          since I wrote it nine years ago.
	              (a tinge of bitterness,
	               then a smile)
	          I Thank you.
	
	Viktor exits the podium.  A voice stops him in his tracks.
	
	                    VOICE (O.S.)
	          Who do you think you're fooling,
	          Taransky?
	
	Viktor turns.  The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
	truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
	by his assistant, MILTON.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do I know you?
	
	                    MAX
	          Max Sayer -- National Echo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (regaining his composure,
	               a smirk)
	          Don't you have a real story to
	          write?  Why aren't you in Latin
	          America?
	
	                    MAX
	          This is the story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I remember when the Echo had class 
	          -- the paper that could bring down
	          governments.
	
	                    MAX
	          Our leaders aren't presidents
	          anymore -- they're pop stars and
	          screen idols.  If Woodward and
	          Bernstein were alive today, they'd
	          be right here in Hollywood with me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          They are alive, Sayer.
	
	Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
	
	                    MAX
	          So they're probably here.
	              (hardly missing a beat)
	          You might be able to sell this
	          'disappearing act' to the rest of
	          the world, but I'm not buying it. 
	          What's really behind this Simone
	          woman?  The public has a right to
	          know.  Why is she staying out of
	          sight?  And why the hell is she
	          with you?  I don't want you to take
	          this the wrong way, Viktor, but
	          you're not exactly Cecil B. 
	          DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Maybe the reason she's with me is a
	          little thing called integrity,
	          Sayer.  Look it up.
	
	Viktor walks away.
	
	                    MAX
	              (calling after him)
	          Oh, I know all about integrity.  I
	          know even more about persistence. 
	          Look that one up.
	
	Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
	
	EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
	
	"CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
	panning the entrance.  A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
	nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
	cart, script in hand.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          No one came in or went out just
	          like you said, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Good.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          Is Miss Simone coming today?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's already here.  She arrived
	          before you and she'll leave long
	          after you've gone.
	              (admonishing guard)
	          Remember, under no circumstances
	          are you or any other person to
	          enter the set without my express
	          permission.
	
	                    SECURITY GUARD
	          What if it catches on fire?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let it burn.  Simone would rather
	          go up in flames than give up her
	          privacy.
	
	Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
	the soundstage.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
	a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
	tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
	side monitors.  VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself as he inserts
	               his Hollywood hard-drive 
	               -- SIMULATION ONE)
	          Pay no attention to the man behind
	          the computer.
	
	A title appears on his computer screen.
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                       SIMULATION ONE
	
	With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
	revises the title to:
	
	                          Welcome
	                             to
	                           SIMONE
	
	He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
	wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
	emerges -- SIMONE.  She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
	blood actress.
	
	Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
	titled "VISUAL LOOP 6".  Within the confines of the monitor
	she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.  She looks a
	little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
	too long.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the screen)
	          Good morning, Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A star is...
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          ... digitized.
	
	Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
	into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
	key on his keyboard.  When he speaks, she speaks.  Simone's
	voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
	Viktor's voice.  A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
	mimic his movements.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You mean they buy it?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nervous smile as he
	               examines his first
	               royalty check)
	          Buy it?  They're paying for it. 
	          And around here that's how you
	          really know they buy it.
	
	Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
	the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
	          see this.
	
	Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (depressing the button
	               every time he wants to
	               express his thoughts
	               through Simone)
	          Maybe he can.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do you have any idea what this
	          means, Simone?  Our ability to
	          manufacture fraud now exceeds our
	          ability to detect it.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (appearing to indulge
	               Viktor with a smile)
	          I am the death of real.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pondering the enormity of
	               the hoax)
	          You are birth of... what?  A
	          Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era
	          in show business.  All I wanted to
	          do was finish the film.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started. 
	          And now look what you've started.
	
	Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
	amusement.  He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hmm... a little less Streep, a
	          little more Bacall.
	
	Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
	dead, that comprise Simone.
	
	Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
	dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
	deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
	
	He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment.  The
	voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
	representations of the sound waves.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it is.
	
	VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself.  He scrolls through the
	list of screen legends.  He clicks on the image of AUDREY
	HEPBURN.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          While I think of it, I'd like you
	          to add something to your repertoire
	          -- remember that thing Hepburn does
	          in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
	
	A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
	the screen.  Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
	
	                    AUDREY HEPBURN
	              (from the screen, an
	               incomparable smile)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pausing the moment)
	          Let's hear you say "Hi" like
	          Audrey.
	
	With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
	into a frozen Simone.  Viktor presses play.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (imitating Audrey's
	               performance perfectly)
	          Hi.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect.
	              (stretching)
	          God, I'm so relaxed around you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You did create me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.  I... just helped bring someone
	          else's dream to life.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
	          nothing without you.  I was
	          computer code -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're right.  You're right.  Of
	          course, one doesn't want to boast. 
	          It's a classic case of technology
	          in search of an artist.  That's all
	          you've been waiting for, an artist
	          with integrity, with a vision, who
	          can see.
	
	Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
	his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
	nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          See beyond that irrational
	          allegiance to flesh and blood. --
	          See that with the rise in price of
	          a real actor and the fall in price
	          of a fake, the scales have tipped
	          in favor of the fake.
	              (voice raising in
	               excitement)
	          -- See that if the performance is
	          genuine, it doesn't matter if the
	          actor is real.  Once a performance
	          is committed to film, the blood and
	          bones are gone anyway.  Only the
	          spirit, the illusion remains. 
	          Besides, what's real anymore? 
	          These days most actors have digital
	          work done to them so it's a gray
	          area.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (Simone appears to look
	               directly at her maker)
	          Are you ever going to tell the
	          truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The only real truth is in the work.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You know what I'm talking about.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the
	          truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
	              (pondering his own
	               question)
	          Of course, with Hank's tragic
	          passing, the secret died with him.
	              (shaking the thought from
	               his head)
	          I am going to tell the truth...
	          after your next picture.
	
	Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject. 
	He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Speaking of which -- this is the
	          project I'd like you to do next.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The
	          legendary unproduced script that
	          was too good ever to get made?  I'd
	          kill for that part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I was hoping you'd say that.
	
	Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pretending to be hard of
	               hearing)
	          I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. 
	          What did you say?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
	          Taransky.
	
	On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
	RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button.  He is
	unable to resist speaking another line.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          And I will never, ever leave you.
	
	Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
	until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
	"GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
	FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
	
	Viktor comes close to the monitor.  He notices something
	about Simone's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so beautiful.  Too
	          beautiful.
	
	Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
	He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
	
	From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
	empty soundstage.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	VIKTOR's face against the SKY.  As he walks, we reveal that
	the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
	studio lot -- behind a parking lot.  Viktor hands his valet
	ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
	
	                    VALET MANAGER
	          -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky. 
	          We gave you a complimentary car
	          wash -- they're washing the engine
	          now.
	
	Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
	their cars under an umbrella.  A young TALENT AGENT
	approaches.
	
	                    TALENT AGENT
	          Viktor!  Look, I'm sorry I didn't
	          call you back last year.  I was,
	          er... out of the country.
	              (strained moment)
	          But we should get together.  My
	          schedule's wide open.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Sure, I'll... "call you".
	
	The agent's face falls.  He gets in his car, disconsolate.
	
	Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
	
	                    HAL
	          Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hello, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          The film.  The chemistry.  No
	          reflections on Nicola but Simone
	          and I -- we were just so right
	          together.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You never were together, Hal.
	
	                    HAL
	          And still the connection was
	          undeniable.
	              (aside)
	          I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
	          but I know it's brilliant.  And I
	          know I would be perfect for Clive.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (correcting him)
	          Clyde.
	
	                    HAL
	          Yes, perfect.
	              (lowering his voice)
	          As a matter of fact, I ran into
	          Simone on the lot the other day.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (genuinely startled)
	          Really?  She didn't mention it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (quickly covering)
	          I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
	          of people right now.
	              (under his breath)
	          She is just as you described her,
	          Viktor... indescribable.  I
	          strongly sensed she thought I was
	          right for it.
	
	Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
	his cell phone.  The phone rings.  Viktor feigns surprise and
	answers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (answering the phone he
	               has just dialed, louder
	               than necessary)
	          Hello?... SIMONE!  How are you,
	          sweetheart?
	
	A hush descends over the executives.  Hal is suddenly very
	uncomfortable.  Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
	conversation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (winking to Hal)
	          You'll never guess who I'm with...
	          you ran into him on the lot.
	
	                    HAL
	          It was more in passing.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're so far off!
	              (finally chuckles)
	          Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
	          star.  Remember now?... No, I don't
	          think he's put on weight.
	              (a shrug of apology to the
	               appalled Hal)
	          Anyway, you think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction...
	              (covering phone, to Hal)
	          I'll try to talk her into it.
	
	The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark.  A
	mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
	into his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          ... Listen this is a bad place to
	          talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
	          you have charity work you want to
	          do, I know you want to give back --
	          but remember, your greatest gift is
	          your talent... we'll talk about it
	          at the beach house this weekend...
	          I'm looking forward to it too.
	
	Viktor hangs up.  His car pulls up.  He tips extravagantly
	and drives away.  The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
	phones.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
	
	Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
	windows.
	
	INT.  CAR - DAY
	
	Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in
	hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a
	computer.
	
	                    VIKTOR'S VOICE
	              (from the machine)
	          -- "... You think he's right for
	          "Eternity Forever"?... not the
	          right type?... a different
	          direction..."
	
	                    MILTON
	              (to Max, a shake of the
	               head)
	          I'm getting nothing from her side
	          of the conversation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Is it a jamming device?
	
	                    MILTON
	              (shrugs)
	          Maybe he's talking to himself.
	
	                    MAX
	              (dismissing the idea)
	          Taransky isn't that good an actor. 
	          No, they're taking special
	          precautions.  Some kind of new
	          encryption.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Why?
	
	                    MAX
	              (musing)
	          Whatever it is, it's dark.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Dark?
	
	                    MAX
	          Yes, very.
	
	They continue listening to the recording.

	          "... We'll talk about it at the

	MAX's eyes light up.  He gazes to a photo of SIMONE pasted to
	the inside of the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING
	
	VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.  Lainey is in her pajamas,
	occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father
	prepares French toast.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to the computer)
	          Can't you stop that?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Those things can be dangerous. 
	          Staring at a screen all day -- you
	          miss what's going on outside in the
	          real world.  You can lose yourself. 
	          You should get out more.  How are
	          you going to meet boys?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs coyly, getting up)
	          I know plenty of boys.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Really?  Who?  Where do you meet
	          them?  In a chat room?  How do you
	          know he's not some middle-aged
	          freak?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak
	          a mile away.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Okay.  But you have to find a way
	          to escape that thing.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          How?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I read.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You do?  Still?  I can't tell you
	          how happy I am to hear that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          You were the one who insisted on
	          it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and
	          Joyce when I was four.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understood them.  That's what
	          was amazing.
	              (looking out the window)
	          It's a nice day.  Let's eat
	          outside.
	
	Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door.  We hear a
	chorus of CLICKS.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Actually, it may be nicer inside.
	
	Viktor joins her at the doorway.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Stay here, I'll deal with this.
	
	Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
	
	Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
	of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS.  The next door houses
	have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
	
	VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
	the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
	waving extravagantly.
	
	Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
	nearby rooftop.  The photographer limps towards the fence. 
	Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
	and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
	relishing the attention.
	
	The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
	several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          That wasn't her, Taransky.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Where is she?  You can't hide her
	          forever.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (hurling the camera into
	               the mob)
	          You'll never find her.  Simone only
	          appears when I want her to appear.
	
	MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
	accompanied by assistant MILTON.
	
	                    MAX
	          She sounds like a prisoner,
	          Taransky.  Are you holding her
	          hostage?  Are you some kind of
	          Svengali?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (recognizing the reporter)
	          Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
	          you?  You look kind of "captive"
	          yourself.  While you're spending
	          every waking hour obsessing over
	          Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
	          doesn't even know you exist.  Get
	          off my property or I'll call the
	          cops.
	
	                    MAX
	          The cops?  The cops read my column
	          to know who to bust.  We're the
	          only watchdog the public has.
	              (looking around at the
	               photographers)
	          None of this is going away.  We'll
	          be here tomorrow and the day after
	          that.  Until you slip up.  And you
	          will.  You are looking at your
	          shadow.
	              (getting in his face)
	          Because all these elaborate
	          precautions with Simone -- every
	          instinct in my body tells me, it's
	          not natural.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. 
	          I don't want you to be
	          disappointed.  It gets cold out
	          here at night.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice try.  If we can't get to her
	          through you, maybe your family will
	          be more co-operative.  I can
	          guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
	          another, Miss Simone and I are
	          going to get acquainted.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning away)
	          I'd like to see that, Sayer. 
	          Invite me.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the
	passenger seat.  They have become so blase about the
	paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle
	PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
	
	                    REPORTER (ON RADIO)
	          -- The rumor is, Simone is holed up
	          in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far
	          we haven't seen so much as a
	          glimpse --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (switching off the radio)
	          Honey, I'm really sorry about all
	          this.  I don't know if it's safe
	          for you to stay the weekends...
	          just until things settle down.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (shrugs)
	          Okay, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          If anyone asks about Simone --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I know, I don't know anything.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Exactly.
	              (slightly irritated by her
	               lack of interest)
	          Don't you wonder where I'm really
	          hiding Simone?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (looking to him)
	          I'm sure you'd tell me if you
	          thought it was important.
	
	Lainey gives her father a smile.  Through the car window
	behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops
	down a bank.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion.  LAINEY
	gives her father a kiss and departs.  ELAINE, in the garden,
	overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (from the car)
	          Sorry I didn't get her back in
	          time.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No problem.
	              (she smiles)
	          Do you want to come in?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (surprised -- pleasantly)
	          Why not?
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where KENT
	is working on a computer.  Kent smiles blandly.
	
	                    KENT
	          Hey, Vik.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (disappointed to see him)
	          Hello -- Kent.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room.  Despite the eighty
	degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth. 
	ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file.  Viktor's face
	falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, we simply have to talk
	          about "Eternity..."
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          "Forever".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whatever.  I still haven't received
	          Simone's script notes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          There aren't any.  If the
	          filmmakers are happy, Simone's
	          happy.  She considers herself an...
	          "instrument".
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Really?  Oh, so she's really going
	          to do all this nudity?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (shrugs)
	          If it's on the page...
	
	Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, something has to be done
	          about this budget.  It's completely
	          unrealistic.
	              (referring to a column in
	               the budget)
	          You allowed nothing for limousine
	          service.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll drive herself.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Hair and make-up?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll do her own.  Theater
	          training.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was in the theater?  When? 
	          Where?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll send you her resume.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Al least a contingency for
	          wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a
	          dress size.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I guarantee she won't gain an
	          once.  She's very disciplined.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned by an entry in
	               the budget)
	          Well, we have to do something about
	          this -- "stuntwoman".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What about it?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          There isn't one.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No need.  She does all her own
	          stunts.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (skeptical)
	          Even the fall from the plane?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (nonchalant)
	          Even the fall from the plane.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Well, shoot it on the last day.
	
	Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          As I've tried to explain to you,
	          Elaine.  Simone isn't like any
	          other actress you've ever known. 
	          She's about the work and only the
	          work -- lives for the work.  She
	          wants all the money up there...
	              (gazing into space)
	          ... on the screen where it belongs. 
	          She'd work for scale except I know
	          you only respect people you pay a
	          fortune.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Which accounts for your percentage.
	              (tossing the budget on the
	               coffee table)
	          When do I get to meet this dream?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not today.  She's learning her
	          lines.
	              (glancing to Elaine's

	          You can also take cue cards and
	          teleprompter out of the budget.

	          I'll walk you out.
	
	Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.
	
	EXT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
	
	ELAINE's demeanor softens.  She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
	sympathetically.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
	          you now, not as Elaine, studio
	          head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
	              (correcting herself)
	          Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this
	          last time but you need to be
	          careful.  We both know you wouldn't
	          be making this overblown art film
	          of you hadn't convinced Simone to
	          be in it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, talking to you now, not as
	          Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
	          husband... what the hell happened
	          to you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (exasperated)
	          Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this
	          a hundred times -- young stars
	          destroying the very people who
	          discovered them.  I'm worried about
	          you, that's all.  This woman -- she
	          controls your destiny.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone does not control my destiny.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of
	          my feelings.  There's something
	          about her I don't trust.
	
	From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY
	smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR enters his office where he's greeted by his assistant,
	JANE.
	
	                    JANE
	              (sheepish)
	          Thanks for taking me back, Mr.
	          Taransky.  I know it looked like I
	          sided with the studio, but I always
	          believed in you, honestly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't worry.  I understand.
	
	                    JANE
	              (referring to the cast
	               seated around a
	               conference table)
	          They're all here.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits at the head of the table, surrounded by HAL,
	LOTUS, MAC and three other CAST MEMBERS.  A preliminary
	poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY
	FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I can't tell you how delighted I am
	          to have this wonderful cast
	          assembled for "Eternity Forever". 
	          Thank you all.  Now, a reminder --
	          as a condition for working on this
	          film, you will not be rehearsing
	          with Simone, shooting with Simone
	          and you are forbidden from
	          contacting Simone in any way at any
	          time, whatsoever.
	
	The CAST nods seriously.
	
	                    HAL
	              (a thought occurs)
	          How will you do our love scenes?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Body double.
	
	                    HAL
	              (confused)
	          For her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          For you.
	              (addressing the entire
	               cast)
	          I want you to know, Simone
	          appreciates you all working for
	          scale.  But why am I thanking you? 
	          Simone can thank you herself.  She
	          insisted on speaking with you
	          before filming begins.  She's on
	          the line now.
	
	Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a
	red blinking light on the phone.  The cast reacts excitedly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pushing a button on the
	               phone)
	          Simone, are you there?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (through the speakerphone)
	          I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    LOTUS
	              (unable to contain her
	               excitement)
	          So are we, Simone!
	
	Everyone laughs giddily.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Why don't you leave me alone with
	          my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we
	          can get to know each other better?
	
	                    HAL
	          Good idea.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course.  I'll be back in a
	          minute.
	
	Viktor exits.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Hi.  Who's there?  Don't be shy. 
	          Introduce yourselves.
	
	The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone.  Mac breaks
	the silence.
	
	                    MAC
	          I'm Mac.  I turned down a
	          Bertolucci film to be here.
	
	                    LOTUS
	          My name's Lotus.  God, I can't
	          believe I'm talking to you.  We're
	          going to become such great friends.
	
	                    HAL
	          I'm Hal.  Wonderful to be working
	          together... again.
	
	The other cast members introduce themselves.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the
	nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital
	player, connected to a phone.  Simone's pre-recorded opening
	remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost
	completed.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Is that everyone...?
	              (pause)
	          Well, obviously, as you know...
	
	Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time,
	speaking through the synthesizer.  As usual, Viktor's voice
	is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          ... I'm Simone.   
	
	The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.
	
	                    HAL
	              (from Viktor's
	               speakerphone)
	          Obviously.  Who else?
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (from speaker phone)
	          I just want to start by apologizing
	          for my "process" --
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	The CAST are hunched over the speakerphone.
	
	                    MAC
	          -- No.  No.  I'm completely
	          simpatico.  On my last film I was
	          playing a schizophrenic so I made
	          them give me two dressing rooms.
	
	                    HAL
	              (an aside)
	          So committed.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          Well thank you for your
	          understanding.  I know it's an
	          unusual way to work but I just find
	          I relate better to people when
	          they're not actually there.
	
	                    LOTUS
	          Of course, of course.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          I don't have much to say except
	          that I know it's going to be a
	          great project, if we all just trust
	          Mr. Taransky's vision.  Always do
	          what Mr. Taransky says.  If in
	          doubt, do it the Taransky way.
	
	They all nod vigorously in agreement.
	
	                    SIMONE (O.S.)
	          I know we're going to make a
	          wonderful movie together.
	
	                    LOTUS
	              (nodding in agreement)
	          Wonderful movie.
	
	                    HAL
	          Together, absolutely.
	
	EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
	
	VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage.  A young
	cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart,
	tentatively approaches.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          Mr. Taransky...
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the stage)
	          No one goes in there.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          Oh, I know.
	
	Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIVIAN
	          If it's not too much trouble. 
	          Could you...?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course...
	
	                    VIVIAN
	              (hesitant about broaching
	               the subject)
	          This last year I was... going
	          through some things.
	              (shaking her head at the
	               memory)
	          Awful, awful... things.  But when I
	          saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
	          did... in the scene in the
	          fireworks factory...
	              (face lighting up)
	          ... suddenly everything made sense. 
	          My friends, family, doctors --
	          nobody could reach me -- but
	          Simone, she really... spoke to me.
	
	Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She'll be happy to sign it.
	
	INT.  PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	A green set.  Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green.  A FULL
	CAST shoots HAL, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively
	crossing the green expanse.
	
	Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward. 
	Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the
	ground.
	
	                    VIKTOR (O.S.)
	          Cut!  Cut!... Cut!
	
	Hal freezes.  VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and
	confronts Hal on the green floor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hal, what are you doing?
	
	                    HAL
	          Viktor, Clyde simply has to get
	          close to Simone in this scene!  He
	          has to touch her.  He has to!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Absolutely not!
	
	                    HAL
	          But she's right there!  I must feel
	          her!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You can't.
	
	                    HAL
	          Why not?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (struggling to find an
	               excuse)
	          There's... a wall between you --
	
	                    HAL
	          -- an emotional wall, I know. 
	          That's why --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- No.  No.  A real wall.
	              (describing a wall with
	               his hands within the
	               green space)
	          You ran right through it.
	
	                    HAL
	              (confused)
	          How did the wall get there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I can't explain it to you now --
	          you'll see when it's all put
	          together.
	              (walking away)
	          Anyway, we got it a couple of takes
	          ago.  Let's move on.
	
	Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with
	HAL in a scene from "Eternity Forever".  He works on her
	close up.

	          Let's take it down a notch.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          -- What you don't understand --
	
	Simone freezes again.  Viktor make another adjustment.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I like it.  But still too big.
	              (making a correction)
	          Smaller teardrops next time.
	
	Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's not working.  It's not alive. 
	          Let's try it again.
	
	She repeats the line.  Viktor mimes the performance.

	              (teardrops arriving on
	               cue)
	          -- What you don't understand,
	          Clyde, is that love is like a wild

	          on the edge...
	              (dramatic pause)
	          ... of a very high cliff.
	
	Simone FREEZES.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Perfect, Simone.
	
	Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm only sorry you still have to
	          work with flesh and blood for the
	          time being -- as user friendly as
	          you are, even I can't manufacture
	          an entire cast.
	
	"To Vivian.  Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity
	shot.  He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
	
	Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
	she is waiting patiently, as usual.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          We are going to have to change our
	          plans, Simone -- you have no idea
	          what an affect your performance is
	          having on people.  We can't stop
	          now.  There's too much to say --
	          these films they speak, they speak
	          to the human condition.  We're
	          changing lives.  No, revealing the
	          truth now would be too cruel.
	              (searching for more
	               justification)
	          Anyway, when you're seeking a
	          greater truth -- in the work -- you
	          are not so concerned with the
	          lesser truths along the way.
	
	Simone doesn't appear convinced.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          You're going to get in a lot of
	          trouble, Mr. Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated at her pricking
	               his conscience)
	          Why do you have to bring that up? 
	          There's always risk -- life's a
	          risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how
	          could something so lovely be a
	          crime?
	              (regarding her tenderly)
	          Well, I think we've done enough for
	          today.  You've been cooped up in
	          there too long.  How about you and
	          me go out on the town?  They're
	          expecting us.
	
	He turns to a copy of "The Echo".  A photo of Viktor at the
	gate of his Malibu home.  "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self
	proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".  Viktor
	puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an
	opulent hotel.  He approached the CONCIERGE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm checking in a special guest...
	              (obviously conspiratorial)
	          ... Miss Enomis.
	
	The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy
	of "Variety".  Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails
	To Three Picture Deal".
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	          Miss Enomis, yes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Miss Enomis demands her privacy. 
	          You will switch off all
	          surveillance cameras.  I will
	          escort Miss Enomis to her room
	          alone via the rear exit.  She will
	          require no help with her luggage. 
	          She does not wish to be disturbed
	          at any time for any reason.  She
	          will be departing for a function
	          tonight at eight sharp.
	              (tipping him with a
	               hundred dollar bill)
	          I'm sure I can rely on your
	          discretion.  Do you understand?
	
	                    CONCIERGE
	              (passing the key to
	               Viktor)
	          Oh, I understand.
	
	As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card
	to the mirror.
	
	ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
	
	The Concierge picks up his phone.
	
	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR enters the hotel suite.  We see a montage of scenes --
	Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
	
	A)  VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in
	    the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
	
	B)  VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
	
	C)  VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
	
	D)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
	
	E)  VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
	
	F)  VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
	
	G)  In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
	    a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
	    rocket.
	
	H)  VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
	    scatters it on the counter.
	
	I)  VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
	    bouncing into the toilet bowl.  He retrieves it.
	
	J)  VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
	    jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
	    rear entrance.
	
	K)  VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
	    shadow on the drapes.  A "walking" silhouette is visible
	    to the media on the street.
	
	L)  VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
	    LOVE YOU V--".
	
	VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door.  He looks at
	his watch.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (peering through the
	               peephole)
	          Who is it?
	
	                    WOMAN'S VOICE
	              (from other side of door)
	          It's... Simone.
	
	Viktor smiles.
	
	EXT.  HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
	YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.  A HOTEL DOORMAN
	keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
	
	Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.  The coated woman
	starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not yet.
	              (scrutinizing the crowd)
	          Where's "Matinee"?  There they are. 
	          Okay, I think everyone's here. 
	          Now!
	
	Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
	providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
	paparazzi.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          Simone!
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Over here, sweetheart!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 3
	          Come one Simone, take it off, baby!
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 4
	          We got a job to do!
	
	The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER and
	MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo
	screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
	following.
	
	The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
	
	                    PHOTOGRAPHER 1
	          I think I got a piece of her ear.
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          I didn't get shit.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (emerging from the pack,
	               to Max)
	          Ten feet from a living Goddess...
	
	INT.  MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE.  His assistant, MILTON,
	begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for
	fingerprints, etc.  Max rubs pencil into the impression on
	the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of
	life is that it ends".
	
	                    MAX
	              (interrupting Milton's
	               work)
	          Leave me for a moment.
	
	Milton and the Concierge depart.
	
	Max is alone.  He looks around the room.
	
	A)  MAX enters the bathroom.  He picks up a drinking glass
	    and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
	    plastic bag.
	
	B)  MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
	    it in a plastic bag.
	
	C)  MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
	    before placing it in a plastic bag.
	
	D)  MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
	
	E)  MAX enters the bedroom.  He carefully removes a slip from
	    a pillow.  He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
	    in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
	
	F)  Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed. 
	    He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same
	    sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
	
	MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI
	in their wake.  Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
	head.
	
	Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not
	Simone.  FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy.  Viktor
	and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
	limousine.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (not quite able to avert
	               his eyes from her
	               telescopic legs)
	          Thank God for you, Faith.  I know
	          this is above and beyond the call
	          of duty for a stand-in.  You don't
	          know what a service you're
	          performing for Simone -- shielding
	          her from those animals.
	
	                    FAITH
	          No, thank God for you, Mr.
	          Taransky.  How many men would go
	          to so much trouble to protect a
	          woman?
	
	Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
	intimate position.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You understand you'll have to come
	          back to my place to keep them off
	          the, er...
	              (his nose close to Faith's
	               neck)
	          ... scent.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Of course.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          You look so, so...
	
	                    FAITH
	          ... so much like her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course, but very beautiful
	          in your own right.
	
	                    FAITH
	          I do find myself physically
	          attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
	
	Their lips are now tantalizingly close.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Viktor.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely
	followed by FAITH on top of him.
	
	Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous.  Viktor
	hardly resists.  In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith
	murmurs in his ear.
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do whatever you do to Simone.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What?... What did you say?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Do what you do to Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What I do to Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	          Yes, call me Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (still tearing at his
	               clothes)
	          Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what
	          you do to Simone.  I want to know
	          what it's like to be her just for
	          one night.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          You're with me to be close to her?
	
	                    FAITH
	              (panting)
	          Is that a problem?
	
	As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's
	deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".
	
	                    FAITH
	          "Why are we here?  Is that what
	          you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
	          here?  No why.  Just here".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (this is too much for
	               Viktor)
	          Please put your clothes on
	
	Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to
	straighten her clothes.
	
	EXT.  FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY
	
	The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.
	
	INT.  SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
	
	VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
	ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmerized
	by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends.  The
	light go up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood
	          Foreign Press is going to eat this
	          up.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	              (turning to his daughter)
	          What did you think, Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          One thing bothered me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          No, not that.  I was just wondering
	          -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
	          why did Simone have no reflection
	          when she walked in front of that
	          mirror?
	
	Viktor is shocked, busted.  He covers it with a laugh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen-faced)
	          I wondered if you'd spot that. 
	          You've got a good eye, Lainey.  I'm
	          proud of you.
	
	Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I got them to remove the
	          reflection.  The mirror's metaphor 
	          -- to show how her character's
	          inwardly dead.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's genius, Viktor.  Was that
	          Simone's idea?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sarcastic, annoyed at the
	               suggestion)
	          Who else?  It's always Simone's
	          idea.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (not quite convinced)
	          So that accounts for the lack of a
	          shadow in reel six?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Precisely.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
	outside the theater.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (as she gets into the car)
	          Good-night, Daddy.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (kissing Lainey good-bye)
	          Night, Lainey.
	
	Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (drawing Elaine aside)
	          Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
	          idea for Lainey to come to the
	          screenings -- mature content and
	          all that.
	
	Both look to Lainey.  From inside the car Lainey watches her
	parents.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (impressed by his
	               responsible attitude)
	          Maybe you're right.
	              (gently teasing)
	          Twelve years after your daughter's
	          born you decide to become a father.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Better late than never.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (softening)
	          I should fire you more often.  The
	          film's looking wonderful.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You really think so?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes.  To be honest I never quite
	          saw this film before -- maybe it's
	          the way Simone is playing it -- but
	          what it's saying about the illusion
	          of permanence in everyday life, how
	          that's the only way we can love --
	          I think it's really going to mean
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you
	          liked it.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to tell her myself.
	              (cajoling)
	          When are you going to let me meet
	          her?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Soon.  Soon.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Everyone I know has met her,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Everyone you know is lying.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (amused)
	          That's true.
	
	They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before. 
	However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
	shutter from a nearby bush.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damnit!
	
	The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You know how you can stop that. 
	          She has to get out more.
	              (climbing into the car)
	          See you at the premiere.
	
	Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE - DUSK
	
	The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
	hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".  Red carpet, klieg lights
	searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
	
	A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out.  The
	crowd screams with excitement.
	
	Viktor waves.  Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
	their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
	car door... but nothing.  The door shuts.  A disappointed
	murmer.  The limo drives off.
	
	VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 1
	              (talking to camera)
	          -- What a night!  Anyone who's
	          anyone is here at the premiere of
	          "Eternity Forever," but waiting for
	          Simone to show may take even
	          longer.  We do have her director,
	          Viktor Taransky.
	              (ushering him over)
	          Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               focus on the star)
	          You know Simone.
	
	Other reporters force their way into the interview.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          I hope she does show up.  Some of
	          her fans got here at dawn.  We
	          don't want to disappoint them.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (through a pained smile)
	          Well, I'm sure they're going to
	          love the movie.  I got the
	          inspiration --
	
	However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          HARRY EPSON!
	
	The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.  Screen idol, HARRY
	EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a
	          minute?  What brings you here
	          tonight?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (waving to the fans)
	          I just came out to support my good
	          friend, Simone.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	          There's a rumor that you're more
	          than just "good friends"?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (slightly irritated by the
	               invasion)
	          We've been seeing each other, sure,
	          but we'd rather keep our
	          relationship private.
	
	                    PREMIERE REPORTER 2
	              (believing she has a
	               scoop)
	          Do I hear the sound of... wedding
	          bells?
	
	                    HARRY
	              (suddenly losing it)
	          I can't believe you people!  No
	          wonder she never comes to these
	          things!
	
	Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
	carpet.
	
	VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
	
	EXT.  PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
	
	A packed, glitzy party.  VIKTOR enters without an escort. 
	Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
	alone.
	
	He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
	schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
	
	                    MOVER/SHAKER
	          Elaine!  The picture is a
	          revelation!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank you.  I mean, it was a team
	          effort --
	
	Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
	pocket camera.  Elaine is unaware of the shot.
	
	Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
	
	Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.  A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
	unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
	Daniels.  She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
	glasses off the bar.  Viktor catches it.
	
	A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.  HAL stands there
	accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
	
	                    HAL
	          Is she here?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
	
	                    HAL
	              (oblivious to his sarcasm)
	          Somebody said she was here.
	
	Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
	lipstick-smeared.
	
	                    MAC
	          Oh my God, that's her glass!
	              (impulsively smelling
	               "Simone's" glass)
	          Jack Daniels, straight-up.  She is
	          my kind of woman.
	
	                    HAL
	              (looking anxiously around
	               the room)
	          Viktor, where is she?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's around.
	
	                    MAC
	              (dawning on him, glancing
	               to the far side of the
	               packed room)
	          Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
	          Room.
	
	                    HAL
	          You know I sometimes forget she has
	          bodily functions.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (unable to resist)
	          I know what you mean.
	
	                    HAL
	              (anxiously looking to the
	               restroom)
	          I have to talk to her about my
	          experimental film.  It's very...
	          experimental.
	
	                    MAC
	          Is that her? -- By the fountain.
	
	Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
	her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (testy)
	          No.  In fact, between us, she
	          doesn't really exist.
	
	                    HAL
	              (ignoring him, calling out
	               to the woman)
	          Simone!
	
	                    MAC
	          SIMONE!
	
	Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.  They talk
	over each other.
	
	                    GUEST 1
	          -- Simone's here!
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (slightly the worse for
	               drink)
	          -- When did she arrive?  Why didn't
	          someone tell me?
	
	                    GUEST 2
	          -- Where is she?
	
	                    MAC
	          -- She's by the fountain.
	
	                    GUEST 3
	          -- Simone, over here!
	
	                    GUEST 4
	          -- Simone!
	
	The rumor races through the party like wild-fire.  The GUESTS
	surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
	
	The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
	
	                    LOOKALIKE WOMAN
	          Simone!
	
	She gets knocked into the fountain.  Several other GUESTS
	also fall in the stampede.
	
	Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
	his station.  Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.
	
	LOCAL TV NEWS
	
	The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
	with ambulances.  PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
	battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	              (into microphone)
	          -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
	          big news tonight was the surprise
	          appearance of Simone.  Even these
	          seen-it-all superstars are
	          apparently not immune to Simone
	          fever and the resulting stampede
	          forced organizers to bring the
	          event to an early end.  I spoke
	          with some of the departing guests
	          about their encounter with
	          Hollywood's most reluctant
	          superstar.
	
	CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- I would say, even more beautiful
	          in person, you have to see her to
	          believe her.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 1
	          -- I can't reveal what we spoke
	          about.  It was... personal.  Simone
	          and I go back a long way.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 1
	          -- When she talks to you, for that
	          moment, you are the only other
	          human being in the room.
	
	                    FEMALE GUEST 2
	              (dress torn)
	          -- I really don't know what the
	          fuss is about.  So over-rated. 
	          She's done one film.  Talk to me
	          when she's had the kind of career
	          I've had.
	
	                    MALE GUEST 2
	          -- I do expect her to be nominated,
	          yes.
	
	We return to the live shot of the ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.
	
	                    ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
	          Fortunately, Simone was not amongst
	          the injured and was spirited away
	          as mysteriously as she arrived.
	
	EXT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building.
	
	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated.  He paces back
	and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- She goes to a major, Hollywood,
	          A-list party and we don't get an
	          interview, a comment, we don't even
	          get a photograph?  Is that what
	          you're telling me?
	
	                    ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
	          Nobody got a photograph.  Nobody
	          ever gets a photograph.
	
	                    MILTON
	          We've got our best people on it,
	          Mr. Sayer.
	
	                    MAX
	          24-hour tail on Taransky?
	
	                    MILTON
	          Shutter bugs camped outside any
	          place he goes, every concierge and
	          maitre d' on the take.  But this
	          Simone woman is good.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to a
	               "Confidential" FBI
	               report)
	          Obviously the name isn't real --
	          she's using an assumed identity,
	          travels under a false name, checks
	          into hotels with an alias.  She
	          never stays in the same place two
	          nights in a row.  Anything on the
	          satellite photos?
	              (irritated)
	          What about the fingerprints?  What
	          happened when we dusted that hotel
	          suite?
	
	MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Well, we got some of Taransky's
	          fingerprints, a lot of your
	          fingerprints... but none of hers.
	
	                    MAX
	              (interest piqued)
	          Which means they're significant.
	              (beat)
	          Incriminating.
	              (beat)
	          Perhaps, criminal.
	              (getting excited)
	          She's hiding her past.  She's
	          hiding her past.
	
	Max ponders the revelation.
	
	                    MAX
	          Of course -- no one's that perfect,
	          that pure.  You know I had
	          something on Mother Teresa.  But
	          then she died and it wasn't worth
	          it anymore.
	              (approaching a computer)
	          I know how to flush out this Simone
	          -- a tell-all story from her
	          childhood.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (impressed)
	          My God, you've got one?
	
	                    MAX
	              (offering Milton a seat in
	               front of the computer)
	          I will when you're finished writing
	          it.
	
	MILTON hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	              (disappointed in his
	               protege)
	          Am I wasting my time with you? 
	          When she sues to protect her
	          privacy, she'll have to appear in a
	          public courtroom to do it.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (under his breath)
	          Long live the First Amendment.
	
	                    MAX
	          Sometimes you have to tell a small
	          lie to get to the bigger truth.
	              (to his nervous
	               photographer)
	          As for a photo -- if you can't do
	          it, I know twelve million people
	          who can.
	
	CLOSE UP on The Echo magazine -- "CIRCULATION - 12 MILLION".
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY
	
	"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the
	headline on the cover of The ECHO.  VIKTOR is reading the
	magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
	
	He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
	soundstage.  A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
	trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".  VIKTOR runs towards
	the door, throwing himself between the door and the
	executives.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- You can't go in there!
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- We know she's in there!
	
	Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (struggling to hold them
	               back)
	          -- Why?  What's all this about?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (waving a spreadsheet)
	          -- We've got the tracking numbers
	          for "Eternity Forever".
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- They're in the toilet.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- She has to get out there and
	          sell the film.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- What do you want her to do, go
	          door-to-door -- ?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          -- Even Garbo would be on the talk
	          show circuit if she was alive
	          today.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (irritated)
	          -- It's precisely because she
	          doesn't crave the limelight that
	          people love her.  I told you, she's
	          only about the work.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          -- This is over-shadowing the work!
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	              (waving the front page of
	               The Echo)
	          That's the problem.  She's more
	          famous for her no-shows than her
	          shows.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- It's starting to look like she
	          doesn't support the film or you,
	          Viktor.
	              (trying to squeeze past
	               Viktor)
	          If you can't handle her, I will.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blocking her path)
	          Not now.  She's emotional.  Her
	          mother dies today.  Scene forty-two
	          of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a
	          good time.
	
	Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
	Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Please, don't go in there!
	
	Too late.  Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted
	with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the
	vast soundstage.  A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          Where is she?
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          She's not here.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine... I...
	
	Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing
	smile.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          So, the secret's finally out,
	          Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I can explain.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- I don't think that's necessary. 
	          I think it's perfectly clear.  I
	          should have guessed -- it all makes
	          sense now... it's why she never
	          goes anywhere, never seen in
	          public...
	
	Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She's into computers.
	
	Viktor looks up.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (nodding in agreement)
	          Probably spends her whole life in
	          chat rooms.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's the one place she can be
	          herself.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 3
	          Anonymous.
	
	Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (adopting a serious tone)
	          It's worse than you think.  She's
	          extremely agoraphobic -- has a
	          morbid fear of people and germs. 
	          In a way I'm relieved you... found
	          out.
	
	The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          The premiere was the first time
	          I've convinced her to venture out
	          and it just confirmed her worst
	          nightmares.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (concerned)
	          Viktor, you should have said
	          something.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She doesn't want pity.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (seeing a new side of
	               Viktor)
	          You're so good to protect her like
	          this.
	
	Viktor shrugs modestly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the Executives,
	               conceding)
	          I'll tell you what.  I know how
	          much this means to you.  I'll try
	          to get her to plug the film.
	              (beat)
	          I'm not promising anything but
	          maybe she'll do a talk show --
	          taped.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. 
	          She'll never go to them.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	          We understand.  Thank you, Viktor.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          Give her our best.
	
	Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the
	soundstage.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 1
	              (aside to a colleague)
	          That agoraphobia -- it's like a
	          plague.
	
	                    EXECUTIVE 2
	          It's out of control in Europe.
	
	Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
	          introduce you to Simone at the
	          premiere.  There wasn't time with
	          the riot and everything.
	              (picking up a framed photo
	               from the work station)
	          But she wanted you to have this.
	
	The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the
	premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          She was there.  She didn't by any
	          chance happen to mention me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She said you were very beautiful.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (flattered)
	          Really?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (blurting out)
	          Elaine, what are you doing tonight? 
	          Would you like to go somewhere --
	          dinner?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'd love to.  But aren't you
	          supposed to meet up with Simone?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I
	          always?
	
	Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
	
	Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National
	ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF
	SIMONE"!  Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX
	SAYER.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods
	aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.
	
	We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while
	at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
	
	INT.  SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
	
	Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV. 
	However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart.  She wears
	sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf.  Simone takes
	a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of
	cereal off a display.
	
	INT.  ECHO OFFICES - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER watches the video in his office, enraptured.  He
	rewinds the tape and replays the moment.
	
	                    MAX
	          She likes Apple Jacks... just like
	          me...
	
	Assistant MILTON enters.  He looks ill.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer...
	
	                    MAX
	              (irritated at being
	               interrupted)
	          What do you want -- ?
	
	                    MILTON
	          Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million
	          bucks yet?
	
	                    MAX
	              (never averting his eyes
	               from the screen)
	          -- Cashier's check went out to our
	          anonymous tipster this morning --
	          worth every penny too.  Who says
	          there's no place for checkbook
	          journalism?  We'll be running
	          stills of this for months, then
	          release the whole tape -- we'll get
	          our money back -- maybe show it on
	          an exclusive pay-per-view event. 
	          Do you realize what we have here? 
	          We have the only independent
	          footage of Simone in existence.
	
	                    MILTON
	          We used to.
	
	Max's head snaps around.
	
	                    MILTON
	              (holding a copy of the
	               L.A. Times Calendar
	               section - "Simone Live")
	          She's doing Frank Brand on
	          Thursday.
	
	Max coughs.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get out.
	
	A TV
	
	The opening credits to "FRANK BRAND LIVE", a global cable
	show plays against a starscape -- images of famous
	politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	              (to camera)
	          Tonight on Frank Brand Live --
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's
	mansion with eager anticipation.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Since taking the nation by storm
	          with her debut movie, "Sunrise,
	          Sunset"...
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          ... no one's managed to land a live
	          TV interview with the fabulous, new
	          shooting starlet, Simone... until
	          now.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
	from The ECHO.
	
	VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
	final test of his equipment.  When he touches his hair, bats
	his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
	
	VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
	SIMONE from a library of images.  Rainforest.  Desert.  Ritzy
	hotel suite.  Moonscape.  Factory.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Make up your mind, Viktor.  Make up
	          your mind.
	
	He settles on the desert location.
	
	He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --
	selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          I'm happy to say she's agreed to
	          join us tonight from the set of her
	          new film.
	              (turning to the TV
	               monitor)
	          Welcome, Simone.
	
	The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's
	monitor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that
	Elaine is in the room.
	
	                    KENT
	          She is all woman.
	
	LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look.  She
	gets up and leaves the room.
	
	During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,
	Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including
	Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide
	locations --
	
	A)  A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
	
	B)  A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
	
	C)  A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well, no one could accuse you of
	          being over-exposed, Simone.  Why
	          have you stayed so completely out
	          of the limelight?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (shrugs)
	          I just think actors talk too much. 
	          Does the world really want to hear
	          your life story just because you've
	          got a movie opening Friday?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Of course, the only problem with
	          shying away from publicity these
	          days is that it tends to attract
	          more.
	
	VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
	frighteningly convincing.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Don't I know it.  That's the only
	          reason I'm here now -- to put the
	          attention back where it belongs, on
	          Mr. Taransky's film.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          You don't secretly want the
	          attention?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm not even sure I deserve it. 
	          After tonight I'll have almost as
	          much screen time on your show as I
	          do in my movies.  How is that
	          healthy for a performer?
	
	IE.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to
	look through a book.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          Because, you have to understand,
	          Frank, these interviews -- none of
	          this is real.  Who I am on screen
	          and who I really am are two totally
	          different people.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Who are you really?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          That's a good question.
	              (beat)
	          As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man
	          strives long and hard to appear
	          someone else..."
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (reading from a bookmarked
	               page, along with Simone)
	          "... he ends up finding it is
	          difficult to be himself again."
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Well put.
	
	Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor
	Taransky".
	
	INT.  MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
	
	TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
	leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
	
	                    MAX
	              (focusing on the desert
	               background behind Simone)
	          I know where that is... I know...
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Change of topic.  Simone, you've
	          been romantically linked to dozens
	          of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,
	          Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...
	          and most recently Viktor Taransky. 
	          Is there a Mr. Right in there
	          somewhere?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'd rather not discuss my private
	          life.
	              (gently)
	          But Viktor and I are inseparable.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.
	
	                    KENT
	          You dog, Viktor!
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from TV)
	          I literally wouldn't be here today
	          without him.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
	excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command.  SIMONE'S
	EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Would you like a moment, Simone?
	
	Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
	startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          No, I'm okay.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          Let's talk about the work that you
	          care so much about.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Sure.  Where would you like to
	          start?
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          How about the nudity?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Nudity has just never been an issue
	          for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are
	          just an option.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          What exactly was it that attracted
	          you to your first two projects?
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (unable to resist a smile)
	          I suppose the thing I like most
	          about the movies I'm in is that
	          they're not about special effects.
	
	Frank nods sagely.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          They're better for it if I may say.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking
	alert:
	
	        !!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
	
	The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.  Curiously, it
	is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	              (regarding the screen)
	          Well, we appear to be experiencing
	          satellite difficulties.  In case we
	          lose you, Simone, I want to thank
	          you --
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Thank... YOU, FRANK.
	
	In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.  The feed goes
	blank on Frank Brand's screen.
	
	VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion.  Since SIMONE
	is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
	Simone also slumps.
	
	Viktor's cell phone rings.  Viktor picks up.
	
	                    VIKTOR / SIMONE
	          Hel--
	
	He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
	synthesizer.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (into phone)
	          Hello.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
	the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
	TV.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- Viktor, are you with her?  Is
	          she there?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No.
	
	An anxious beat.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Are you and Simone...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... getting married?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (taken aback by the
	               suggestion)
	          No, of course not!
	              (realizing the
	               significance of the
	               question)
	          Why?  Would you care if we were?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (covering, realizing she
	               has given herself away)
	          Well, yes.  From a studio point of
	          view, it would be better if Simone
	          stayed single.
	              (quick change of topic)
	          Anyhow, I thought she came across
	          great tonight.  Intelligent, well
	          informed, a natural.  And touching. 
	          She was spectacular.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.
	
	A pause.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, do you realize you always
	          do that?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Do what?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Whenever I compliment Simone, you
	          take the credit.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I do?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes, you do...
	              (shrug)
	          Anyway, tonight was a good start.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excuse me?  Start?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          It's a crowded summer.  We need
	          every photo-opp, sound-byte and
	          column inch we can get.  Good
	          night, Viktor.
	
	Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (carefully broaching the
	               subject)
	          Mom, do you miss Dad?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (she thinks)
	          Sometimes.  But, just when I think
	          your father's changing for the
	          better, I realize he's as self
	          absorbed as ever.  He took the
	          credit for Simone tonight.
	
	Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
	Nietzsche book in her hand.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I think Dad deserves more credit
	          than he gets.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen.  He is unusually anxious.
	
	As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
	she awaits instructions on the screen.  For some reason
	Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Simone)
	          Will you cover yourself up!?
	
	He hits a button.  A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
	
	EXT.  NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
	
	The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
	desert.  MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've been here before! -- On my
	          honeymoon with my ex-wife.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Is that why she left you?
	
	Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
	interview.  He compares her desert location to the one in
	front of him.
	
	                    MAX
	              (pointing out a Joshua
	               tree)
	          You see, that's the exact same tree
	          and in the distance, there's the...
	              (voice trailing away)
	          ... mountain.
	
	Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
	now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
	
	Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
	
	                    MILTON
	          It's a hotel.
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't understand.
	
	                    MILTON
	          Could they have built that hotel
	          since yesterday?
	
	Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
	
	                    MAX
	          Get in the car.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
	publicity machine.  The floor is littered with photographs of
	SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
	
	Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
	constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
	spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular
	Mechanics".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (angrily into phone)
	          -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
	          don't get the cover... written
	          answers to written questions,
	          that's right... website interviews,
	          no problem.
	
	Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION".  Choosing from a HULA
	DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
	Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina. 
	She begins to dance for him.
	
	He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
	SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
	
	He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
	With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
	beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (muttering to himself)
	          You want exposure, Elaine?  I'll
	          give you over-exposure...
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
	
	ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change channels
	without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
	answers.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think "Eternity Forever" is my
	          finest work.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I'm most proud of my work in
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I think people are going to love
	          "Eternity Forever".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" costume.  He speaks to the photo.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Forgive me, Simone.
	
	EXT.  FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
	
	The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
	cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
	Meals.  Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
	in a convertible.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY
	
	         "ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!
	
	Screams the banner headline in "Variety".
	
	            $$$IMONE - WINS 6TH WEEKEND IN A ROW
	
	Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
	
	The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR
	who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly
	at Simone.
	
	INT.  SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Of course, being a movie star is
	          wonderful, but I have so many other
	          ways I want to express myself --
	
	INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY
	
	Various book titles are on display:
	
	            "SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"
	
	            "HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"
	
	                 "SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"
	
	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
	
	A banner in a window reads.  "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
	FASHION".  Mannequins model the clothes.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
	
	  SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
	
	  PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
	
	A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly
	appears on the screen along with photographs of the
	artists --
	
	PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,
	CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title
	of each song is a graphic representation of the music --
	"PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
	
	Viktor presses a button: "MORPH".  The audio waves converge.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song. 
	As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
	sings.  The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".
	
	SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
	
	INT.  RECORD STORE - DAY
	
	The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside
	the record store.  TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance
	adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are
	gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
	
	INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
	shoots up the Billboard charts.
	
	EXT.  OCEAN - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
	luxury yacht.
	
	VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
	a moment to savor his success.  Simone's hit single plays on
	the yacht's stereo.  He looks at peace.
	
	EXT.  MARINA - DAY
	
	A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
	taken.  However, we discover that the Simone is only a
	lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
	snapshots.  He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
	ELVIS.
	
	MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
	
	Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
	sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
	
	                    MAX
	          Nice boat, Taransky.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's a yacht.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know what you're up to.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (pushing past Max)
	          I don't have time for this, Sayer.
	
	                    MAX
	          I think you do.
	              (holding up his video
	               print of Simone in the
	               desert)
	          I know it's a fake.
	
	Viktor freezes.
	
	                    MAX
	          Got your attention now?
	
	Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
	with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to the
	               photographs)
	          It's bogus.  You used an old
	          library shot for the background.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ashen)
	          The background is.
	
	                    MAX
	          She was never in New Mexico.  She
	          never left the studio.
	
	Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
	the background.
	
	                    MAX
	              (referring to a large
	               bundle of other shots
	               under his arm)
	          I've done my homework.  I've
	          studied her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- I bet you have.
	
	                    MAX
	          -- I've looked at every piece of
	          publicity she's ever done, the
	          video in the supermarket, there's
	          no evidence she's ever left the
	          studio.
	              (afterthought)
	          Oh, and for some reason this woman
	          leaves no paper trail.  But I have
	          "obtained" a copy of your bank
	          accounts.  I know you have power of
	          attorney but so far you haven't
	          transferred one single solitary
	          cent to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm keeping it in trust.
	
	                    MAX
	          I know that's what you'd like us to
	          believe.  But I got to tell you --
	          embezzlement is a serious matter. 
	          Not to mention abduction.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Abduction?
	
	                    MAX
	          I don't buy the whole recluse scam. 
	          How are you doing it?  What is it --
	          drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? 
	          All three?  What do you do -- keep
	          her locked in a box somewhere?
	
	Viktor flinches at the remark.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	          I want to see her.  Unless you show
	          me Simone live and in person I show
	          these pictures to the authorities.
	
	Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
	
	                    MAX
	          Er,... good.
	
	                    MILTON
	          That's good.
	
	Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
	
	The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
	into the sea.
	
	INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
	
	A vast, empty stadium.  On the stage, a lone microphone. 
	VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena.  Several
	PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          All ready, Mr. Taransky.  This time
	          tomorrow night, she'll be standing
	          right here in front of a packed
	          house.  We could have sold it out
	          twenty times.
	
	Viktor nods.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	          Soundcheck went perfect.  Laser
	          show ready to go.
	              (cautionary note)
	          I gotta say, you ordered an awful
	          lot of smoke.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's the way she likes it.
	
	The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,
	where a barrier has been erected.
	
	                    PROMOTER
	          After what you told us about the
	          death threats, the security guards
	          are under strict instructions never
	          to take their eyes off the crowd.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Excellent.
	
	Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a
	kiss.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Simone wanted you to have these.
	
	                    TECHNICIAN
	              (visibly moved by the
	               gesture)
	          Wish her luck from us.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, I will.
	              (afterthought)
	          Remember, no cameras, no
	          binoculars.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
	truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
	from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck.  The
	control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation
	Tour.  NO ENTRY".
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.  On
	his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.
	
	                    CROWD
	          ... SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!  SI-MONE!...
	
	Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his
	jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.
	
	SIMONE appears on the monitor.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Let's get you into hair and make
	          up.
	
	Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes
	grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints
	across the lids.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Wardrobe.
	
	Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes
	appearing to fabricate themselves on her body.  He settles
	for the most provocative outfit.
	
	Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor
	showing --
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands,
	stomping their feet and chanting.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Easier to make one hundred thousand
	          believe than just one.
	
	He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the
	"ENTER" key.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	Smoke fills the stage.  A strobe light show plays.  A booming
	ANNOUNCER is heard.
	
	                    ANNOUNCER
	          Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor
	          Taransky Promotions is proud to
	          present, live on stage, for the
	          debut concert of the "Splendid
	          Isolation" tour, the one, the only,
	          SI-MONE!
	
	A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
	alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
	accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage.  However, on
	closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
	creating a hologram.  Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
	the illusion.
	
	The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
	the enormous video screens on either side of the stage.  The
	CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that
	they are watching a pre-recorded event.  Some watch the event
	on portable TVs.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	CLOSE UP on the computer screen.  VIKTOR scrolls down a list
	of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (from on stage)
	          I love you...
	
	He selects "L.A.".
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... L.A.
	
	The crowd roars its approval.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          It's great to be here.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --
	begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In
	Yourself) Believe In Me".  A verse of the song is sung in
	perfect Spanish.
	
	EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
	
	A)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
	
	B)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to
	    SIMONE.
	
	C)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his
	    passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
	crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
	tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
	aloft.  For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
	the grand illusionist.  Viktor is at the height of his
	powers.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to the image of Simone on
	               his screen)
	          I don't know about you, Simone, but
	          I've never felt more alive.
	
	He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the
	Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
	stand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn!
	
	He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the
	TV screen, apparently fails to notice.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
	
	We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER.  His
	journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing
	along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept
	up in the moment.
	
	INT.  STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
	
	SIMONE finishes her final number.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Good-night.  Never stop believing.
	
	EXT.  STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
	
	A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars. 
	FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
	
	S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE
	BOYS.  Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"
	T-shirts and carry posters.  Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a
	TV NEWS CREW.
	
	                    FAN 1
	          -- I swear, she looked right at me.
	
	                    FAN 2
	          -- She was, like, ethereal.
	
	                    FAN 3
	          -- One moment she seemed to walk
	          right through her mike stand like
	          it wasn't even there.
	
	INT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	The chanting crowd can be heard exiting.  VIKTOR, wearing
	lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with
	Simone's signature kiss.
	
	He is interrupted by a knock at the door.  Viktor irritably
	opens it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I said I didn't want to be
	          interrupt --
	
	EXT.  CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a
	SECURITY GUARD nearby.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (face brightening)
	          My two favorite girls.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Lainey and I just wanted to
	          congratulate...
	
	Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          ... Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (suddenly cool)
	          I can imagine.
	
	Viktor is confused by their reaction.  Elaine yanks Lainey
	away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Thank Simone for the tickets.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (calling back as she is
	               led away)
	          It was a great show, Dad...
	
	Viktor waves disconcertedly.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Where are you... going?
	
	As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
	lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
	trailer door.  He slams the side of the trailer in
	frustration.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
	
	ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-
	runs of the SIMONE concert.  KENT cannot take his eyes off
	the screen.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I can't believe she's doing this --
	          taking advantage of him this way. 
	          It's cruel.
	
	                    KENT
	          Why?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Obviously, this can't last.  She's
	          going to dump him.  Viktor won't be
	          able to take that.  He's too
	          sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
	
	                    KENT
	          Elaine, do you realize you can't
	          stop talking about Viktor?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (not hearing)
	          I have to talk to her.
	
	Kent switches off the TV.
	
	                    KENT
	          I've been meaning to talk to you.
	
	Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
	
	VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
	at the breaking waves.  LAINEY joins him.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Hey, Lainey.
	              (gently teasing her)
	          How's your love life?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I do okay.  How about you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You know me -- married to my work.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I noticed.
	
	An awkward silence.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Dad, you know I don't like to get
	          between you and mom but she's
	          feeling down right now.  She broke
	          up with Kent.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (buoyed by the news)
	          Really?  Too bad.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          She thinks you're with Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
	          have a real relationship.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if
	          it came from Simone, if Simone
	          spoke to Mom -- she could
	          straighten things out.
	              (shrug)
	          Dinner, maybe.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A
	          phone call?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Too impersonal.  They have to meet
	          face-to-face.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'll see what I can do.
	              (a thought occurs)
	          You know, Lainey.  I don't believe
	          you've ever once asked to meet
	          Simone.  Don't you like her?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love her but that doesn't mean I
	          need to meet her.
	
	Viktor is confused.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why?  So I can tell my friends at
	          school -- as if that validates my
	          life somehow.  What's Simone going
	          to say to a fourteen-year-old
	          anyhow?  She's going to be polite
	          because you're my father but we're
	          not suddenly going to become
	          friends -- we have nothing in
	          common.  It's not going to be real. 
	          Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
	          my head every day.  Why kill the
	          dream?  What do they say, "don't
	          get too close to your idols, they
	          always disappoint you".
	
	Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
	her years.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I love you, Lainey.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I love you too, daddy.
	
	A car horn sounds outside the house.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          That's Mom.
	              (kissing him on the
	               forehead)
	          See you.
	
	She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.
	
	EXT.  LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
	
	Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car
	radio.  ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along
	the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Her car phone
	rings.  She turns down the radio and picks up.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Hello?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Hello, is this Elaine?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you,
	          Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk
	          to you.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Well, here I am.
	              (beat)
	          You look pretty today.  Red suits
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (looking around the
	               freeway)
	          Where are you?
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Right beside you.  I borrowed
	          Viktor's car.
	
	Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
	phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewhat
	mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as they
	talk.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
	
	The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the
	driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
	mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
	
	Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the
	car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
	with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
	ahead.  He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm
	          late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor
	          now.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          No, I understand.  That's what I
	          want to talk about.  I don't know
	          if you know this, Simone, but
	          Viktor and I were married once.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I can't imagine how you ever let a
	          man like that go.  I owe Viktor
	          everything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I think he owes more to you.  But
	          that's not important now.  I know
	          what's going on between you two.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I want to reassure you, Elaine,
	          there's absolutely nothing going on
	          between Viktor and I.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rueful smile)
	          You don't have to protect my
	          feelings, Simone.  I don't blame
	          Viktor for falling in love with the
	          most desirable woman in the world.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (breaking character)
	          I'm not --
	              (correcting himself)
	          He's not.
	
	Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across
	his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at
	the last second.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          My God, are you alright, Simone?
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Damn --
	              (struggling to stay in
	               her/his lane)
	          Yes -- I --
	              (regaining control)
	          -- I'm just a little tired. 
	          Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --
	          it's strictly a working
	          relationship.  We could never be
	          anything else.  We're just so...
	          different.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  You're a household name
	          now.  You're moving in entirely
	          different worlds.  That's why I
	          hope you're not toying with Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          It sounds like you still have
	          feelings for him.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          We have a daughter together.  I
	          just don't want to see Viktor get
	          hurt.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          I don't know how many times I have
	          to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and
	          I are not in love.
	              (joking weakly)
	          I only make love to the camera.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Simone, I recognize the shirt
	          you're wearing.  I gave it to
	          Viktor on his birthday.
	
	Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next
	lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
	to avoid him.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Christ --
	              (still struggling to stay
	               on the road)
	          Elaine, I know how it looks but...
	              (blurting it out)
	          ... it would mean a lot to Viktor
	          if you'd go with him to the Oscars. 
	          If you won't do it for him, please
	          do it for me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (reluctant, frightened by
	               Simone's erratic driving)
	          Okay -- for you.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	              (sigh of relief)
	          Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm glad we talked.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          Good-bye.
	
	Viktor's car swerves to the right.  Elaine looks back in her
	rearview mirror, concerned.
	
	Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the
	truck in front of him.
	
	EXT.  FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
	
	VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the
	fender-bender.  However, the Patrolman is more interested in
	the Simone mannequin.
	
	                    PATROLMAN
	          You don't have to explain.  I know
	          what the press is like.  Lunatics. 
	          Out of control.
	              (referring to the Simone
	               mannequin)
	          You do know I'm going to have to
	          take this?
	
	INT.  ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed
	auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE". 
	ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.
	
	HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best
	Actress" envelope.
	
	                    HAL
	          And the winner is...
	
	Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he
	reads the name.
	
	                    HAL
	          Actually, there's a tie.
	
	The AUDIENCE gasps.
	
	                    HAL
	              (milking the moment for
	               all it's worth)
	          The winners are... Simone for
	          "Sunrise, Sunset"...
	
	The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their
	applause.
	
	                    HAL
	              (big smile)
	          ... and Simone for "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	The audience erupts.  Viktor accepts the congratulations of
	those around him.
	
	                    HAL
	          Unfortunately, Simone can't be with
	          us tonight.
	              (turning to the screen)
	          But thanks to the miracle of modern
	          technology she is able to join us
	          live via satellite from the
	          location of her new film.
	
	The screen flickers to life.
	
	ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY
	
	SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland
	location chosen by Viktor.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Thank you!  Thank you!  This means
	          so much to me.  I'm just sorry I
	          can't be there with you.
	              (wiping away a tear)
	          First off I have to acknowledge my
	          fellow nominees -- I don't even
	          feel I belong in the best actress
	          category let alone with these...
	          wonderful human beings.
	              (composing herself)
	          I also have to thank my co-stars,
	          the studio, of course.  But most of
	          all, I have to thank the audience
	          for supporting what I do -- you're
	          the only reason I'm here.
	
	The CROWD applauds wildly.
	
	LAINEY is puzzled.  She leans over to Viktor.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Why didn't she thank you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (confused)
	          She did... didn't she?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (crestfallen)
	          No.
	
	Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him.  The blood
	drains from his face.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING
	
	On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the
	speech.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          ... And of course I must thank my
	          collaborator, Viktor Taransky,
	          without whom none of this would be
	          possible.
	
	VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen. 
	He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          It's written right there... Why
	          didn't I say it?... How could I
	          forget to say it?
	
	Simone stares back at him blankly.
	
	A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door.  The
	front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At
	Oscars".
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home.  MAX is
	standing outside next to his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Damn it!
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
	the car, MILTON closeby.  Viktor stops at the gate and
	reluctantly exits his car.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          What now, Sayer?
	
	                    MAX
	              (smug smile, noticing
	               Viktor noticing the
	               woman)
	          Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No
	          one comes from nowhere, Taransky. 
	          You turn over enough rocks...
	
	The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
	
	                    MAX
	          I traced her to a nursing home.  A
	          young woman fitting Simone's
	          description dropped her off five
	          years ago.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She looks a lot like you.
	
	                    MAX
	              (undeterred)
	          She hasn't uttered a word that
	          whole time -- until she saw the big
	          show.
	
	Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Simone's
	               picture, catatonic)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	                    MAX
	              (putting his hand on his
	               heart)
	          Who would think that "Saint Simone"
	          would abandon her own mother?  I've
	          been looking into the family
	          history -- heartbreaking.  Most
	          likely a biography to run over four
	          issues... who knows, maybe there's
	          a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
	
	Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in
	front of the old lady.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	              (pointing to Viktor's face
	               on the driver's license)
	          My baby... My baby...
	
	Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
	
	                    MAX
	          That doesn't prove a thing -- wait
	          until I get a court order for a
	          blood test.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (sensing an opportunity)
	          That won't be necessary.
	              (pretending to be
	               resigned)
	          Sooner or later I knew you'd crack
	          this thing, Max.  You got me.
	
	                    MAX
	          I do?
	              (recovering)
	          Sure I do.
	              (taking Viktor aside)
	          Can we speak off the record?  I'm a
	          fair man.  I'm willing to sit down
	          with her and tell her side of the
	          story.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I wouldn't want you to compromise
	          your ethics.
	
	                    MAX
	          No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
	
	Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You love her, don't you, Max?
	
	                    MAX
	          Don't you?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (writes a check, hands it
	               to Max)
	          This should take care of Mother.
	
	Viktor drives into his home.  Max, very confused, stares at
	the old lady.
	
	EXT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his
	soundstage.  He removes the blindfold.  From Lainey's point-
	of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY
	FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you
	          like it?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (taking in the car)
	          It's fantastic -- it's too much.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the car she drove in "Eternity
	          Forever".
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know.  Thank her for me.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (disappointed by her
	               reaction)
	          It's from both of us.  Of course
	          you'll have to drive it around the
	          lot until you get your permit --
	
	Lainey averts her gaze.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- I can't accept it.  I don't want
	          a car, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (clearly hurt, not
	               understanding)
	          Why not?  I can get you something
	          else.  What do you want?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          The old Viktor Taransky.
	              (finally blurting it out)
	          I liked you better before -- before
	          all this.  You were a loser, Dad,
	          but at least you had integrity.  I
	          can't stand to see you like this --
	          clinging to Simone's coattails --
	          it used to be about the work, and
	          now it's all about her.  And then
	          she's not even grateful enough to
	          thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, that was me.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          There you go again, blaming
	          yourself.  Can't you see what she's
	          done to you -- she's taking
	          advantage, mocking you.  You
	          deserve better than Simone.
	              (hasty exit)
	          I've got to go, Dad.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Lainey...
	
	Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's
	remarks.  JANE enters.
	
	                    JANE
	          Ready for your casting session?
	
	Viktor nods distractedly.  Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
	
	                    JANE
	          Nicola's here for the role of
	          Simone's sister.
	
	Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has
	never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
	Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (slightly uncomfortable by
	               Viktor's scrutiny)
	          A lot's happened since we last saw
	          each other.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (numb)
	          Yes.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          I never apologized properly for
	          what happened on "Sunrise".
	
	She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &
	Ike candy, including cherry.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Thank you.  It's not important.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          After I saw what Simone did with
	          the role -- you know I fired all my
	          people, went into rehab, took
	          acting classes, changed my whole
	          look.  She really inspired me.
	
	Viktor continues to stare.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (referring to the script
	               in her hands)
	          Would you like me to read?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, I'd like that.
	
	Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down. 
	She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the
	scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (her angry words are in
	               opposition to her amorous
	               actions)
	          -- Who do you think you are, Carlos
	          -- coming in here like this?  With
	          my husband sleeping in the next
	          room.  Do you think I won't call
	          out?  Do you think I will just give
	          in to you without a fight -- like
	          the last time and the time before
	          that?
	              (she kisses his ear)
	          I wish you were dead.
	              (she kisses his lips)
	          I wish we were both dead.
	
	Nicola immediately breaks character.
	
	Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
	flesh.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (finally able to speak)
	          You know you're really very good. 
	          I take back what I said.  I mean,
	          you're really good.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Thank you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (forgetting himself)
	          You could play the lead.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (confused)
	          But that's Simone's part.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Yes, of course it is.
	              (gazing at her face)
	          You know you have a line here.  Not
	          a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a
	          dimple.  I've been thinking of
	          incorporating something like that
	          in Simone.
	
	                    NICOLA
	              (incredulous)
	          You'd cosmetically alter Simone to
	          look like me?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, of course not, you're right. 
	          That would be crazy.
	
	Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          Do you want me to do it again?
	
	Viktor does not reply.  Nicola quietly leaves.
	
	INT.  ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
	
	The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
	photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
	satellite.  However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
	picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
	Ceremony.
	
	Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
	
	EXT.  SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
	
	Old home video of ELAINE.  She is in a garden by a swimming
	pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera. 
	Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
	operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
	kiss to the camera.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
	Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
	monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
	
	Viktor freezes the tape.  Elaine appears particularly
	beautiful.
	
	Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
	it into Simone.  Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
	dazzling smile.
	
	INT.  SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle
	as she talks on the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone)
	          -- Oh sure, she comes in all the
	          time... we've become close.  She
	          told me --
	
	VIKTOR enters the office.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Jane --
	
	Jane hurriedly hangs up.
	
	                    JANE
	          Gotta go.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (picking up a pile of
	               scripts from the in-tray)
	          I'm leaving early tonight.  If you
	          need me I'll be at the beach house
	          having dinner with a... certain
	          someone.
	
	Jane tries to conceal her interest.  As soon as Viktor exits
	the office, JANE picks up the phone.
	
	                    JANE
	              (into phone, under her
	               breath)
	          ... Elaine Christian please.
	
	We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
	assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.  The doorbell
	rings.
	
	He checks himself in the mirror.  In the reflection, he spies
	an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE. 
	He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
	
	ELAINE stands there.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
	
	Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Elaine, it's Wednesday.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (feigning absent
	               mindedness)
	          Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. 
	          How embarrassing.  I don't know
	          what I was thinking.  With all the
	          excitement lately...
	              (peering past him)
	          Am I interrupting something?  Are
	          you expecting company?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (ushering her inside)
	          As a matter-of-fact I am.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          When is she coming over?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (glancing to his watch)
	          About now.  Would you like a drink?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I suppose I could stay, just until
	          she arrives.
	
	Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glass of
	wine and sits beside her -- close.
	
	They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
	apparently in need of courage.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to make
	               conversation)
	          Is Simone back to earth yet?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not quite.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. 
	          She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
	              (blurting out)
	          Is she really having your baby?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Impossible.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (instantly regretting the
	               remark)
	          I just read somewhere --
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know.  I know.  They'll say
	          anything.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          -- And she was positively glowing
	          at the awards.
	              (making to leave)
	          I should be going, she'll be here
	          soon --
	
	Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She already is.  Simone's not
	          coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight,
	          not ever.
	              (holding her)
	          I want you back, Elaine.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (melting)
	          I want you back too, Viktor.
	
	They kiss.  Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with
	doubt.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? 
	          I can't compete with Simone.  What
	          woman can?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I would rather have you than
	          Simone.  Believe me.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          That's sweet, Viktor, but I
	          couldn't let you do that -- make
	          that kind of sacrifice.
	              (meeting his gaze)
	          It's strange.  I've stabbed people
	          in the back, clawed and slept my
	          way to where I am -- it goes with
	          the territory -- but, for some
	          reason, I can't betray Simone. 
	          There's... I don't know any other
	          way to say it -- there's a goodness
	          to her.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, there isn't.  There's nothing
	          to her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Oh, Viktor.  You say that now --
	          because we're here, alone, like
	          this.  But in the morning, you'd go
	          back to her.  What man wouldn't?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No, I will end my relationship with
	          her -- totally.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          But you don't understand.  She'll
	          always be there -- at some party,
	          on some magazine cover, some song
	          on the radio, up on some screen.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (desperate)
	          No.  She'll never work again --
	          retire, never make a movie or a
	          record, or appear ever again.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (confused)
	          Of course she will.  Her public
	          will demand it.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Not if I don't let her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You?
	
	Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I'm going to tell you a secret now,
	          Elaine.
	              (mustering all his nerve)
	          Simone is not a real person.  I
	          invented her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (misinterpreting his
	               remark)
	          Every actor is an invention,
	          Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. 
	          No one's denying that you
	          discovered Simone.  But it's like
	          finding a diamond in the desert. 
	          Anyone can trip over it, but it's
	          not the finder who sparkles.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (agitated)
	          -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. 
	          You don't understand --
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (ignoring him)
	          -- You just got lucky that she's
	          loyal enough to stay with you. 
	          Maybe she's staying out of pity,
	          who knows?  She certainly doesn't
	          need you.  Some people even say
	          you're holding her back.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (wounded)
	          Who says that -- ?
	              (shaking off the insult)
	          -- Never mind.  You have to listen
	          to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air,
	          pixels, molded by me from a
	          mathematical equation.  I inherited
	          it from a madman -- I can show
	          you --
	
	                    ELAINE
	          How much wine have you had?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- She's a figment of my own
	          imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky,
	          have perpetrated the greatest hoax,
	          the greatest sleight-of-hand,
	          sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
	          sleight in entertainment history!
	          And still no one appreciates me,
	          recognizes what I've done -- even
	          you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (rolling her eyes)
	          You're drunker than I thought.  Are
	          you doing that again?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!  Whatever talent Simone has
	          comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear,
	          as God is my judge.  You don't know
	          what I've been through.  Tens of
	          thousands of mind-numbing hours in
	          front of that screen, nights
	          without end, and look what it's
	          cost me.
	              (producing his spectacles)
	          Why do you think I've been wearing
	          these?  I may have done irreparable
	          harm to my eyesight, and why?  To
	          extract and refine the infinite
	          nuances of a human being -- a human
	          soul.
	              (a final explanation)
	          Don't you see?  I made Simone!
	
	A pause.  His words hang in the air.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          You made Simone?
	              (a trace of pity)
	          Viktor, she made you.
	
	Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
	alone in his house.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	
	A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office.  Suddenly, he stops and
	confronts the standee of SIMONE.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You bitch!  I'll destroy you!
	
	JANE stares in shock.  She discreetly exits.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
	SIMONE.  He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
	
	MONTAGE:
	
	A)  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
	    VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash.  Max finds a
	    beat up reel of 16mm film.
	
	    MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
	
	B)  The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
	    shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
	    compromising position.
	
	    VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
	    overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          Disgusting...
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	              (sympathetic)
	          She must have been so desperate to
	          do something like that, so
	          depraved.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          I'm still naming my baby after her.
	
	                    WOMAN 2
	          You're having a boy.
	
	                    WOMAN 1
	          So?
	
	    Viktor blanches.  It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
	
	C)  Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
	
	    ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
	    farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
	    for muddy vegetables.
	
	    The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
	    spontaneous applause.
	
	    Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
	    "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
	
	D)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
	    behind him.
	
	                    FILM CRITIC
	          For Simone to do something as brave
	          as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
	          career, with so much to lose -- all
	          I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
	          Oscar".
	
	E)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
	    wrinkles to Simone.
	
	F)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
	    on a TV screen.  However, her squeaky-clean image has
	    gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
	    during the interview.  The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
	
	                    HOST
	          Simone, that's a rather
	          controversial position.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I just think all elementary schools
	          should have a firing range -- so
	          students can learn how to defend
	          themselves.  We could fit it
	          inbetween recess and American
	          History.
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          If there's a hole in the ozone
	          layer why can't I see it?
	
	Another clip:
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Immigration?!  God, isn't it
	          crowded enough?!
	
	                    HOSTS
	          Just as we always knew.  Simone's
	          not like other celebrities.  She
	          speaks her mind!
	
	G)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
	    brakes, almost causing an accident.  He stares numbly up
	    at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
	    billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE.  It
	    reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to himself)
	          She's trying to kill me.
	
	Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
	
	EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY
	
	An inscription on a headstone reads:
	
	                         HANK ALENO
	                Remembered Virtually Forever
	
	VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.  He places a bunch of flowers
	there.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (referring to the flowers)
	          They're plastic, Hank.  I know
	          that's the way you'd want it.
	              (glancing to a Simone
	               billboard outside the
	               cemetery wall)
	          She killed you, Hank.  Now she's
	          killing me.  She's a serial killer.
	              (ducking out of sight of
	               the billboard as if
	               Simone is watching him)
	          But I don't know how to stop her. 
	          She's taken on a life of her own. 
	          I can't just come clean -- make
	          some confession.  I've defrauded
	          millions -- they'd turn on me.  And
	          I can't put the genie back in the
	          bottle.  If she stopped working --
	          dropped out of sight, they'd never
	          let it rest.  I've tried to kill
	          her career but they like her even
	          more.
	              (more desperate)
	          What am I going to do, Hank?
	
	A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind
	Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Don't say another word, Hank.  You
	          are truly a genius.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
	
	A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,
	SIMONE's face full screen.
	
	He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
	automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
	he puts his words in her mouth.
	
	                    SIMONE / VIKTOR
	          What's the matter, Viktor?  You
	          look so sad.  Don't you love me
	          anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
	
	He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It's the only way, Simone.  If it's
	          any consolation, you're going to
	          live on in the public's heart like
	          all the other tragic figures that
	          went before their time.  There's no
	          love like posthumous love.
	
	On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I know what you're thinking.  It's
	          a phoney-baloney world.  The women
	          are surgically enhanced, the
	          athletes are on steroids, the
	          singers are lip-syncing if they're
	          even singing at all, the news is
	          entertainment, the politicians are
	          bought and paid for -- we're living
	          one big lie.  So why shouldn't you
	          live too?  You're more authentic
	          than the people who adore you.
	              (a trace of despair)
	          And that's the problem.  You're
	          looking at the real fraud.  I told
	          myself this was all about the work
	          but if that was the truth, it
	          wouldn't matter to me -- and it
	          does.  It wasn't that the artists
	          had no respect for the art.  They
	          had no respect for me.  Someone
	          like you, you have so much love
	          showered on you -- I just wanted to
	          feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm
	          sorry, Simone.  Here I've been
	          trying to convince the world that
	          you exist, but I was really trying
	          to convince them that I exist. 
	          It's not that you aren't human,
	          Simone, it's that I am.
	
	Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
	8.1".  He places the disc in the machine.
	
	Viktor sees that Simone is crying.  He touches a tear on his
	own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
	
	Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
	"ENTER".  The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
	deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold. 
	The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
	like dust.  Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
	digital breath.
	
	For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
	his own desk.
	
	Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen. 
	His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
	marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
	
	He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
	hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software.  He shuts
	the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.
	
	EXT.  SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
	
	Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
	Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
	
	VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing.  A mournful pause
	-- then he heaves it over the side.  The trunk sinks like a
	stone.
	
	Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
	
	EXT.  STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
	
	A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS.  A somber VIKTOR
	enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It is my sad and solemn duty to
	          announce the tragic passing of
	          Simone.
	
	A gasp from the audience.  Then, an explosion of anguish.
	
	                    CROWD
	          No!!  What happened?!  Oh.  God.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 1
	              (stepping forward,
	               mustering the courage to
	               ask the question)
	          How did she die?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          A rare virus.
	              (pretending to compose
	               himself)
	          On her goodwill tour of the third
	          world.
	
	                    PRESS REPORTER 2
	          Did she suffer?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Mercifully, it was quick.
	
	At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON.  They are
	frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
	
	A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
	
	A)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
	
	B)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news
	    shows around the globe.
	
	C)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several
	    yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property
	    including the driveway.  VIKTOR insensitively drives over
	    the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX
	    SAYER and MILTON.
	
	D)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd
	    around a television showing a live picture of Simone's
	    funeral.
	
	E)  The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral
	    procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the
	    studio lot.  Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto
	    the hearse.
	
	F)  The same television picture is playing on a television
	    sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river.  LOCAL WOMEN
	    stop washing their clothes to watch.
	
	EXT.  GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
	
	We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an
	island in a lake.
	
	Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
	from the studio.  Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
	
	VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
	the coffin.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (to Elaine)
	          Can I see you later -- go away for
	          the weekend?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (horrified by the
	               suggestion)
	          How can you bring that up at a time
	          like this?
	
	The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum.  A
	PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor.  He nods
	and they start to carry the coffin towards the door. 
	However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
	
	A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid.  The
	coffin lid is pulled back.  Inside is a life-sized cardboard
	standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
	
	The MOURNERS gasp.  Everyone looks to Viktor.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
	
	A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:

	          -- He was a controlling madman, she
	          was a prisoner.  I blame myself...
	          I should have done more to stop
	          it...
	
	B)  NICOLA gives a statement.
	
	                    NICOLA
	          -- It was strange.  He wanted to
	          replace her with me in his new
	          movie... and I know I'm not that
	          good.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE. 
	Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots,
	interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards
	from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls,
	stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and
	television appearances.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          -- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm
	          just trying to understand.  All
	          these films, TV appearances,
	          magazine covers, internet
	          interviews, publicity photos,
	          snapshots from her childhood -- all
	          fake.
	              (referring to various
	               items)
	          This is fake, this is fake -- fake,
	          fake, fake, all fake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          That's right.  You understand
	          perfectly.  I will confess to
	          fraud, not murder.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (referring to oversize
	               mail bags)
	          A fan club with a worldwide
	          membership in the millions -- also
	          bogus?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But
	          they were worshipping computer code
	          -- ones and zeros.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          So, of course, you couldn't kill
	          Simone because there never was a
	          Simone.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Of course.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you
	          talk so much about, a renowned
	          failure, who also happens to be so
	          conveniently dead -- perhaps the
	          "man" you claim helped invent
	          Simone is an invention himself?
	
	Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (patronizing smile)
	          But not everyone's imaginary, are
	          they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of
	          course, to Edith.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          Who?
	
	The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door
	room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being
	interviewed.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          The woman you admitted to a
	          journalist is Simone's mother and
	          for whose silence you paid a
	          fortune?  Is she not flesh to you --
	          are her tears not wet?
	
	The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone
	through the window.
	
	                    OLD LADY
	          My BABY!
	
	The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.  Viktor rolls his
	eyes at the Detective's theatrics.  He is suddenly enraged.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          She's insane!  This whole thing is
	          insane!  There is no Simone.  Look!
	              (grabbing a Simone poster)
	          Even her name is fake.  It's not
	          Simone.
	              (he tears Simone's name in
	               half to demonstrate)
	          It's SIM... ONE!  Simulation One!
	
	The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
	
	                    DETECTIVE 2
	              (regarding Simone's face
	               also torn in half)
	          You really hated her, didn't you?
	
	The Detective places a tape, marked "EXHIBIT A" in a video
	machine.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Perhaps you could explain this to
	          me, Mr. Taransky -- or is this tape
	          "doctored" too?
	
	He plays a tape showing --
	
	EXT.  MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
	yacht.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          It's footage from the marina's
	          closed-circuit camera on the night
	          in question.  Altered, of course. 
	          Is that really what you expect us
	          to believe, Mr. Taransky?
	
	The Detective freezes the tape.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Can you tell us why you were
	          disposing of the body of a woman
	          who didn't exist?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It wasn't her body.  It was her
	          body of work.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          Why don't you just come clean,
	          Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll
	          feel better afterwards.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I am telling the truth.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (coming close to him)
	          We all know what happened.  In a
	          fit of jealous rage you killed
	          Simone and dumped her body off a
	          boat she bought for you.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll
	          take you to her.
	
	EXT.  BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
	and his LAWYER.  DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk. 
	Viktor's face lights up.
	
	The trunk is winched aboard.  However, as it lowers onto the
	deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar.  All
	eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted.  Apart from
	a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (panicky, desperately
	               grabbing the divers)
	          Did you find anything else --
	          drivers, discs... disc-drives?
	
	                    DIVER 1
	          Nothing.
	              (gazing to the water)
	          We couldn't stay down any longer.
	
	All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the
	water.
	
	CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:
	
	           "SIMONE"S BODY FEARED EATEN BY SHARKS"
	
	The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting
	opposite Viktor in his cell.  VIKTOR is numb -- the
	likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          -- Plead guilty and throw yourself
	          on the mercy of the court.  It's
	          the best deal you're going to get.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (incredulous)
	          I could get the death penalty.
	
	                    LAWYER
	          You certainly will if you go to
	          trial -- a jury in this kind of
	          ugly mood.  You've killed an icon,
	          for God's sake.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,
	          there was no one to kill!
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (musing)
	          An insanity defence.
	
	INT.  VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
	
	A FIGURE sits at Viktor's computer.  LAINEY.  She scrolls
	through Viktor's files.  All empty.
	
	Lainey sighs.  ELAINE paces behind her.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing
	          here.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Just a minute.
	
	Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.
	
	                    ELAINE
	          God, it's so like your father.  Why
	          can't people take responsibility
	          for their actions anymore?  I can
	          almost forgive him for killing
	          Simone -- but denying her
	          existence.  I can never forgive
	          that.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Because obviously she existed,
	          right?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          I know it as surely as you're
	          sitting here, sweetheart.  She was
	          the most vital woman I ever met.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          So you did meet her?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Of course.  What are you
	          suggesting?
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I mean really meet her -- in the
	          flesh.
	
	Elaine regards her daughter curiously.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          I know it's embarrassing to admit
	          it, mom, but when I think about it 
	          -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it
	          feels like I have.  I know more
	          about her than members of my own
	          family.  She's even in my dreams. 
	          But I realized, going back through
	          my diary, they were all TV
	          appearances, near misses at
	          parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
	          on the internet.  I've never
	          actually seen Simone up close,
	          touched her, been in her physical
	          presence.  Have you?
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (unable to refute it)
	          Well, I --
	
	                    LAINEY
	          -- We don't believe daddy because
	          we don't want to believe we were
	          taken in too.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (trying to shake the
	               notion from her head)
	          Lainey, there's no evidence that
	          Simone isn't real.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Listen to what you're saying, mom. 
	          Is there any evidence she is?
	
	Lainey finally tries another file.  She presses "EJECT".  The
	"PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (regarding the disc)
	          There's one part of dad's story
	          that may have been true.  Simone
	          may have contracted a virus.
	
	Lainey smiles at her mother.
	
	                    LAINEY
	          Certain viruses can be cured.
	
	INT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - POLICE CELL - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething,
	while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy.
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (hushed tones, referring
	               to a thick Psychiatric
	               Report)
	          ... Listen, I've found a
	          psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
	          respected -- who's willing to
	          testify under oath that you have
	          diminished capacity due to the
	          trauma of your divorce, ten years
	          of abject failure in the movie
	          business and a bump on the head you
	          sustained as a child --
	
	VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          -- No!  I can't go along with this
	          horseshit!  Just tell them they can
	          fry me!
	
	                    LAWYER
	              (aghast, looking around to
	               see if anyone has heard)
	          What?!
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          It was premeditated -- I knew
	          exactly what I was doing!  I
	          strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! 
	          I set her on fire!  I did it!  I
	          killed her!
	
	                    DETECTIVE (O.S.)
	              (clearing his throat)
	          Excuse me.
	
	The Lawyer spins around guiltily.  The Detective stands
	outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession. 
	Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	          I think you'd better see this.
	
	The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the
	cell.  VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" --
	
	INT.  TELEVISION STUDIO - "VBC" - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
	
	                    VBC ANCHOR
	              (from TV)
	          -- Breaking news -- international
	          media star, Simone, is alive and
	          well.  Her studio released this
	          footage only minutes ago...
	
	EXT.  STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
	
	The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times --
	headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE"
	and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
	
	The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
	on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.  She
	winks to the camera.
	
	                    VBC ANCHOR
	          ... Simone reading today's edition
	          of the L.A. Times.  Who says, "The
	          only bad publicity is your
	          obituary"?  Details at the top of
	          the hour.
	
	The TV is switched off.  Viktor stares at the screen, trying
	to take it in.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	          You're indestructible.
	
	When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding
	the cell door open.
	
	                    DETECTIVE
	              (shaking his head in pity)
	          I'll never get you Hollywood
	          people.
	
	EXT.  L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
	
	A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a
	sea for VIKTOR, released from custody.  One placard reads,
	"ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".  He is escorted to a waiting
	limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.  He hugs them
	both.
	
	INT.  LIMOUSINE - DAY
	
	VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studying
	her laptop computer.  Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed
	against the glass.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (relaxing back into his
	               seat)
	          Thank you!
	              (to Lainey)
	          I don't know how you did it but
	          thank you.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (putting her arm around
	               him)
	          Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. 
	          You know what we have to do?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (resigned smile)
	          Why stop at one character when you
	          can have a whole cast?
	
	                    ELAINE
	          Exactly.  Now that you have the
	          studio behind you, we can really do
	          things.
	
	Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (holding Viktor close)
	          I was thinking -- what about you
	          and... "Simone" moving back in with
	          me and Lainey?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (meeting her gaze)
	          That sounds wonderful.
	              (to Lainey)
	          How do you feel about all this,
	          Lainey?
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (beaming)
	          About you and mom?
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (reluctant admission)
	          Me and Simone.  What I did.
	
	                    LAINEY
	              (sweet smile)
	          Your mistake wasn't making
	          something fake, daddy.  We're fine
	          with fake -- as long as you don't
	          lie about it.
	
	Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth. 
	Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
	forces its way through the reporters.
	
	He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob.  Max has
	hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
	window --
	
	"WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE".  Viktor looks away.
	
	                    ELAINE
	              (kissing him on the cheek)
	          Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's
	          not a death sentence.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (still staring out of the
	               window, a rueful smile)
	          No... it's life.
	
	INT.  FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY
	
	FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who
	appears as usual on a television monitor.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          -- Simone, the question on
	          everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
	
	                    SIMONE
	          Frank, you know as well as I do,
	          living in a fish bowl, the
	          insatiable appetite of the media...
	
	Frank nods sympathetically.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          With everything that was going on
	          in my life, I just needed to drop
	          out of sight for a while -- I
	          needed time.  Viktor bought me that
	          time.  I owe him so much.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          We all do.
	              (quickly returning to
	               Simone)
	          But now I understand you're eager
	          to get back to work -- and not the
	          kind of work that we're all
	          expecting.
	
	                    SIMONE
	              (smiles coyly)
	          That's true.  I can reveal that I
	          am considering a career in
	          politics.
	
	                    FRANK BRAND
	          And what may I ask brought this on?
	
	SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
	
	                    SIMONE
	          I suppose this little man had
	          something to do with it.  Viktor
	          and I are both concerned about what
	          kind of world our new son, Chip, is
	          going to grow up in.
	              (turning lovingly to
	               Viktor)
	          Aren't you, Viktor?
	
	On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal
	VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
	
	                    VIKTOR
	              (turning lovingly to
	               Simone)
	          Yes.
	
	INT.  SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
	
	Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded. 
	VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his
	soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there --
	he is alone.
	
	CUT TO BLACK
	
	INT.  CONCERT STADIUM - NIGHT
	
	DURING THE CLOSING CREDITS SIMONE PERFORMS ANOTHER SONG FROM
	HER CONCERT TOUR -- "(YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE) A NATURAL
	WOMAN".

     SISTER ACT

     FADE IN:

     INT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM
     We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late 
     Sixties.  The children all wear uniforms and sit at little 
     desks.  SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room; 
     she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.  The children are 
     all terrified of her.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Who can name all the Apostles?  Yes?

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER

     A thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk.  She raises 
     her hand.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine?

                               CHRISTINE
               Sister, may I be excused?

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine...

                               CHRISTINE
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

     Sister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips.  Christine 
     stands and heads for the door.

     
                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. GIRLS ROOM

     Christine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room. 
     She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror.  She has 
     taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it 
     out.  She applies lipstick.

     Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a 
     stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on.  She 
     unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse.  
     She sprays herself with dime store cologne.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. HALLWAY

     Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways.  
     No one is around; she saunters down the hall.

     Page 2.

     ANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET
     Christine opens this door.  She looks into the closet. 
     There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for 
     her inside.

                               CHRISTINE
               Hi, Jimmy.

     Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door 
     behind her.

     ANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA

     Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her 
     eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand.  She 
     flings open the broom closet door,

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY

     in the broom closet.  Jimmy's face is covered with 
     lipstick.  Christine's hair is awry.  The couple has 
     clearly been making out.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
                             (outraged)
               Miss Christine Carter!  Again!  Don't 
               you know what happens to girls like you?  
               Don't you know what they become?

     INT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED 
     POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY)

     Taped over a crack on a wall.  The poster shows a 
     glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER:  singing star of a fifth-
     rate Vegas lounge.  Christy wears tight spangles and a 
     major wig on the poster.  She has clearly lived up, or 
     down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations.

     The CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the 
     poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, 
     casting a red and blue haze over the premises.  A dressing 
     room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail 
     polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry 
     are scattered everywhere.

     We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in 
     the dark.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go.  
               It was great.  Like usual.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               It was twenty minutes.  Like usual.

     Page 3.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               The best.

     VINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing 
     and checking his hair.  Vince is a powerful, charismatic 
     man who rules an organized crime empire with personal 
     magnetism and threat.  Vince's hold over Christy is 
     obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous 
     one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.

                               VINCE
                             (half to Christy, half 
                             to the mirror)
               You are something else.

     Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.

                               CHRISTY
               Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can 
               talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, 
               we'll have fun.  And you still haven't 
               told me what happened.  What did she say?

                               VINCE
               What did who say?

                               CHRISTY
               Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.

     Vince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm.

                               VINCE
               You are so damn sexy.

                               CHRISTY
               Vince...

                               VINCE
               How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, 
               five years we've been together?  Who do I 
               thank?

                               CHRISTY
                             (not buying it)
               Today was the deadline, Vince.

     Vince sits on the bed.  He takes Christy's hand, and 
     kisses it.

                               VINCE
               I want us to be together.  Like people.  
               Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of 
               God.  Babe, today... I went to 
               confession.

                               CHRISTY
               You did what?

     Page 4.

                               VINCE
               For the first time in I don't know how 
               long.  I wanted everything done right. 
               Open and above board.  I told Father 
               Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it 
               was a special love, for all the ages.

                               CHRISTY
                             (starting to fall for 
                             it)
               You said that?  And what did he say?  
               Did he say you could leave her?  Did he 
               say we'd be happy?

                               VINCE
                             (looking deep into her 
                             eyes)
               He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn 
               in Hell.  For all eternity.

     Vince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away 
     and starts putting on his shoes.

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (outraged)

                               VINCE
               You want me to go against a priest?  Get 
               excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?

                               CHRISTY
               You bastard!

                               VINCE
                             (trying to calm her)
               We can still see each other.  Just like 
               always.  It's a different kind of sin. 
               Smaller.

                               CHRISTY
               You pig!

     Vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket.

                               VINCE
               Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's 
               God!

                               CHRISTY
               You lying sleazeball!  The best years of 
               my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?

     Vince ducks as Christy throws an ashtray at him, and it 
     smashes against the wall.

                               VINCE
               You're upset.  I understand.  I should 
               go.  I hate to.

     Page 5.

     A CLOCK-RADIO hits the wall beside Vince's head.

                               CHRISTY
               Get out of here!  And never come back!

     A LAMP hits the wall, as Vince dodges it.  He makes a 
     phone gesture with his hand.

                               VINCE
               I'll call.

     Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy. 
     He leaves.

     Christy is left standing on the bed, holding a 
     particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl.  
     With Vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed 
     animal. She is caught between tears and rage.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

     ANGLE on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden 
     Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc.  Scrunched in 
     between two larger hotels and casinos is the MOONLIGHT 
     HOTEL AND CASINO.  The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's 
     just seen better days.

     INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

     A spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage.  The 
     man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an 
     Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks 
     and style.

                               ELVIS
               Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Are 
               you lonesome tonight?  Welcome to the 
               Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible 
               Platinum Oldies Spectacular.

     Backstage, there's still a look of resolve in Christy's 
     eye as she waits to go on with MICHELLE and TINA, her back-
     up singers.

                               MICHELLE
               But you can't quit.  What'll happen to 
               us?
                             (to Tina)
               Tell her she can't quit.

                               TINA
               I told her.  She stuck pantyhose in my 
               mouth.

     Onstage, Elvis glances into the wings to be sure the 
     Ronelles are ready.

     Page 6.

                               ELVIS
               Please welcome our own girl group 
               extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty --
               the fabulous Ronelles!

     Elvis disappears.  The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a 
     high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style 
     gown.  Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs.  The 
     band begins a doo-wop vamp.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, girls.

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               This prom is a real drag.

                               RONELLES
               Oh-huh.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my!
                             (gasping)

                               RONELLES
               What is it, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               Look at that.  Get a gander.

                               RONELLES
               Oh my!
                             (sighing)

                               CHRISTY
               He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek 
               god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's 
               boss.  He's fab.  He's...

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
                             (singing)
               HE'S SO FINE.

                               RONELLES
               D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.

                               CHRISTY
               WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY 
               OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.

     As they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully 
     choreographed in vintage girl group style.

     Page 7.

     A lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the 
     number.  While Christy does her best, her singing voice is 
     not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.

     The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few 
     drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.  POLICE 
     LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his 
     eyes locked on Christy.  An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives 
     her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a 
     turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.

     INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

     A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a 
     sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own 
     dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a 
     few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are 
     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw this dump.  It's a roach motel 
               with sequins.  Every guy I meet is either 
               married, a cop, or a lush from Des 
               Moines.

                               MICHELLE
               But what about us?

                               TINA
               You taught us the act.  The songs, all 
               the moves.

                               CHRISTY
               And where did it get me?  I'm stuck in 
               this rathole!  You're holding me back, 
               just like Vince!  I should be headlining!

     A pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and 
     leans into the room.

                               CHRISTY
               What do you want?  This is a private 
               area!  Get lost!

                               JOEY
               You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.

                               CHRISTY
               Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit 
               the road.

     Joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the 
     chair near Christy.

                               JOEY
               From Vince.

     Page 8.

                               CHRISTY
               His ashes?

                               JOEY
               With love.

     Joey leaves.  Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very 
     excited.  They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy.

                               MICHELLE
               From Vince! With love!

                               TINA
               Michelle and Tina can't restrain 
               themselves: they open the box.  Inside is 
               a rather gaudy fur coat.  Michelle and 
               Tina are impressed.

                               MICHELLE
               It's a fur!

                               TINA
               It's new!

                               CHRISTY
               It's a bribe.  Five years of my 
               goddamned life!

                               MICHELLE
               So you earned it!

                               TINA
               Vince owns the casino!  Cash in

                               CHRISTY
               I should throw this in his facet

     There's a KNOCK on the door, and Tina opens it.  
     Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters.  Christy is not pleased.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, Jesus.  What is going on here?
                             (to heaven)
               Why me?  Whose dog did I kill?

                               MICHELLE
               Hi, Lieutenant.

                               TINA
               Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie picks up the coat.

                               EDDIE
               From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo-
               lang.

                               CHRISTY
               At least he's not a cop.  At least he 
               can afford a decent gift.

                               EDDIE
               I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your 
               birthday .  When we were seeing each 
               other.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, 
               that your mother picked out?  Lottery 
               tickets?  A travel iron?

                               EDDIE
               So I don't shop.

                               CHRISTY
               'Cause you're always out, arresting 
               people.  Making trouble.  I don't know 
               why I went out with you in the first 
               place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't 
               hold my head up, I used to tell people 
               you were a security guard!

                               EDDIE
               Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt?  
               You were singing in bowling alleys back 
               then.  I told people you were a hooker!

                               MICHELLE
               Calm down, you two.  It's always like 
               this.

                               EDDIE
               Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' 
               better class of people.  Vince Laflocca.

                               CHRISTY
               He's a businessman.

                               EDDIE
               A what? When are you qonna wake up?

                               CHRISTY
               When are you gonna get off my case?  
               Have you got a search warrant?  What do 
               you want -- cheap thrills?

                               EDDIE
               Information, baby.  I thought maybe 
               somebody around here might have a 
               conscience.

                               CHRISTY
               Think again!  And get out of here.

     Page 10.

                               EDDIE
               I'm going.  My regards to Vince,   And 
               the Mrs.

     Christy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head.  He 
     ducks, and the jar hits the door.

                               EDDIE
               Ladies.

     Eddie leaves.  Christy is standing, absolutely furious.

                               CHRISTY
               That's it!  I'm not taking it from him, 
               and I'm not taking it from Vince!  From 
               now on, it's all about me!  And if I 
               can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with 
               it -- it's gone.  Like Sister Immaculata 
               used to say, "Life is short, and then you 
               fry."  So long, girls -- see you in 
               church!

     Christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     ERNIE SCHMIDT sits across the enormous mahogany desk from 
     Vince.  The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating 
     bullets.  The presence of Joey the weasel and WILLY, a 
     brutal thug, increases Ernie's tension.

                               VINCE
               Ernie Schmidt.  How long you been with 
               us, Ernie Schmidt?

                               ERNIE
               Three years, Mr. LaRocca.  One behind 
               the bar, two as croupier.

     Vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings.

                               VINCE
               Ernie, you know what's important to me?  
               What counts?  It's not all this.  This is 
               '-- what?  Frosting.  Loyalty.  That's me, 
               Ernie.  That's home.

     Vince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and 
     points it at Ernie's head.

                               VINCE
               You ain't been loyal, Ernie.  What did 
               you tell the cops?

     Ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer 
     to his temple.

     Page 11.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY

     Holding the coat, Christy waits by the elevator.  It 
     arrives; she gets in.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     The interrogation continues.

                               ERNIE
               I didn't tell the cops anything. I 
               swear.

                               VINCE
               Joey?

     Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of 
     office cubicles with half-wall partitions.  The floor is 
     deserted and dark as she makes her way through the 
     cubicles.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     Vince is standing over Ernie, holding his head up by the 
     hair.

                               VINCE
               Who else, Ernie?  Who else was in on it?

                               ERNIE
                             (moaning)
               No one...

                               VINCE
                             (dropping Ernie's head 
                             in disgust)
               Why am I wasting my time?

     INT. EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

     Beyond the cubicles, Christy strides down a lush corridor 
     to an executive suite.  She tries the knob, but finds the 
     door locked.  Pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the 
     door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a 
     reception area and doors to several inner offices.  She 
     tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk.

                               CHRISTY
               Won't need that anymore.  Ta-ta.

     Crossing to Vince's office, Christy squares her shoulders 
     and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the 
     doorknob.  She pauses for a second, and then doubles her 
     resolve.

     Page 12.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

                               VINCE
               Do it.
                             (to Joey)

     ANGLE on the door to the office, which opens.  Christy 
     appears, with the mink coat in her arms.

                               CHRISTY
               Stuff this up your...

     A GUNSHOT is heard, 0.S.  Christy's eyes widen, and her 
     jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed.

     ANGLE on the office.  Ernie is slumped in the chair, dead. 
     Joey stands over him, holding the revolver.  Joey, Willy 
     and Vince stare at Christy.

                               VINCE
               Babe.
                             (icy calm)

     Christy tries to speak; she can't.

                               VINCE
               Christy.  Is there a problem?  With the 
               coat?

     Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move.  She 
     quickly sizes up the situation.  She tries to appear 
     matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.

                               CHRISTY
               No... it's fine. 

                               VINCE
               Yes?

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  A lot.

                               VINCE
               Is that why you came up here, Christy? 
               To thank me?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.

                               VINCE
               And to say you're sorry.  About this 
               afternoon.  And the things you said. 
               Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you 
               understand?  Forgotten.

                               CHRISTY
                             (catching the subtext)
               Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.

     Page 13.

     Vince crosses the room, to Christy.  He takes her hands in 
     his, and kisses them.

                               VINCE
               That's my girl.  My girl in mink.  Will 
               you be home?  Soon?

     Christy kisses Vince, quickly.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  I'll be... at the apartment.  
               Call me.  Thanks.  Again.

     Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the 
     door.  She fumbles a bit.  She finds the door.

                               CHRISTY
               Mink.  Wow.

     Christy walks backwards, out the door.  She turns; she is 
     gone.

                               JOEY
               Vince -- is she... okay?

                               VINCE
               Maybe.
                             (considering this)

                               WILLY
               I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind 
               of upset.

                               VINCE
               She did.
                             (making a decision)
               Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.

                               JOEY 
               And if she runs? 

                               VINCE
                             (icy)
               Take care of it.

     With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA

     Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from 
     Vince's office.  She passes through a glass door which 
     leads to the cubicle area.

     LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened 
     maze.  Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the 
     cubicle area.

                               JOEY
               Christy?  He only wants to talk to you!

     Page 14.

     ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall.  She is 
     clutching the coat.

                               WILLY
               Christy?

     There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to 
     the wall near Christy, with suction cups.  Christy tries to 
     pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly.

                               JOEY
               Christy?

     Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall.  She 
     hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end 
     of the room.

     ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat.

     Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat 
     explodes.

                               JOEY
               Come on, Christy!  There's no place to 
               go!

     Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine.  She 
     accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and 
     starts HUMMING.

     ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine.  He quickly 
     moves toward the SOUND.

     Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted.  He 
     starts moving quickly down the aisle   A chair, the kind on 
     casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; 
     the chair hits Willy and he falls.

     Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, 
     struggling to get up.  As Christy sprints away, Willy 
     SHOOTS at her.  He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS.

     Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been 
     summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to 
     close. She runs even faster.  A BULLET whistles past her 
     ear and hits the back wall of the elevator.  She reaches 
     for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone.

     Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs 
     into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the 
     door.

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, 
     still clutching the mink.  The thugs are gaining on her.  A 
     BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and 
     steps.

     Page 15.

     At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into 
     a corridor.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past 
     doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink.  Joey 
     appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a 
     supply room.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM

     Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a 
     pile of dirty linen.  Joey opens the door just as Christy 
     dives head first into the laundry chute.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like 
     a subway train through a tunnel.

     INT. BASEMENT

     The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin 
     of dirty linen.  Two workers glance around as they load 
     large washing machines with laundry.  Christy climbs out of 
     the bin and dashes for a door.  Working in a hotel, the 
     workers have seen everything.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Joey flies through the chute.

     INT. BASEMENT

     Joey suddenly flies into the bin.  He climbs out with his 
     gun in sight.

                               JOEY
               Which way?

     The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the 
     room.  One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street.  He 
     looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have 
     swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie's office is a glassed-in area set in the middle of 
     the station's main floor.

     Christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by Eddie and two 
     other detectives, CLARKSON and TATE.

                               CHRISTY
               Right between the eyes!  Down and out! 
               The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't 
               believe it!

                               EDDIE
               You couldn't believe it?  Vince the 
               Prince?

                               CHRISTY
               I never said he was an altar boy, okay?  
               But he sent his goons after me!  They 
               tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!

                               CLARKSON
               Tough break.  Whoa.

                               EDDIE
               What did you expect?  Vince is as dirty 
               as they come.  We've been finding bodies 
               around here for years.

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know anything about bodies!  I 
               mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was 
               good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. 
               He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to 
               go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let 
               me sing.

                               EDDIE
               He didn't do you a favor.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw you!

                               TATE
               Come on, she'll sing great.  When she 
               sings for us.

                               CHRISTY
               Sing -- like testify?  Are you nuts?  I 
               just want you to protect me!  You're 
               cops!

                               TATE
               Busy cops.  We don't have time to be 
               bodyguards for anyone who comes in here 
               with some cockamamie story.  Mink coats 
               and laundry chutes.

                               CLARKSON
               Unless, of course, you're willing to 
               testify.

     Page 17.

                               CHRISTY
               What is this, some squeeze play?  Can't 
               you just protect me without any strings?

     The three detectives move in closer now and really apply 
     the pressure.

                               EDDIE
               We could put you into our witness 
               protection program.

                               TATE
               A hiding place. 

                               CLARKSON
               A new identity.

                               EDDIE
               But you'd have to agree to testify.  The 
               whole nine yards.

                               CHRISTY
               And if I don't?

                               EDDIE
               Then-you run.

                               TATE
               You wait.

                               CLARKSON
               You listen for the footsteps.

                               EDDIE
               Then one day they find you.

                               TATE
               They open a window.

                               CLARKSON
               It's ten flights up.

                               TATE
               Ten flights down.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten flights?

                               EDDIE
               You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the 
               sidewalk.  And into the street.

                               CHRISTY
               All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do 
               it!  I'll testify!

                               EDDIE
                             (to Tate) 
               Get a stenographer.

     Page 18.

     Tate leaves.  Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, here's what I want.  I know about 
               this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With 
               room service.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Hawaii.

                               CLARKSON
               Diamond Head.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah.  And I'll need a new look.  Like a 
               disguise.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Armani.

                               CLARKSON
               No -- Calvin Klein.

                               CHRISTY
               For sportswear.  And a limo.  And my 
               hair -- up?

                               CLARKSON
               It could work.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus, what do you think this is --
               Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out 
               for you.  You have to hide like you don't 
               even exist.  You have to get so far 
               hidden away that you never see sunlight.

                               CHRISTY
                             (confused)
               Okay -- no limo.

                               EDDIE
               No nothing.

                               CHRISTY
               What're you gonna do, put me in a bag 
               and bury me?

                               EDDIE
               I'm gonna put you in the last place on 
               Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

     Eddie smiles.  Christy doesn't like the sound of this at 
     all a

     INT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY

     Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, 
     blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- 
     badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.

     PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel 
     at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent.  The organ isn't 
     getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER 
     ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing 
     aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because 
     Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's 
     playing.

     As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she 
     closes the door behind her.  Across the lobby, the front 
     door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Eddie)
               I hate you.  I totally hate you.

                               EDDIE
               Safest place in the world.  You think 
               Vince would look for you here?

     As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious 
     artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. 
     ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of 
     hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait 
     of St. Katherine.  Christy shudders.

                               CHRISTY
               Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. 
               Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.

                               EDDIE
               It's a convent.  All you have to do is 
               shut up, behave yourself, and get along.

                               CHRISTY
               With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm 
               gonna go back, work things out with 
               Vince.

     Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie 
     catches her arm.

                               EDDIE
               Vince has put out a contract on you.  A 
               hundred grand.  You've seen him in 
               action.

     Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's 
     telling the truth.

                               CHRISTY
               But... but Vince loves me.  How could 
               he... I mean, five years...

     Page 20.

                               EDDIE
               And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna 
               take.

                               CHRISTY
                             (suddenly scared)
               But Vince has contacts all over the 
               place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll 
               be looking for me!

                               EDDIE
               Everywhere but this little hole-in-the-
               wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here 
               but me.  We're trying to get a quick 
               court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. 
               I'll spring you as soon as I can.

                               CHRISTY
                             (panicking)
               I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! 
               Eddie, what am I gonna do?

                               EDDIE
               Pray.
                             (smiling)

     From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn --
     horribly.  The voices don't blend, and individual notes are 
     real migraine material.  Christy looks aghast.  Eddie urges 
     her into a corridor, and she follows.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     The office is bare and austere.  MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at 
     her desk with her hands folded.  Like all the nuns at the 
     convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and 
     wimple.

     Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, 
     and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as 
     she rules.  Control is her passion; within the walls of the 
     convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's 
     a world she controls.

               But Mother Superior is not in control at 
               this particular moment.  BISHOP GEORGE 
               O'HARA stands before her with a majestic 
               presence and some bad news.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but 
               no.

                               O'HARA
               We can save this young woman's life, and 
               imprison a parasite -- all in one 
               gesture.

     Page 21.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But she's been exposed to the underside 
               of life.  She is the underside of life.

                               O'HARA
               And therefore an ideal prospect for 
               rehabilitation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely 
               there are... more appropriate shelters.

                               O'HARA
               Your small convent is in danger of 
               closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas 
               Police Department has offered to make a 
               generous financial donation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But, Bishop...

                               O'HARA
               St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. 
               You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To 
               all in need.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I lied.

                               O'HARA
               I know.
                             (smiling)

     Mother Superior's jaw locks.  She realizes she is stuck 
     with the situation and will have to control it as best she 
     can.  There is a KNOCK at the door, and Eddie and Christy 
     enter.

                               O'HARA
               Welcome, Lieutenant.  Everything is in 
               order.

                               EDDIE
               Aces.  Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, 
               down at the corner?

     The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior 
     panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's 
     office.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, you're not leaving me alone...

                               O'HARA
                             (reassuringly)
               You're never alone in this house, my 
               child.

     Eddie touches her gently on the arm.

     Page 22.

                               EDDIE
               One month, two tops.  Behave yourself.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Bishop...
                             (a last-ditch attempt)

                               O'HARA
                             (opening the door to 
                             leave)
               Lieutenant?

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CONVENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER

     Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's 
     front door.  As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing 
     horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation.

                               CHRISTY
               A convent?  They put me in a convent? 
               What's the problem?  Wasn't there any 
               more room in Hell?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very calm)
               What is your full name?  Your Christian 
               name?

                               CHRISTY
               Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you 
               understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm 
               the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm 
               being punished!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your name?

                               CHRISTY
               Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Enough joking.

                               CHRISTY
               That's my real name!  Currently I'm a  
               singer.  Sort of.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Very well.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell 
               me this isn't happening.  It's a 
               nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               St. Anne's?

                               CHRISTY
               Parochial school.  Akron.  St. 
               Android's.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You were unhappy?

                               CHRISTY
               I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The reason?

                               CHRISTY
               Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! 
               Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy 
               petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing 
               a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon 
               bra.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I see.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  You see?  I have to get out of 
               here   I have to make a phone call.  
               Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent!  
               You're a nun!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very stern)
               Sit down.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mother Superior rises.  She is an extremely imposing 
     woman. 

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sit.

     Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother 
     Superior.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Miss Van Cartier. 

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (belligerent)

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cigarette -- out.

     Christy inspects her cigarette.

     Page 24.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (ruefully)
               It has come to pass.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I joined this convent some thirty years 
               ago.  At that time, the world knew some 
               measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order 
               was a beacon of hospitality, to families, 
               to children, to a neighborhood filled 
               with promise.  And, as the years have 
               passed, I have watched that promise 
               destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.
                             (staring at Christy's 
                             outfit) Spandex.  And. 
                             so I have made this 
                             convent an oasis, a 
                             retreat from horror. 
                             And now that horror has 
                             invaded these sacred 
                             walls.

                               CHRISTY
               Are you talking about me?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And all those like you.

                               CHRISTY
               You mean black people?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The 
               heedless.  And their Las Vegas 
               concubines.

                               CHRISTY
                             (very suspicious) 
                             What's a concubine?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Check your driver's license.

     Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, 
               I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here 
               or I'm target practice.  So here's the 
               deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug 
               me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch 
               some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just 
               get me a key and show me to my room, and 
               do not disturb.  Capisce?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (suspiciously 
                             gracious)
               Of course.  But it's almost lunch.

     Page 25.

                               CHRISTY
               Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Before we do, you might like to freshen 
               up.  And you'll certainly want to change

                               CHRISTY
                             (sniffing her clothes, 
                             the same outfit she's 
                             had on since the night 
                             at Vince's office)
               Deal.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     A small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, 
     and several wooden cabinets.  There is a wooden screen in a 
     corner, marking a changing area.  Christy is behind the 
     screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  Mother Superior 
     stands beside the screen, catching the various items of 
     clothing which Christy tosses to her.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               How about a robe?  One of those big 
               terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on 
               the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Would you like that?

     Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and 
     tosses them down a chute marked "INCINERATOR."

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               You should hand-wash that blouse, and 
               send somebody out for some things.  I 
               look good in reds, purples, hot pink --
               and shoes.  Five-inch heels.  Fuck-me 
               pumps.  Oh, man -- sorry.   'Scuse my 
               mouth.

     Mother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a 
     ruler; it goes down the incinerator.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. 
               You will find appropriate attire.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               Can do.

     INT. CHAPEL

     A group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed.  They hear 
     a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look 
     up, puzzled.

     Page 26.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring 
     at herself, in complete shock.  She now wears a habit and 
     wimple.  Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the 
     wimple.

                               CHRISTY
                             (almost unable to 
                             speak)
               No!  No!  I can't do this!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, 
               and you endanger us all.  While you are 
               here, you will conduct yourself as a nun.  
               Only I shall know who, and what, you 
               truly are.  You will not disrupt the 
               convent.  You will not influence the 
               Sisters with your colorful street talk. 
               You will draw no attention to yourself in 
               any way.

                               CHRISTY
                             (furious, in 
                             disbelief)
               But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a 
               nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As of now, and until you leave, you are 
               Sister Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
                             (outraged)
               Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb 
               guy?

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall.  Christy is 
     beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The Mary is in deference to the Holy 
               Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint 
               Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows 
               that every nun must accept.  The vow of 
               poverty...

                               CHRISTY
                             (pulling out her 
                             pockets)
               No problem.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The vow of obedience.

                               CHRISTY
               Like to who?

     Page 27.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And the vow of chastity.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm outta here.

     Christy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the 
     wimple

     INT. CONVENT DINING HALL

     A large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a 
     crude iron chandelier.  There is a long, central wooden 
     table, with rough wooden benches.

     The convent's population is standing around the table in 
     silence.  There are about thirty nuns in all.

     Mother Superior moves to the head of the table, with 
     Christy following her.  She motions for Christy to stand at 
     her right.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good afternoon, Sisters.  I apologize 
               for my tardiness.  I would like you to 
               welcome a new member of our order, Sister 
               Mary Clarence.

     ANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside 
     Christy.  Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but 
     very sweet.  She has only been at the convent a few years; 
     she wears the simpler habit of a novice.  She sneaks a look 
     at Christy.  Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring 
     at her hands.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence comes to us from a 
               somewhat more progressive convent.  She 
               is eager for a more disciplined life, and 
               will make every effort to conform to our 
               ways.

     Everyone sits, including Christy.  SISTER MARY PATRICK, a 
     nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary 
     Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes, Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Reverend Mother, on behalf of the 
               sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary 
               Clarence to St. Katherine's.

     ANGLE on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted. 

     Page 28.

                               MARY PATRICK
               As part of our welcome, I've had a 
               little thought, just for fun.  Could we 
               have our new friend offer today's 
               blessing?

     ANGLE on the nuns, watching Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (reluctantly)
               Very well.  Mary Clarence, rise please.

     Christy stands up slowly, aghast.

                               CHRISTY
               A blessing?  Like, for lunch?

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, beaming.  She and the other nuns 
     bow their heads.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to recall a 
                             blessing)
               For what we are about to receive...

     So far, so good.  Mother Superior has one eye open.

                               CHRISTY
               may the Lord... prepare us and... watch 
               us and... walk through the valley and be 
               our shepherd and... to the republic for 
               which it stands... God bless us every 
               one, hallowed be thy name.  Hallelujah.  
               Ave Maria. Boyardee.  Amen.

     ANGLE on the nuns, staring at Christy. Mother Superior 
     rises, very quickly.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sisters, for the rest of the day we 
               shall declare a Vow of Silence.

                               CHRISTY
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Surely you are familiar with this 
               practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our 
               lips are silent, can our prayers truly be 
               heard.

                               CHRISTY
               Silence?  No talking?  All day?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Until sundown.

     Page 29.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words. 
                             without speaking aloud)
               Oh my God.

     Christy reaches for a piece of bread.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And Mary Clarence?

     Christy looks up.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As a new member of our order, I think 
               you might also enjoy a ritual fast.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words)
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of 
               those who must endure without enough to 
               eat.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing)
               No food?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (taking away Christy's 
                             plate)
               No food.  Not until sundown.

     ANGLE on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching 
     the other nuns eat.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey 
     and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney.  Vince is 
     steaming as they walk through the parking lot.

               They grilled me for six hours in there. 
               And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell 
               were you?

                               LARRY
               It takes time, Vince.  Slow and steady. 
               We've been through this before.

     Vince reaches his car.  As Joey opens the door for him, 
     another car drives by, and stops.  Eddie is driving; he 
     leans out the window.

                               EDDIE
               So long, Vince.  See you soon.

     Page 30.

     Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him.  Eddie 
     drives off, chuckling.

                               VINCE
               He's so damn cocky.  This is different.

                               JOEY
               It's a bluff, Vince.

                               VINCE
               You know so much.  They've got Christy, 
               and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, 
               from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to 
               every contact we got.

     Larry covers his ears with both hands.

                               LARRY
               I can't hear this.  I'm an attorney, 
               Vince, and you're just an honest casino 
               owner.  Object of a witch hunt. Innocent 
               victim.

                               VINCE
               Keep the message vague, but let 'em 
               know.  The price has gone up.  Christy 
               Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million.  
               Dead or nearby.

     Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.

     EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY

     The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a 
     patch of land surrounded by high walls.  Various sections 
     have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.

     Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. 
     They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.

     Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  She is 
     hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  She picks up 
     a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see 
     if anyone is watching.  She starts to gnaw on the carrot.  
     She becomes aware that someone is watching her.  She looks 
     up.

     Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, 
     breaking her fast.  Christy drops the carrot on the ground, 
     as if it burned her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the 
     next furrow over.

     Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes.  
     Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their 
     tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister 
     Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it 
     at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger 
     at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing.

     Page 31.

     Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes 
     nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of 
     the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.

     Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn 
     and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles 
     her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.

     Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees 
     Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother 
     Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.

     EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT

     LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of 
     Silence.

     We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S.

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

     This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors 
     with tiny, grilled windows.  These are the cells where the 
     nuns sleep.  Nuns are entering their cells and closing 
     their doors for the night.

     Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, 
     bedraggled Christy.  Christy is devouring a slice of brown 
     bread.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this all the food I get?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes.  Until breakfast.

                               CHRISTY
               That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any 
               snacks?  Machines?

     They stop by a door.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
               My what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cell.  Your room.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy 
     enter.  The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  There 
     is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered 
     mattress.  There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.

     Page 32.

                               CHRISTY
                             (looking around)
               You were right the first time.  Is this 
               like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the 
               furniture?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Our lives are simple.  We have little 
               need for material possessions.

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure thing.  But what about, 
               like, appliances?  Like a little color 
               portable?  Boom box?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Useless distractions.

                               CHRISTY
                             (sinking to the bed)
               It's like the Stone Age.  The room time 
               forgot.  What about a phone?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And whom would you call?

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, I don't know... Satan?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused) 
               Your cell is more than adequate.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping-
               Pong?  Row over to the monastery?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.

                               CHRISTY
               Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? 
               At nine?  My day's just starting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use 
               this time, to think about my life.  And 
               its direction.  Or lack thereof.

                               CHRISTY
                             (indignant)
               What's wrong with my life?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               From all I've heard, just about 
               everything.  Your singing career seems 
               all but nonexistent, and your married 
               lover wants you dead.

     Page 33

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               If you're fooling anyone, it's only 
               yourself.  God has brought you here. Take 
               the hint.

     Mother Superior leaves.

     After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one 
     small window in her cell.  She leans her head against the 
     wall.  She is trying not to think about what Mother 
     Superior has said.  Still, the mess her life has become 
     overwhelms her.  She fights back tears.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The sun is just barely rising, as the convent BELL tolls.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     Christy is fast asleep.  There is a RAPPING at the door.

                               MARY ROBERT (0.S.)
               Sister Mary Clarence!

     EXT. CONVENT HALLWAY

     All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and 
     nightshirts, down the hallway.

     Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and 
     her hair is a mess.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Come on, we're late.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What time is it?

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's after five.  We have to bathe.

                               CHRISTY
                             (groaning)
               Five a.m.?

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Christy is standing on line in the hall, along with 
     several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers.  They 
     carry soap and towels.

     Page 34.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (sincerely)
               Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good 
               morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Is this like your old convent?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Which convent was that, Sister?

                               CHRISTY
               Which convent?  It was, um, the Little 
               Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. 
               Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. 
               Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside. 

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Enough jabber.

     MARY LAZARUS is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense, 
     a hard-liner.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It 
               sounds awful.  It sounds just like this 
               place.

                               CHRISTY
               Like this place?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out 
               in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like 
               here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare 
               feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on 
               earth, but I loved it.  This place is a 
               Hilton.

     INT. BATHING ROOM

     A stone room that is very medieval-looking.  One wall is 
     divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  In each stall is 
     a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a 
     thin stream of lukewarm water.  We see only the nuns' heads 
     and shoulders.

     Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, 
     her eyes closed.  Lost in thought, she begins singing 
     softly to herself.

     Page 35.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE

                               A FEW OTHER NUNS
                             (very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

     Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around.  The 
     other nuns are bathing, their eyes down.  There is no sign 
     of singing.  Christy decides to try a test.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
                             (still very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

                               CHRISTY
               IF I WERE YOU,
               I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK

     The nuns giggle.

                               CHRISTY
               Where did that come from?

                               MARY PATRICK
               I haven't heard that song in ages.  The 
               Ronettes?

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (very grouchy)
               Shirelles.

                               CHRISTY
               You know that song?

                               MARY PATRICK
               1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when 
               many of us took final vows.  It's the 
               last secular music we recall.

                               CHRISTY
               No.
               HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING
               NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING

                               ALL THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY LA

     Page 36.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (cutting off the song)
               That's enough.  We've got to get to 
               chapel.

     Mary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns 
     resume scrubbing themselves.  Christy looks around.

                               CHRISTY
               Anybody got conditioner?

     INT. CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass.  He stands in 
     the pulpit.  The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to 
     his left.  The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother 
     Superior, sit in the first few pews.

                               O'HARA
               We are a small congregation this 
               morning.  Too many mornings.  Something 
               has gone terribly wrong.   Where is 
               faith?  Where is celebration?  Where is 
               everyone?  Still, rather than regret the 
               absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice 
               in the fellowship of those present.  Our 
               choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has 
               informed me that our choir, while always 
               superior, has been toiling especially 
               hard on this week's selection.  Sister?

     Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins 
     singing. They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be 
     Guided." As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no 
     tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.

     As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. 
     Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly 
     people are in attendance.

     ANGLE ON CHRISTY

     sitting with the other nuns.  She is clearly about to fall 
     asleep.  Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous 
     note, and Christy jerks awake.  She immediately tries to 
     assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her 
     hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday 
     School calendar.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT

     Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into 
     the police station.

     INT. POLICE STATION

     Clarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled 
     office.  Along the way, he signals Detective Tate to follow 
     him.

     Page 37.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter.

                               CLARKSON
               There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. 
               this morning.  The place was fencing 
               stolen property.  They found this.

     Clarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity 
     photograph of Christy.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a

                             sheet) 
               Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two 
               hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
               Please find our adored angel, we miss her 
               so.  Dead or alive.

                               TATE
               Vince is getting desperate.  Where is 
               she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?

                               EDDIE
               Where's who?

                               TATE
               You won't even tell us?

                               EDDIE
               I wouldn't even tell the Pope.

     INT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style 
     desks.  A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has 
     gathered.  The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and 
     clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad 
     Girls.  Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her 
     usual perky manner.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Good afternoon, young ladies.  And 
               welcome to our Christian Youth Group.

     The Girls make grunting noises.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Hi.  I hope we'll have some fun, and 
               maybe learn a little something, too. Now, 
               today's topic is something very up-to-
               date -- "Teenage Promiscuity."  My. Now, 
               can anyone tell me -- just what is 
               promiscuity?

     ANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their 
     eyes.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Anyone?  Yes?

     Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier 
     and a leather baseball cap.  Her name is Lawanda.

                               LAWANDA
               Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it.  A 
               whole lot.  Till your head falls off.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (blushing)
               Well, yes.  That is one way to put it.

     Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by 
     Christy

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sister Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Yes?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I need to see you, at once.  Girls, 
               please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a 
               few moments.  Mary Clarence?

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. 
               She'll be minding you until Sister Mary 
               Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please 
               assign a biblical passage.  Do not 
               attempt discussion.  Am I understood?

                               CHRISTY
               I got it.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (to Mary Patrick)
               Come, Sister.

     Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom. 
     Christy now stands at the front of the room.  She is 
     visibly uncomfortable.

                               CHRISTY
               So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary 
               Clarence.  And you're... young 
               Christians.  I guess I should assign you 
               this passage.  What's good?  What were 
               you talking about?

                               LAWANDA
               We were talking about the wild thing. 
               Teen promiscuity.

     Page 39

                               CHRISTY
                             (after a beat)
               Really.

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing 
               it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to behave)
               Well... yes.  Yes it is.

                               LAWANDA
                             (goading Christy)
               How come?  Sister?

                               CHRISTY
                             (still trying to 
                             behave)
               Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou 
               shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.

     The Girls all laugh and make jeering noises.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me -- just what are you all doing 
               here?  At Sunday School?

                               LAWANDA
               'Cause we love it so damn much.  And 
               cause we gotta come here.  Probation.

                               CHRISTY
               Probation?

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. 
               Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch 
               with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So 
               we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll 
               learn valuable lessons.  And I learned 
               mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will 
               never rip out nobody's nose-ring by 
               accident ever again.  Can I go now?

                               CHRISTY
                             (getting fed up)
               Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can 
               tell.

                               LAWANDA
               Well, what would you know about it, 
               anyway?  What do any of you nunheads know 
               about anything?  About doin' the nasty, 
               or gettin' high?

                               CONCHITA
               Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just 
               some ol' nun!  Don't pick on no nun, it's 
               bad luck!

     Page 40.

                               CHRISTY
                             (fed up)
               Shut up!

     All the Girls look up, stunned by Christy's language.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want 
               to ask me something?  You want to listen, 
               for once in your little lives? You want 
               to pay some attention?

                               CHARLENE
               What about crack?  You a user?

                               CHRISTY
               I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

     All the girls jeer at Charlene.

                               KESHIA
               Got you, Charlene!

                               CONCHITA
               Dunked by the nun!

                               LAWANDA
                             (more sincerely)
               Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if 
               some dude is after you, and he's always 
               saying stuff, commin' on sweet and 
               mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll 
               love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, 
               you'd stay.

                               CHRISTY
               And you listen to that?

                               LAWANDA
               No, but... I don't know... sometimes.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I 
               do.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               What you do?

                               CHRISTY
               Just tell him, I do love you, but I 
               can't -- I'm a nun.

     The girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like 
     Christy.

     Page 41.

                               CHARLENE
               But, like what if you are doin' it? What 
               about protection?  Who's responsible?

                               CONCHITA
               What about them things, you know, for 
               the guy?  Aren't they like, a mess to put 
               on?  Don't they kinda mess up the mood?

                               CHRISTY
               Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's 
               important, nowadays.  You just practice 
               at home, with a balloon and a banana.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (0.S.)
               Mary Clarence!

     Mother Superior has returned, with Mary Patrick.  Everyone 
     has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has 
     noticed their entrance.

                               CHRISTY
                             (thinking on her feet)
               Because a banana is part of a balanced 
               breakfast.  And don't forget fiber.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

     Mother Superior is seated behind her desk; she is very 
     angry.  Christy sits across from her.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary 
               Clarence, what were you thinking?

                               CHRISTY
               Those girls were asking questions.  
               They've got it rough.  I wish somebody 
               had talked to me about that stuff when 
               was their age.  I wish somebody would 
               talk to me about it now.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This is a convent, not a clinic.  We 
               offer moral guidance, not hardware.

                               CHRISTY
               Have you been out in those streets?  Do 
               you know what those kids are up against?  
               You should help them!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We are nuns.  We seek solutions through 
               prayer.

     Page 42.

                               CHRISTY
               Sometimes it's not enough!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone 
               cannot help a situation.  Such as your 
               own, for example.  How do you feel about 
               physical labor?

                               CHRISTY
               It never solves anything.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, 
               in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a 
               wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy 
               task, and know ye the path of 
               contentment."

                               CHRISTY
               In English?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary 
               Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."

     Mother Superior smiles in a rather evil manner.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight 
     Hotel and Casino.  He clearly has a new mistress or two.

                               VINCE
                             (very seductive)
               Baby, you know I do... of course... I 
               feel it too... I'm blushing... can you 
               hold?

     A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it.  Vince 
     meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved 
     in a second romantic call.

                               VINCE
               Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... 
               how lonely?

                               WILLY
               It's that call you were expecting, 
               Vince.

                               VINCE
               Can you hold?  Can you try?

     Willy passes the phone to Vince. t

     Page 43

                               VINCE
               Have you found out where Christy is yet?  
               Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want 
               to try making it on a cop's salary?  Find 
               her, and find her now!

     Vince passes the phone back to Willy.

                               VINCE
               Raise the ante to three hundred grand.

     Willy heads for the fax machine.  Vince regains his 
     composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button.

                               VINCE
               Sorry, baby... you are?  Totally?  Not a 
               stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... 
               inside...

     INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM

     This is a large, open room where the nuns create various 
     gift items which the convent sells to support itself.  
     Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting 
     Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments.

     On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing 
     loom, which resembles a grand piano.  The loom is wooden; a 
     tapestry is half-completed.  Mary Patrick is seated at the 
     loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  Christy stands 
     beside her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               The minute I saw you. I said to myself, 
               she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a 
               loom?

                               CHRISTY
               Not in years.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Well, it all comes back, in just a 
               jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of 
               the convent.

                               CHRISTY
               Why?

                               MARY PATRICK
               To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, 
               but we're in terrible trouble here at St. 
               Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the 
               furnace is going, and there's no money.

                               CHRISTY
               But don't you get money?  From the 
               Vatican?

     Page 44.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely 
               self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like 
               yours.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, right.  At my old place, we used 
               to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice 
               loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, 
               and then you can hop right in.
                             (as she deftly works 
                             the loom)
               You just draw your beater in, keep it 
               pressed against the pick, and open the 
               shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and 
               open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, 
               shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the 
               warp.  Is that clear?

                               CHRISTY
                             (pretending to be 
                             fascinated)
               Just about.  Show me again.

                               MARY PATRICK
               You betcha.

     CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed 
     considerably.

     ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing 
     through a magazine.

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your 
               heddles.

                               CHRISTY
               I love my heddles.  Show me again.

     Mother Superior appears.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving 
               progressing?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend 
               Mother -

     Page 45.

                               CHRISTY
               Really catching on.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the 
               office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.

     Mother Superior gestures to the loom.  Christy sits at the 
     loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit.

     Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her 
     face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's 
     instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were 
     about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, 
     at random.  She moves these parts.

     ANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy's movements, 
     the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, 
     the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus 
     disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and 
     falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. 
     Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Months of work, and the loom, absolutely 
               ruined!

                               CHRISTY
               Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I 
               wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, 
               or knit little sweaters! I don't do that!  
               I'm a star!

     Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and 
     stares at Christy.  Then she smiles, in a rather 
     frightening manner.

     MONTAGE - CHRISTY

     A)on her hands and knees. scrubbing the stone floor of a 
     convent hallway.

     B)crawling along between the pews in the chapel, oiling 
     every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag.

     C)crawling along the convent roof, cleaning out gutters 
     with a trowel.  She discovers a dead rat in one of the 
     gutters.

     Page 46

     D)sewing; she is repairing a hole in a habit.  The CAMERA 
     PULLS BACK.  Christy is sitting in a small stone room, 
     surrounded by piles of torn habits, linen and other 
     mending.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is on the phone in the darkened office.  She keeps 
     checking the door, to make sure no one is listening.

                               CHRISTY
                             (into phone)
               Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy.  
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Mulcahy.

     Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly 
     and frantically.  INTERCUT between Christy and Eddie.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.

                               EDDIE
               Not again.  You can't keep calling. 
               Somebody's going to catch on to where you 
               are.

                               CHRISTY
               But I'm going insane!  All these people 
               do is pray and work, work and pray!  I 
               don't get it -- when's the weekend? They 
               have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call 
               food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns!  
               I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray 
               five times a days  Do you know what I 
               pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea?  
               Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall 
               off yet?  Get me outta her!

                               EDDIE
               Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell 
               you this, but we've had some problems 
               with our protection program lately.

                               CHRISTY
               Like what?

                               EDDIE
               Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide 
               them, but there's a leak in the 
               department, and they end up dead.

                               CHRISTY
               You son-of-a-bitch!

     Page 47

                               EDDIE
               I just need a few more weeks,

                               CHRISTY
               But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior 
               is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She 
               keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!

     In the distance, Christy hears the CHOIR practicing; they 
     sound even worse than usual.

                               CHRISTY
                             (holding the phone 
                             out)
               Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, 
               in here, that's what they call music!

                               EDDIE
               Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll 
               be in touch.

     As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters.  Christy 
     takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She 
     sings as she works.

                               CHRISTY
               THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF 
               MUSIC...

     Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room.  Mother 
     Superior looks mystified.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL - MIDNIGHT

     Christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, 
     utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor.  There is a 
     meek SCRATCHING at her door.

                               CHRISTY
                             (without moving)
               Yeah?

     Sister Mary Robert enters, very shyly.  She barely looks 
     up.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What does she want now?  I did 
               the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted 
               the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why 
               can't people share?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (not speaking above a 
                             whisper)
               I... I...

     Page 48.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY ROBERT
               I... I brought you something.

                               CHRISTY
               A cigarette?

                               MARY ROBERT
               An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, 
               you need your strength.  You've been 
               working so hard.

     Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown 
     bread.  Christy takes it..

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister 
               Bruce?  Sister Doug?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (until almost 
                             whispering)
               Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.

     Mary Robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands.  She 
     doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied. Christy is at a 
     loss.

                               CHRISTY
               So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. 
               K's?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Three years.  Sister.

                               CHRISTY
               Three years.  A rookie.

                               MARY ROBERT
               A novice.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? 
               When do you hit the big time?  You know, 
               when do you take the final vows?

     Mary Robert bursts into tears.

                               CHRISTY
               Whoa!  Bob!  What's going on here? 
               What'd I say?

     Page 49.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (still sobbing)
               You have to help me

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are 
               they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they 
               drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, 
               kidnap your parents?  We can call the 
               Enquirer.

                               MARY ROBERT
               No, you don't understand -- I don't want 
               to get out!  I want to get in?

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I 
               want to take my final vows, I would do it 
               tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let 
               me!

                               CHRISTY
               She won't?  Why not?

                               MARY ROBERT
               She says I should wait.  She says that 
               no one should become a nun as an escape 
               from life.  She says that I'm not 
               experienced enough to make the decision 
               yet.  In a mature manner.

                               CHRISTY
               She said that?  Reverend Mother?

     Mary Robert nods, solemnly.  Suddenly, from the streets 
     outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, 
     and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, then there's only one thing to do.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Reverend Mother says you need 
               experience, right, in life.  In order to 
               make a responsible decision.  This is 
               going to be very painful for me.  You 
               know how much I love this little room. 
               This whole convent.  Wait.

     Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the 
     wall.  She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus 
     is advising her.

     Page 50.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               Must I do this thing, 0 Lord?  Please 
               help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my 
               selfish cares aside... I must think of 
               others... yes, she's here...
                             (she gestures to Mary 
                             Robert)
               He says hi... yes, I understand... let 
               thy will be done.  Amen.  You too.

     Christy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy 
     message.

                               CHRISTY
               We must do this sacred thing, Mary 
               Robert.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (desperate)
               Of course!  We must do it!  It's the 
               will of God!  What is it?

                               CHRISTY
                             (shutting her eyes, 
                             for the full spiritual 
                             effect)
               We must... get you some experience.  We 
               must... leave this place.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Are you sure?

     Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street.  Christy turns to 
     the crucifix.  She gets confirmation.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               We hear you.

     EXT. STREET

     The outer wall of the convent.  A door swings open, and 
     Christy sticks her head out.  She looks both ways, and 
     steps outside.  She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears 
     from behind her.  Mary Robert looks very wary.  Christy 
     pulls her along.

     EXT. A STREET NEARBY

     Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks 
     from the convent.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (looking around 
                             cautiously)
               Are you sure this is what Reverend 
               Mother had in mind?

     Page 51.

                               CHRISTY
               I know it is.  It's life.  Experience.  
               Take a deep breath.

     Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.  She 
     spins, letting her habit billow around her.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (shocked)
               Mary Clarence!

                               CHRISTY
               Now you.

     Mary Robert's eyes widen.  She points to herself -- "Me?" 
     Christy nods.  Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, 
     and does a little, timid hop.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a start.

     EXT. SOCIAL CLUB

     A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer 
     signs.  The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all 
     but explodes with good times.  A group of teenagers lounge 
     on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  Among the 
     teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth 
     group.  Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group 
     falls silent.

                               CHRISTY
               How are you doing.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?

                               CHRISTY
               You know it.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We need experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (remembering she's a 
                             nun)
               It's part of St. Katherine's new 
               community outreach program.  How old are 
               you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you 
               ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em 
               over.

     Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.  Christy 
     turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer.

     Page 52.

                               CHRISTY
               And you, with the devil's brew passing 
               through your lips.
                             (holding out her hand)
               A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

     The boy hands over the beer.  Christy and Mary Robert 
     enter the club.

     INT. SOCIAL CLUB

     Christy enters the club and grins.  She takes a drag on 
     the cigarette.  Mary Robert grabs the beer from Christy's 
     hand, and takes a swig.

                               CHRISTY
                             (shocked)
               Bobs

                               MARY ROBERT
               Experience!  Right?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

     The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, 
     couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor 
     is packed.  The atmosphere is a combination of hazy 
     darkness and colored lights; the club should have the 
     feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all 
     ages and races.  The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts 
     to move to it.  She and Mary Robert find a table in the 
     corner, and signal a nearby waitress.

                               CHRISTY
               A couple of bowls of chili.
                             (holding up the beer)
               And another round of these.

     The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club 
     has never hosted nuns before.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to the waitress, 
                             confidentially)
               I have to do this.  So I can become a 
               nun.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, 
               we make her wear her underwear on her 
               head.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Really?

     Page 53

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               And she wants to be a nun.

     The waitress leaves, shaking her head.  Christy and Mary 
     Robert watch the action at the club.

     Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns, 
     especially Christy; he tries to place her.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Who are all these people?

                               CHRISTY
               This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. 
               You should get to know 'em.

     From across the room, Mike the bartender continues to 
     study Christy's face.  He takes out a copy of Vince's fax 
     photo and stares at it.  He covers Christy's hair in the 
     photo with his hands, creating a wimple.  There is no 
     question in his mind; the two are the same.  Mike has a 
     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the 
     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.

     There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the 
     club.  They start playing a hot dance number, and the club 
     really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills.  Christy 
     and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the 
     music.

     A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns 
     table.  He is clearly amused at their presence.

                               DUDE
               Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'?

                               CHRISTY
                             (flirting)
               Better now.

                               DUDE
               How come they let you out?  Out of that 
               convent place?

                               CHRISTY
               Time off.  For bad behavior.

                               DUDE
               Oww!  A nun havin' fun!  I don't believe 
               it!  It's good to have you ladies in this 
               fine establishment.  So... anybody on the 
               move?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (standing up)
               I am.

     Page 54.

                               CHRISTY
               Bob!  What're you doing?

     Mary Robert leads the Dude out onto the dance floor.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I'm getting experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the Dude)
               You watch yourself!

     Christy decides she'd better keep an eye on Mary Robert; 
     she grabs another DUDE, and heads for the dance floor.

     As the music percolates, Christy and Mary Robert dance;  
     Christy is very hot, and Mary Robert picks up on her moves.  
     The CLUB PATRONS are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start 
     to get down.

                               CLUB PATRON #1
               Do it, Sisters!

                               CLUB PATRON #2
               Sway and pray!

     As the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the 
     Club Patrons cheer, shouting "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent. 
     They are both in very good spirits.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Those people are wonderful!  Why don't 
               we ever see them in church?

                               CHRISTY
               Good point.  Especially that dude you 
               were with.  I'd like to see him down 
               front.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (giggling)
               Mary Clarence!  You're so... different 
               from the other sisters.  Sometimes, 
               well... sometimes you sound more like a 
               layperson.

                               CHRISTY
               Honey.

     As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car 
     that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with 
     its headlights out.

     Page 55.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother 
               about all my experiences.  I've learned 
               so much.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, you know, you don't have to tell 
               her everything.  I mean, nothing really 
               happened.  We just... took a walk.

     The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns 
     turn, startled.  The car hurtles toward them.  They scream, 
     and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the 
     car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.

     Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into 
     reverse, and then pull forward again.  She sees a glint of 
     light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the 
     bartender) leans out the window.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Mary Robert)
               Run!

     Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.  As she does 
     so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.  The shot misses the 
     two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store 
     behind them.

     EXT. ALLEY

     Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's 
     FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence! 

                               CHRISTY
               Keep moving!

     Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary 
     Robert up the ladder ahead of her.

                               CHRISTY
               Climb!  Now!

     As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another 
     GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire 
     escape.

     The nuns climb higher up the building.  Mike pursues, 
     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but 
     not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time 
     and begins to gain ground.

     At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in 
     the grating.  She pulls frantically at the laces.

     Page 56.

                               CHRISTY
               Goddamn it!

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence!

     Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her 
     toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for 
     the gun.  Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal 
     frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING 
     down the metal steps to the landing below.  Christy shoves 
     Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and 
     follows her in.

     INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT

     Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an 
     Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in 
     bed.  At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned 
     to see two nuns in their bedroom.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my Lord!

                               CHRISTY
                             (pushing Mary Robert 
                             forward)
               Experience!

     The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out 
     of the room.

     EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the 
     convent; they catch their breath.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What was all that?  Who was that man?  
               Why would he shoot at us?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know, some people just don't 
               like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We could have been killed!  But you 
               saved me!
                             (throwing her arms 
                             around Christy)
               Thank you, Mary Clarence!

     The door to the convent swings open.  Mother Superior is 
     waiting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes -- thank you so much.

     Page 57

     INT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY

     Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, 
     listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She 
     seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the 
     principal's office.

     The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office.

                               CHRISTY
               What'd she say?

                               EDDIE
               You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't 
               want you back.

                               CHRISTY
               Does she know people are trying to kill 
               me out there?

                               EDDIE
               She's counting on it.  She's concerned 
               for your safety, but she wants me to try 
               and find another convent that will take 
               you. Or a carnival.

                               CHRISTY
               So what am I supposed to do in the 
               meantime?

                               EDDIE
               Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt. 
                             (urging her)
               Go.

     Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.  She 
     looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in.  She finally 
     does.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Mother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as 
     Christy enters.  Christy is trying to figure out a 
     strategy.

                               CHRISTY
               So... hi there.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused and not 
                             looking up)
               I don't believe we have anything to say 
               to each other.

                               CHRISTY
               Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm 
               incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I 
               wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would 
               happen!

     Page 58.

     Mother Superior glances up from her work.  She is 
     justifiably outraged.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your 
               behavior was inexcusable!

                               CHRISTY
               I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for 
               it to happen!  And I was the one they 
               were shooting at!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, I have given you every 
               opportunity.  To change.  To make a 
               decent life for yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A 
               janitor?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Clearly, you have learned nothing. And 
               you present an ongoing threat, both to 
               this convent and to yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to 
               kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! 
               Aren't you supposed to have compassion? 
               For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a 
               major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of 
               Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come 
               true?  Your Olympic event?

     Mother Superior stares at Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.

                               CHRISTY
                             (surprised)
               I am?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You may stay.  But I shall restrict your 
               activities to but a single task.

                               CHRISTY
                             (with great dread)
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have, I believe, some minimal 
               background in music.  Therefore, you are 
               to join our choir.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               You will sing, and you will sleep,' that 
               is your schedule until you depart.  As 
               almost no one attends Mass, you will be 
               unable to cause further damage.

                               CHRISTY
               No.  No.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (smiling)
               You're my Olympic event.

                               CHRISTY
               Not the choir, please, anything but 
               that.  The choir -- I mean, have you 
               heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub 
               floors, toilets, you name it, but not 
               that I

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (in triumph)
               The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the 
               gold.

     There are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music. 
     Mary Lazarus is the group's leader; Mary Patrick and Mary 
     Robert are also in the choir.  Christy appears at the door, 
     grimacing.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this... choir practice?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.

     Christy spots Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last 
               night...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me.  
               You were only trying to help, to give me 
               experience.  I tried to explain that to 
               Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if 
               she understood.

     Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at 
     Christy.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Soprano or alto?

                               CHRISTY
                             (very gloomy)
               Whatever.

     Page 60.

     Mary Lazarus hands Christy a hymnal, and raps her baton. 
     The choir begins to sing; Christy doesn't even bother 
     trying.  She is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding 
     group in history.  They seem to be singing in several 
     random keys, and they even have trouble with the words.  No 
     one looks up from their hymnals.  Sister Alma, the organist 
     with the hearing aid, is plodding along.

     INT. BLUE COLLAR BAR - DAY

     Mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting 
     them on the floor as Joey and Willy enter.

                               JOEY
               We're looking for Mike.

                               MIKE
               You found him -- but we're not open yet.

     Willy grabs Mike's arms and bends them behind his back.

                               MIKE
               Hey -- the till's empty!

     Willy slams Mike's face into the wall, stunning him.  Joey 
     lifts Mike's groggy face and offers sympathy.

                               JOEY
               I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into 
               him.

                               MIKE
               Who are you guys?

                               JOEY
               We're the guys from Vegas.  You had 
               Christy last night, but you let her get 
               away.  It's upsetting.

     Willy hammers Mike's face into the wall again.

                               MIKE
               But you didn't tell me!

                               JOEY
               We didn't tell you what?

                               MIKE
               That she's a nun!  That chick you're 
               looking for -- she's a nun!

                               WILLY
               What?  Christy?

     Page 61.

                               JOEY
               A nun?

                               MIKE
               I'm telling you!

     Willy and Joey look at each other, and consider this.  
     Then they burst out laughing.  They refuse to believe 
     Mike's story.

                               WILLY
               Gimme a hand here.

     Willy and Joey pick Mike up, and hurl him over the bar. 
     Then they exit, still laughing.

                               JOEY
               A nun!

     INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

     The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn 
     Let Thy Thoughts He Guided.  Christy is not singing; she 
     is clearly in pain.  Mary Lazarus stops the song.  One of 
     the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Mary Clarence, are you with us?

                               CHRISTY
               Um, I don't really know this one...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence has a background in music. 
               That's what Reverend Mother said.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (eagerly)
               Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a 
               choirmistress?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (circling Christy)
               Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I 
               don't see?  You think I took vows 
               yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You 
               and Reverend Mother.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               You're a ringer.  She brought you in to 
               replace me.  Out with the old.

     Page 62.

                               CHRISTY
               Hold on.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, 
               you're terrific, but...
                             (to Christy)
               Could you help us?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               Please?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               You've heard us.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Well.

     Everyone falls silent.  Mary Lazarus walks across the 
     room, eyeballing each member of the choir.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               There's a word for this -- mutiny.
                             (to Christy)
               So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do 
               better.  I believe I'd like to see that.
                             (she hands Christy her 
                             pitchpipe and baton)
               I'm out to pasture.  Dry dock.  The glue 
               factory.  Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em 
               sing.

     Everyone watches Christy.

                               CHRISTY
               Well...
                             (to Nary Lazarus)
               With all due respect... let's have a 
               look at this.

     Christy goes over to the piano.  She examines the sheet 
     music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided."  She sits at the 
     piano, beside Sister Alma.  Christy picks out the hymn on 
     the piano, accompanying herself.

                               CHRISTY
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     Christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good.  She 
     stops singing.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she 
     has really heard herself.

                               CHRISTY
               Man.  I sound like you guys.

     Page 63.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (victorious)
               Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our 
               lesson?  I won't hold this little episode 
               against anyone.  I'll try not to.

                               CHRISTY
                             (standing)
               Mary Robert.

     Mary Robert jumps, startled by the attention. 

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You 
               never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing 
               comes out.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I don't want to mess anyone up...

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Sister Alma)
               Give me a C.
                             (because Sister Alma 
                             is hard of hearing)
               A C!

     Sister Alma plays the note.  Christy points the baton at 
     Mary Robert.  Mary Robert whispers the note.

                               CHRISTY
               Louder!  Like you're onstage.

     Mary Robert sings a little louder.

                               CHRISTY
               Like people are eating, and there's 
               silverware, and you want them to hear 
               you.

     Mary Robert sings louder still.

                               CHRISTY
               Think about that guy you were dancing 
               with!

     Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge 
     and glorious.  After singing a single perfect note, she 
     stops abruptly; she has scared herself.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my!

     Page 64.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  We've got the voices.  They're 
               just allover the place. I've heard all of 
               you, in the shower --you're decent.  
               Better than me.  We just need charts -- 
               harmony -- chops.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (puzzled)
               Chops?

                               CHRISTY
               The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's 
               rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, 
               you re not a natural soprano, you're an 
               alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with 
               the sopranos.

     The two nuns trade places.

                               CHRISTY
               Sister Alma -- a C.

     Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate 
     it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy 
     uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving 
     each her note, urging them closer to pitch.

                               CHRISTY
               Middle section, hold that note, for dear 
               life.  Sopranos, an A.  Sister Alma?

     Sister Alma hits the note.  Christy shuffles a couple of 
     more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going 
     with the altos, using her pitchpipe.

     For one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a 
     perfect chord.  They are elated.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We did it!  We actually sang a chord!

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (thrilled and 
                             disconcerted)
               That was exciting!

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, for one second.  That was the 
               blend -- you've got to listen to each 
               other.  Be a group.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (under her breath)
               I knew that.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you 
               like discipline.  Hard work.

     Page 65.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now.  
               The Lord hates a loafer.

                               CHRISTY
               I hear you.  How many days a week do you 
               rehearse?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Two days.  An hour or so.

                               CHRISTY
               No way.  We're a choir, right? 
               Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a 
               week won't cut it.  Every day.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (impressed)
               She's good.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to Christy)
               Do you really think we could do it?  Get 
               better?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you 
               think?  They're pretty raw.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Wet behind the ears.

                               CHRISTY
               A bunch of real mama's girls.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, please?  Can't we try?

     Christy and Mary Lazarus look at each other, as real 
     comrades.  Christy leans on Mary Lazarus' shoulder.

                               CHRISTY
               It'll be hell.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Tell me about it.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus shake hands, firmly.  Christy 
     turns to the choir, very businesslike.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten-hut!

     INT. CONVENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     This is a basement utility room.     A large industrial 
     washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a 
     repetitive CHUNG-CHUNG sound

     Page 66.

     The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others 
     fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long 
     table.  Christy is helping Mary Patrick fold a sheet.  
     Everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the 
     washer-dryer.

                               CHRISTY
               That machine.

                               MARY PATRICK
               I know.  It's ancient.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a rhythm section.  The beat.

     Christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the 
     washer-dryer; gradually, the other nuns join her.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Patrick -- do you remember the 
               Dixie Cups?

                               MARY PATRICK
               The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a 
               girl.  Of course.
                             (singing)
               SPRING IS HERE
               THE SUN WILL SHINE

                               CHRISTY
                             (stopping the beat)
               Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty 
               cheerful person, aren't you?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Am I?

     There is a murmur from all the other nuns -- "Oh, yes.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (as a confession)
               All right, I am, I know it!  All my 
               life, I've just been... upbeat. 
               Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. 
               Even when I was little, I remember my 
               mother used to say, "That child is pure 
               sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a 
               stewardess."

                               CHRISTY
               So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're 
               usually about rejoicing, right? 
               Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't 
               hold back.  Let all that joy go right 
               into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me 
               hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.

               Because we're

                               ALL THE NUNS
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED

                               MARY PATRICK
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL OF LOVE!

     The nuns have really gotten into the song, with Christy 
     encouraging them verbally.  They are sounding better and 
     better.

     SISTER MARY FREDERICK, a member of the choir, steps into 
     the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing 
     whistle.  The nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment 
     later Mother Superior enters.

     The room is quiet except for the sound of the washer-
     dryer. The nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks.

                               NUNS
                             (in unison)
               Good morning, Reverend Mother.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good morning, Sisters.

     Mother Superior takes one more glance around, then leaves.

     Now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, 
     quietly, to the rhythm of the machine.

                               NUNS
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL...

     INT. CHAPEL

     Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday Mass.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few 
               and faithful.

     Page 68.

     As usual, the chapel is almost empty, except for the nuns. 
     The choir is in place behind the pulpit.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               The choir, I am told, has elected a new 
               director -- Sister Mary Clarence, who 
               will lead them in Hymn 127.

     Christy nods to the Bishop, and signals to Sister Alma, 
     who begins the accompaniment.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     They sound fantastic.  Their voices blend with a heavenly 
     harmony as they sing the slow, melodic hymn.  Mother 
     Superior is startled by this new sound.

     EXT. STREET

     Lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with 
     curiosity as the beautiful MUSIC drifts out to the street.  
     A few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions.

     INT. CHAPEL

     At the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir 
     to stop.  There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances 
     at the vacant pews.  Then she turns to Sister Alma and 
     nods. Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord.

     Several of the nuns blink.  Bishop O'Hara glances at the 
     organ with surprise.  Mother Superior sits up with a 
     stiffened back and a severe expression.

     As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a 
     beat.

                               CHRISTY
               One, two, three...

     The choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn. 
     Christy strides up and down in front of the choir, 
     transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a 
     passionate call-and-response format.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

                               CHRISTY
               What you say?

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     Page 69.

                               CHRISTY
               But how?

                               CHOIR
               BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH

                               CHRISTY
               I think I hear it!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

                               CHRISTY
               You know, I just might!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR 
               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLY!

     Spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church.

     EXT. STREET

     The gorgeous, exciting MUSIC pours into the street.  
     Everyone turns to look.  Windows open and people glance 
     out. The street takes on a new movement.

     INT. CHAPEL

     The choir really lets loose flow.

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE STRENGTHENED
               LET THY PRAYERS BE HEARD
               LET OUR LORD REJOICE IN YOUR PRAISE
               LET HIS GOODNESS LIFT YOU TO A HIGHER 
               PLACE
               AND LET LOVE AND PEACE FILL YOUR DAYS

     Lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the 
     chapel.  Bishop O'Hara sees them, and beckons them to come 
     in.

                               CHRISTY
               Sister Alma!

     Sister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up 
     the organ with a solo.  More people from the street begin 
     to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music.

     At the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the 
     choir, and each member produces a tambourine.  The chapel 
     is full of energy, music and life.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert!

     Page 70.

     Mary Robert sings, really letting the power of her voice 
     ring out.  She is astonishingly good.

                               MARY ROBERT
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
               BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
               LET THY SOUL TAKE WING AND FLY!

     The new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to 
     the music, and after a few beats, the nuns join in.  Mother 
     Superior is aghast.

     The choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping 
     their eyes on Christy.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY
               You know what we're saying!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY
               I think they hear you!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLYI

     After the final note, everyone in the chapel is 
     exhilarated -- everyone except Mother Superior.  Christy 
     looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen 
     or more, including Lawanda and her friends.  Christy looks 
     happier than she has in years.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     The members of the choir are all gathered outside Mother 
     Superior's office, leaning close to the door and listening 
     to her harangue Christy.  They are surprised to find 
     themselves joined suddenly by Bishop O'Hara, and part to 
     let him through.  He leans down to the keyhole and listens.

     INT. OFFICE

     Mother Superior is livid.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Gospel.  A jazz solo on the organ.  What 
               next?  Jesus goes to Rio?  Good Friday-a-
               go-go?  What were you thinking?

     Page 71.

                               CHRISTY
               I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some 
               butts in those seats.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls?  
               This is not a theater.  or a casino.

                               CHRISTY
                             (sincerely)
               Exactly.  People like going to theaters 
               and casinos.  But they think church is 
               for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack 
               the joint.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted 
               the entire choir!

                               CHRISTY
               Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked 
               hard with them.  They gave up their free 
               time, and they loved it.  Those women are 
               happy.  And we can get even better.  We 
               can wake this place up.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Out of the question.

                               CHRISTY
               Please let me try.  I'm begging you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary 
               Lazarus will resume her leadership of
               the choir.

     Christy is crestfallen.  There is a KNOCK on the door, and 
     O'Hara enters.  The other members of the choir are in 
     behind him like sardines.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Reverend Mother, I just wanted to 
               congratulate you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Oh?

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in 
               years.  What a marvelous program. 
               Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be 
               commended.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Well... thank you.

     Page 72.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I can't wait until next Sunday, when the 
               choir performs again.  Did you see the
               people walk right in from the street? 
               That music, that heavenly music -- it 
               called to them.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Perhaps.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him 
               a personal letter, describing your
               efforts, your bold new fight to keep 
               your little convent alive.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Really?

     Christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me, Bishop.  Reverend Mother has 
               some other ideas too.  She's too modest 
               to talk about it, but she thinks we 
               should get out of the convent and into 
               the neighborhood more.
                             (putting her hands on 
                             Mother Superior's 
                             shoulders) 
               This woman.

     Mary Patrick jumps forward.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Bless her!  There are so many problems 
               in this neighborhood that we could help 
               solve.  That's why many of us became 
               nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (confused by the turn 
                             things have taken)
               Really...

                               CHRISTY
                             (with regard to Mother 
                             Superior)
               You know Reverend Mother.  Hides her 
               light under a bushel.  She has plans for 
               us to move right onto the streets.  Get 
               to know people.  Work with 'em.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
                             (to Mother Superior)
               You're a pioneer.

     Page 73.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this 
               is a most dangerous neighborhood.

                               O'HARA
               And you'll face that danger head-on.  As 
               if I could stop you.  And you have my 
               complete support in this matter. Anything 
               you can do to revitalize this 
               neighborhood would be a blessing.

                               CHRISTY
                             (hugging Mother 
                             Superior from behind)
               Don't you love her?

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the 
     convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright, 
     shining suns.  The CAMERA PANS to Christy, who is adding 
     her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray 
     paint.  Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a 
     miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that 
     read "St. Kate!"  People gather in the street, watching the 
     nuns' activities.  The convent begins to crackle with 
     energy and life.

     A drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the 
     DEALERS give only a curious glance to the action at the 
     convent.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S WINDOW

     From the window of her office, Mother Superior watches the 
     painters and feels her control slipping away.

     EXT. STREET - LATER

     Christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of 
     the street.  They get lots of attention each step of the 
     way.  As each nun raps, the other nuns make rhythmic boom-
     box noises.

                               CHRISTY
                             (rapping)
               WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE 
               DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (rapping)
               HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO
               DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR 
               YOU

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (rapping)
               BELIEVE IN THE LORD, HIS WILL BE DONE
               COME TO CHURCH, IT'S TONS OF FUN

     Page 74.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (rapping)
               DIG DOWN DEEP, GIVE ALL YOU CAN
               TRUST ME, CHILDREN, THERE'S A HEAVENLY 
               PLAN!

     The parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air 
     of jubilance prevails.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

     The rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir 
     is separated into several groups.  Christy has got the 
     whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast.

     Mary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they 
     practice synchronized movements with tambourines.  Colorful 
     streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make 
     colorful patterns in the air.

     Sister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary 
     Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes 
     they've only dreamed of in the past.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the 
     nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat 
     like the Temptations in skirts.  Mary Lazarus keeps the 
     beat with a yardstick.

                               CHRISTY
               Don't look at your feet, and I don't 
               want to see anybody counting.  Make it 
               look easy.  Again!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Right, right, cross with the left, spin 
               and turn!

     EXT. CRACK HOUSE - NIGHT

     One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as 
     a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.  He starts toward the 
     car as the DRIVER rolls down the window, but before he gets 
     there, Christy and several nuns surround the car.

     Page 75.

                               CHRISTY
               We're here to pray for you, brother.

                               DEALER
               What?  Get the hell out of here.

                               CHRISTY
               We know you don't want to sell drugs.  
               You just had an unhappy childhood, and 
               maybe a learning disability.  You just 
               need someone to pray for you.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We know you don't want to bring pain and 
               misery to your friends and neighbors. 
               We'll pray to find you some honest work.

                               CHRISTY
               And we know that, even though most 
               people would call you a leech and a 
               parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We 
               know that deep down inside, you're 
               probably even worse.  And so you truly 
               need our prayers.

                               DRIVER
               What is this?  Outta my way!

     The nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the 
     street.  A small crowd has begun to gather, and it is 
     growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the 
     nuns.  Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive 
     slowly past.

                               CHRISTY
               Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers 
               free  We're going to give free prayers to 
               everyone who drives up to this house.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to the Dealer)
               We're nuns!

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (to cruising cars)
               Free prayers right over here!  Drive up 
               and get your prayers!

                               DEALER
               You're hassling my customers!  That's 
               not legal!  I know my rights.  This is 
               restriction of trade.

                               CHRISTY
               You wanna call a cop?

     Page 76.

     The Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his 
     pocket.  Mary Patrick steps forward.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Are you going to shoot us all, tough 
               guy?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses 
               here.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the crowd)
               Can I get a witness?

     The Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns 
     a disgusted look.  He puts the gun away.

                               DEALER
               So I'll find another neighborhood to do 
               my business.  You can' t stop me.

                               CHRISTY
               If we can stop you here, they can stop 
               you there.

     The Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. 
     The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS.

     The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice 
     of a NEWS REPORTER.

                               NEWS REPORTER (V.0.)
               It was a truly remarkable scene, as the 
               nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove 
               the crack dealers from the neighborhood, 
               led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of 
     the nuns and neighbors still celebrating.  On top of the TV 
     are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife 
     and children.

     INT. VINCE LaROCCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CONNIE LaROCCA, Vince's wife, watches the TV NEWS STORY 
     and calls to Vince in the kitchen.

                               CONNIE
               Vinnie, get in here.  You gotta see 
               this!

     Carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, Vince 
     appears from the kitchen and glances at the TV screen to 
     see a shot of the convent.  He looks at Connie and makes a 
     sour face.

     Page 77.

                               VINCE
               What?  Nuns?  You got me in here to see 
               nuns?  Isn't there a ball game on or 
               something?

     Vince turns away from the TV just as a closeup of Christy 
     appears on the screen.

                               CONNIE
               Look -- she's adorable!

     Vince leaves the room, and we see Christy again as she 
     leads the choir.

     INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and 
     watching the NEWS on TV at the same time.  He pours himself 
     a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce.

                               NEWS REPORTER
               This tiny convent has experienced an 
               amazing turnaround.  The sisters have 
               revitalized and taken back their 
               neighborhood, all due to the energy and 
               talent of the convent choir, a group led 
               by this gifted young nun.  Tell us, Mary 
               Clarence1 what makes you so special?

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to appear 
                             modest and nun-like)
               Oh, I'm not special, Bob.  It's just 
               hard work... and prayer.

     Eddie all but spits out his wine.  His eyes are wide as he 
     watches Christy being interviewed.  In one stride, he grabs 
     his hat and coat and is out the door on the run.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The Sunday morning bell is CHIMING as crowds of people 
     stream into the convent.  The entire neighborhood looks 
     cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step. 
     Three local TV stations have remote news crews on the scene 
     doing follow-ups on the story.

     INT. CHAPEL HALLWAY

     Last in line, Christy follows the other choir members down 
     a hallway toward the chapel.  Suddenly, a hand reaches out 
     and grabs her, and a second hand covers her mouth as she is 
     pulled into an empty cell.

     INT. CELL

     Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, 
     but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.

     Page 78.

     Eddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!

                               EDDIE
               What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead 
               right now.  What are you doing giving 
               interviews on TV?

                               CHRISTY
               It wasn't my fault!  They just showed 
               up.  It's helping the convent.

                               EDDIE
               You're supposed to be hiding out!

                               CHRISTY
               I really can't talk about it now.  The 
               place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show 
               to do.

                               EDDIE
               Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career 
               opportunity.

                               CHRISTY
               I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's 
               about the choir.  You should hear them.
               They're good.  Really good.  And I 
               taught them.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.

                               CHRISTY
               I am?

                               EDDIE
               Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..

                               CHRISTY
                             (flirting)
               Really?  Lieutenant?

                               EDDIE 
               I've been worried about you.

     Eddie sits on the bed beside Christy.

                               CHRISTY
               You mean -- worried about my testimony?

                               EDDIE
               No -- worried about you.  Personally.

     Page 79.

                               CHRISTY
               Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking 
               about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there 
               aren't a lot of guys around here.  I 
               mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.

                               EDDIE
               Me too.

                               CHRISTY
               You're not... seeing anybody?

                               EDDIE
               No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about 
               you.  And now... you've really changed.

                               CHRISTY
               I have?

                               EDDIE
               You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes 
               are shining.  You're rea1ly different...

     Eddie and Christy are gazing into each other's eyes; they 
     are just about to kiss.  Their lips are less than an inch 
     apart.

                               EDDIE
               You're... you're a nun.

     Eddie and Christy jump apart, their intimacy has 
     frightened them both, particularly given Christy's outfit, 
     and their location.

                               CHRISTY
               We're in a convent!

     Christy goes to the door.

                               CHRISTY
               I've got to go.

                               EDDIE
               Just remember - you're a target.  Don't 
               you think Vince has a T.V.?

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to think 
                             straight)
               I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll 
               try.

     Christy begins to leave, and then she turns, filled with a 
     performer's excitement.

                               CHRISTY
               Magic time!

     Page 80.

     Christy hurries toward the chapel, leaving Eddie to shake 
     his head and wonder.

     INT. CHAPEL

     Sister Alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as 
     Christy addresses the congregation.  Cameras from several 
     TV stations are focussed on her from various places in the 
     chapel.

                               CHRISTY
               This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the 
               lesson of Mary Magdalene.  You know the 
               one.  Mary Magdalene was a young lady 
               with a past.  She was no stranger to sin.  
               She was no stranger to practically 
               everybody.  Many condemned her.  The 
               whole neighborhood.  But one man refused 
               to do so.  One man said, hey now, wait a 
               minute.  Listen to the story.

     Sister Alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp.  Mary Patrick 
     and Mary Robert step forward from the choir, standing 
     beside Christy the way the Ronelles used to do.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, girls. 

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Hail, Mary.

                               CHRISTY
               Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody 
               hates me.

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Oh-huh.

                               CHRISTY
               People throw stones.  They call me 
               names.  I mean, really.

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Really.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- wait.

                               MARY PATRICK
               What is it, Mary?

                               CHRISTY
               That man -- who is he?

                               MARY ROBERT
               He's a carpenter.

     Page 81

                               MARY PATRICK
               He's not like other guys.

                               MARY ROBERT
               He's decent.

                               MARY PATRICK
               He's kind.

                               CHRISTY
               He's... dreamy.  He's...

                               CHOIR
               Yes, Mary?

                               CHRISTY
               HE'S SO FINE...

     The full choir sings back-up while Christy, Mary Patrick 
     and Mary Robert perform intricate girl group choreography.

                               CHOIR
               DOO- LANG, DOO-LANG, DOO- LANG.

                               CHRISTY/MARY ROBERT/ MARY PATRICK
               WISH HE WAS MINE
               THAT HANDSOME GUY OVER THERE
               THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR

     Sister Alma is surrounded by several STREET KIDS who play 
     guitar, bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir.

     Lawanda and her friends sit in a pew, moving joyously to 
     the music.

     Eddie stands in the back of the chapel, watching a Christy 
     he has never seen before.  Christy is now glowing with 
     happiness and confidence.

     As the song continues, we see the chapel is packed to the 
     rafters.  A tin bucket is passed around as a collection 
     plate, and it overflows with money.

     EXT. CONVENT

     Church services are over, and happy people stream out of 
     the convent, but they don't hurry home.  Standing in 
     groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day. 
     There is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the 
     block.

     Eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, 
     smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car.

     Page 82.

     INT. CHAPEL

     Christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that 
     is filled with money.

                               CHRISTY
               Jackpot!  Two buckets

                               MARY PATRICK
               This is so exhilarating!  All week long, 
               I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I'd rather sing than do anything!

                               MARY PATRICK
               It's better than ice cream.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's better than springtime.

                               CHRISTY
               It's better than sex!

     Everyone looks at Christy with astonishment.

                               CHRISTY
                             (catching herself)
               I imagine.

     Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he 
     approaches.

                               O'HARA
               Better and better, Sisters, you are 
               truly an inspiration.  And I bear 
               gladsome tidings.

     The choir gathers around O'Hara with curiosity.

                               O'HARA
               I've kept the Cardinal informed of your 
               progress in the neighborhood.  He has 
               been most impressed.  And he has invited 
               you to attend a special evening Mass at 
               St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 
               to sing for the Council of Cardinals.

     The choir reacts with an excited buzz:  "The Council of 
     Cardinals!", "What shall we sing?", etc.

     Mother Superior appears, from the center aisle.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We 
               will be honored to appear.

               And on such an occasion, I feel a 
               completely traditional program will be 
               best.

                               CHRISTY
               What do you mean?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The council of Cardinals is perhaps the 
               most esteemed body in the entire Catholic 
               church.  They command the utmost respect.  
               Your more... secular entertainment would 
               be wholly out of place.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves 
               our new style.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's brought people back to the church.

                               CHRISTY
               Isn't that why we were asked to sing for 
               those Cardinals?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I believe this can be settled by a 
               simple vote.

                               CHRISTY
               A vote?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is 
               not a totalitarian state.  Most major 
               decisions are made by the membership as a 
               whole.  A membership that, I am certain, 
               will vote in a rational and pious manner.  
               All those in favor of allowing Mary 
               Clarence to select a program?

     All the nuns look at one another.  Then, slowly, one by 
     one, they all raise their hands.

     Mother Superior is pure steel at this moment; her 
     expression betrays no emotion.  Christy, on the other hand, 
     is quite confused.

                               CHRISTY
               But... wait a minute...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The majority has spoken.

     Page 84.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Reverend Mother, as always, you are a 
               true leader.  Gracious and understanding.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother. 
               You'll see.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (gesturing to Christy)
               She's a pro.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I am certain the presentation will be a 
               great success.  Congratulations, Mary 
               Clarence.  And congratulations to you 
               all.

     The nuns cheer, and cluster around Christy, chattering 
     about the upcoming concert, as Mother Superior strides off.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Seated at her desk, Mother Superior glances up as Christy 
     enters.

                               CHRISTY
               You sent for me?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have a phone call.

     Mother Superior continues with her paperwork as Christy 
     picks up the phone.

                               CHRISTY
               Hello?

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Good news, kid.  I pulled a few strings 
               the judge has agreed to move the trial
               up.  We'll be in court in a couple of 
               days.

     With mixed emotions, Christy speaks softly.

                               CHRISTY
               That soon?

     Mother Superior is a very interested eavesdropper.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a 
               free woman.

     Page 85.

                               CHRISTY
               Great.  That's good to hear.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Hey, don't thank me or anything.

                               CHRISTY
               Right, right -- thanks.

     Christy hangs up the phone.  She looks at Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey -- your prayers have been answered.  
               I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Really.  Well, that makes two of us.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I have submitted my resignation to 
               Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked 
               to be relocated as soon as possible.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- why?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I must go where I can be of use.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- there's so much more to do right 
               here.  And look, if it's about me, I 
               mean, I'm gone.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks?  
               I have been here thirty years.  And yet, 
               it would seem, I know nothing.

                               CHRISTY
               But everything that's happening is good!  
               You can be a part of it!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is 
               one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into 
               town and declare a holiday.  You have 
               raised the Sisters' expectations, you 
               have excited and confused them.  They 
               imagine this neighborhood to be some sort 
               of delightful ongoing block party.

                             (MORE)

     Page 86.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               You and I know that life is not so 
               simple.  There will be disappointments.  
               Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished.  
               How... fortunate.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, so I just got things started.  But 
               you could build on that.  You could keep 
               it going.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to 
               have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, 
               Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
               But...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good day.

     Christy, frustrated, leaves the room.  Mother Superior 
     looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her 
     choices.

     EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT

     The moon casts shafts of silver light down to the 
     courtyard of the convent.  Most of the lights in the 
     neighborhood are out at this late hour.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
                             (whispering)
               Come on... I've got a surprise...

     INT. CONVENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

     The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle 
     carried by Christy.  Three more candles appear, carried by 
     Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus.  The door to 
     the freezer opens, and light spills out.  Christy removes 
     several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the 
     nuns.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (delighted)
               Ice cream!

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. 
               Where did you get this?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               It's a sin.  It's a wicked indulgence. 
               Is this butter almond?

     Page 87.

     Christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice 
     cream by candlelight.

                               CHRISTY
               It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I 
               wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... 
               thank-you gift.

                               MARY ROBERT
               A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one 
               we should be thanking.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Is there any syrup?

                               CHRISTY
               Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't 
               always... real popular.  I was sort of 
               selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, 
               I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. 
               But now, thanks to all of you... maybe 
               I'm shaping up.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're 
               an example to us all.  You've taught us 
               so much.  We're singing for the 
               Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe 
               the choir can travel -- to schools, and 
               nursing homes.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Maybe we can get some of the local kids 
               to sing with us.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.

                               CHRISTY
                             (knowing she has to 
                             leave)
               That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of 
               course, we never know when things are 
               going to change.  Any one of us could be 
               transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (worried)
               Are you leaving us?

                               CHRISTY
                             (sincerely)
               Oh no.  We'll always be together.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               That's what Diana Ross said.

     Page 88.

     Christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice 
     cream, in a spirit of true friendship.

     Mother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows 
     by the door to the kitchen.  She has begun to see Christy 
     in a new light.  She looks thoughtful, and walks off.

     INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

     Tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the 
     sports section.  HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the 
     police department, looks stressful as he enters the room 
     and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office.  Tate glances up 
     as Parker passes his desk.

                               TATE
               You're too late.  Mulcahy just left.

                               PARKER
               I need his signature on some things. 
               They can't be processed without it.

                               TATE
               Leave 'em.  He'll sign 'em later.

     Parker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from 
     procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the 
     file folder on Tate's desk and walks away.

     Tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside.  Bored, 
     looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and 
     glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for 
     equipment, supplies, etc.  Tate is about to close the 
     folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.

                               TATE
               What the hell is this...?

     He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. 
     Katherine's Convent in San Francisco.  It only takes a 
     moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for 
     his phone and dials a number.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Henry Parker waits for the elevator.  When it opens, he's 
     surprised to see Eddie step out.

                               PARKER
               Tate said you were gone.

                               EDDIE
               I get all the way down to my car, and, 
               of course -- where are the keys?

     Page 89.

                               PARKER
               I left the money vouchers with him.  He 
               said you'd sign them in the morning.

     Eddie nods and moves on as Parker enters the elevator. 
     After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.  He 
     picks up his pace.  A little panicky, he begins to jog 
     toward the squad room.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     Vince is on the telephone.  He signals Joey and Willy, and 
     they move quickly toward him.

                               VINCE
               This is it.  Get ready to move.  No 
               mistakes.  Grab her, get her to the 
               Moonlight.  We meet there, and we take 
               care of her.
                             (into phone)
               We're on it.  Give me the address.

     Vince begins to write down the address.

     INT. SQUAD ROOM

     Tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with 
     his back to the rest of the room.  The voucher for St. 
     Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward 
     him.

                               TATE
               St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. 
               It's gotta be the place.

     Tate hangs up the phone and BOOM!  Eddie hits him from 
     behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor.  Other 
     detectives look up from their desks with confusion and 
     alarm.  Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the 
     voucher from his hand.

                               EDDIE
               You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!

     Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he 
     can hit Tate.

                               EDDIE
               Get him out of here!  Downstairs, in the 
               cell!  I want his ass locked up now!

     Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two 
     detectives drag Tate away.  Eddie grabs Tate's phone and 
     dials long distance.

                               EDDIE
               Clarkson, get on the other line.  Call 
               Frisco Central.  Tell 'em to get two 
               squad cars outside St. Katherine's 
               convent, and stop anybody with an out-of-
               state license plate from getting near the 
               place.

     Clarkson dials quickly.  Eddie listens to Tate's telephone 
     as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.

     INT. CONVENT - DAY

     All the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a 
     hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends.  Those who are 
     not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm.  War in the 
     background, we can hear the telephone RINGING.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the 
     SIREN screaming.  It blazes through traffic, weaving in and 
     out at breakneck speeds.  A moment later, Joey and Willy 
     pull onto the highway at a fast rate.  The race is on, with 
     Eddie securely in the lead.

     INT. CONVENT - DAY

     In the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on 
     their robes.  Christy and several nuns are all trying to 
     primp in front of one small mirror.

                               MARY ROBERT
               The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so 
               nervous!  What if I forget the words?

                               CHRISTY
               Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is 
               that bus?

                               MARY PATRICK
               It should be here any minute.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (with a clipboard)
               Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 
               8:30.  Sharp.

     Christy looks out the window, but sees no bus.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks toward L.A.

     Page 91.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off.  
     Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across 
     the street:  "ST. KATE'S - THE GREATEST!", "GOOD LUCK 
     TONIGHT!"

     A Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in 
     front.  Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry 
     onto the bus.  A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks 
     up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the 
     corner from the bus.

     INT. CONVENT

     Eddie runs into the convent and finds Mother Superior at 
     the bottom of the stairs.

                               EDDIE
               Reverend Mother!  Quick!  Where's 
               Christy?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               What's wrong?

                               EDDIE
               They know she's here!   They're on their 
               way!

     Mother Superior points up the stairs.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The rehearsal room!

     Mother Superior looks alarmed as Eddie takes the stairs 
     two at a time.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM

     Looking out the window, Mary Robert sees the bus.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's here!  Let's go!

     Everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then 
     the group leaves the room to head for the bus.  Mary Robert 
     and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Hurry, Sister!

                               CHRISTY
               Get moving.  I'm right behind you.

     Christy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves 
     the room.  She is puzzled to suddenly see Eddie running 
     toward her from a side staircase.

     Page 92.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie...?

     Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side 
     staircase.

                               EDDIE
               Vince knows you're here.

                               CHRISTY
                             (shocked and scared)
               How?

                               EDDIE
               Long story.  His goons will be here any 
               minute.  We've got to get you out of here 
               '- now!

     Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side 
     entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes.  Eddie 
     opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her 
     tracks.

                               CHRISTY
               I can't go with you.

                               EDDIE
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's 
               Cathedral.  We're singing for the 
               Cardinals.

                               EDDIE
               You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if 
               you don't get your ass out of here!

     Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly 
     to the car.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR

     Eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street.  As the car 
     cruises through an intersection, Christy looks back at the 
     bus with confusion and sadness.  She sees the other nuns 
     rushing back into the convent to look for her.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM

     Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic 
     in their eyes.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence!  Sister!

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's no use.  She just isn't here.

     Page 93.

                               MARY PATRICK
               It doesn't make any sense.  She was 
               right behind me...

     The HORN on the school bus blows loudly down in the 
     street.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We can't sing without her!  What should 
               we do?

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (calming herself)
               We'll pray -- and she'll be there.

     The nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice. 
     They leave the room to join the others on the bus.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks through crowded streets.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR

     Christy still looks unsettled.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They 
               won't sing without me.  I'm deserting 
               them.

                               EDDIE
               I think they'd understand.

                               CHRISTY
               That's not the point!  They need me!

     Eddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the 
     convent has had.

                               EDDIE
               They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For 
               what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?

                               CHRISTY
               You don't get it!  It's a big thing for 
               them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. 
               Prime-time.  They're singing for the 
               Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." 
               If first prize was a trip to the Vatican.  
               They've worked really hard, they deserve 
               this.

                               EDDIE
                             (goading her)
               Nuns?

     Page 94.

                               CHRISTY
               They're not nuns.  They're like.. 
               people.  With one outfit.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     Joey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get 
     out quickly and climb the steps to the front door.  They 
     ring the bell.

                               JOEY
               So that guy in the bar was right?  She's 
               like... some kind of nun?

                               WILLY
               Yeah, right -- when I see it.

     Lawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on 
     the convent door.

                               LAWANDA
               You dudes looking for nuns?  They all 
               went to St. Matthew's.

                               JOEY
               St, Matthew's?  Thanks.

                               LAWANDA
               Praise the Lord.

     Joey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and 
     take off.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

     Eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel 
     gauge is close to empty.  He wheels into a gas station and 
     pulls up to the tanks.  Christy starts to open the door, 
     but he stops her.

                               EDDIE
               What're you doing?

                               CHRISTY
               Even nuns have to pee.

     He lets her go, then gets out to pump gas.

     INT. WOMEN'S ROOM

     Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted.  She fondles 
     her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.  This position 
     doesn't work for her; she stands.  She looks around her; 
     she glances up, toward heaven.  She decides to do things 
     simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.

     Page 95.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, it's me.  Mary Clarence.  Christy. 
               It's Chris Carter.  I need some help 
               here.  I can't believe I'm doing this. 
               Okay, look, I know I should just get back 
               in the car, and get the hell out of here.  
               Save my skin.  I mean, it's not wrong, 
               Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you 
               make guys like Vince?  But if I don't 
               sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert.  
               Mary Patrick.  It means so much to them.  
               They're counting on me -- and I like 
               that.  Maybe Reverend Mother is right, 
               maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm 
               just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a 
               deal here?  I mean, I still don't believe 
               in, like, most of the Commandments, and 
               stuff in church still gives me the 
               willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if 
               I do a good deed, will you promise I 
               won't get killed?  All I want is a sign.  
               Lightning.  Thunder. Anything.

     Suddenly, Christy hears the toilet FLUSH in the next 
     bathroom.

                               CHRISTY
                             (in disbelief)
               No.  No.  Doesn't count...

     Suddenly, Christy hears "AVE MARIA" coming from a radio or 
     TV outside the bathroom.  She looks up; a ray of sunlight 
     illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament 
     hanging from a room deodorizer.  The ornament is a glittery 
     angel; it sparkles in the light.

     Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure.

     EXT. GAS STATION

     Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station 
     office.  A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV. 
     On the TV is an episode of "THE FLYING NUN":  Sally Field, 
     in full habit, is soaring along.

     Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle 
     starting up over by one of the gas pumps.  The BIKER turns 
     and looks at Christy:  he has long hair, and a beard and 
     moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my God...

     Christy runs up to the Biker..

                               CHRISTY
               I'm late for church.  Can I get a lift?

     Page 96.

     Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his 
     Harley in gear and flies down the street.  Eddie is shocked 
     as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car 
     to follow.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

     We see a network truck parked in front of the landmark 
     cathedral.

     INT. CHAPEL

     There is a sense of chaos in the chapel as TECHNICIANS set 
     up television equipment, and Mother Superior leads the 
     choir as it rehearses.  Near the back of the chapel, Bishop 
     O'Hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir. A 
     CARDINAL walks up to Bishop O'Hara.

                               CARDINAL
               Is this the choir you've been speaking 
               so highly of, Bishop?

                               O'HARA
               They're just a bit nervous.  They'll be 
               fine.

     The choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn. 
     Mary Patrick is close to tears.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We sound terrible   We need Mary 
               Clarence.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We're losing it.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I don't understand.  Where is she?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must 
               proceed without her.  Pull yourselves 
               together.

     Clapping his hands briskly, the FLOOR DIRECTOR suddenly 
     steps forward from behind the TV cameras and hustles the 
     choir away from the altar.

                               FLOOR DIRECTOR
               Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now. 
               That was great, just great.  Charlie, 
               throw a spot on the pulpit.  Let's get a 
               balance.

     Dispirited, the choir leaves the altar and walks toward 
     the back of the church.

     Page 97.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET

     The motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every 
     traffic law on the books.  Christy's robe flaps behind her 
     in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides.  As 
     passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and 
     blesses them.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, 
     wringing her hands with worry.  Suddenly, her face 
     brightens like the dawn as she sees Christy ride up.

                               MARY ROBERT
               You're here!  Thank goodness!

     INT. CATHEDRAL

     Christy and Mary Robert rush down a side corridor, turn a 
     corner and see two TV Technicians standing near some cables 
     with the letters of the network embroidered on the backs of 
     their jackets.  Christy rushes up to them and taps them on 
     the shoulders.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?

     The two Technicians turn toward her, and she is horrified 
     to see they are. Joey and Willy.  Christy gasps as Willy 
     sticks a gun in her ribs.  Joey smiles at her.

                               JOEY
               The rehearsal room is right this way.

     Joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the 
     cathedral.  Mary Robert looks confused.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?

                               CHRISTY
               They're from my old convent.

     Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he 
     buckles over.  She scrambles for the gun, but Joey beats 
     her to it.  Christy looks frantically at Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Run!  Take off! 

                               MARY ROBERT
               Again?

     Revived Willy lunges for Mary Robert and grabs her.  The 
     two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the 
     alley.

     Page 98.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Joey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of 
     their car.  They shove Christy and Mary Robert into the 
     back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them.

                               WILLY
               Go!

     Joey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING 
     tires.  Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits 
     beside Mary Robert.

                               MARY ROBERT
               But what do they want?  Where are we 
               going?

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Joey and Willy)
               She's got nothing to do with this.  Let 
               her go.

                               JOEY
               Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what 
               we talked about?  Experience?

                               JOEY
               What?

                               CHRISTY
                             (quickly, to Mary 
                             Robert)
               You can handle this.

     The car comes to a stop at an intersection.  Christy 
     reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door.  She 
     shoves Mary Robert into the street.

                               CHRISTY
               Go!

     Mary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the 
     sidewalk.  She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs 
     back to the cathedral.

     Willy grabs Christy before she can escape.

                               JOEY
               She's gettin' away!

                               WILLY
               Forget her!  We got the one we need! 
               Step on it!

     Joey takes off again.

     EXT. STREET

     Eddie's car is tied up in traffic, but he turns on his 
     blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane.  Cars 
     stop to let him through.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

     In the rehearsal room, Mary Robert has just finished 
     telling the nuns what happened to Christy.

                               MARY PATRICK
               You mean -- they kidnapped her?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               She shouldn't have come back.  She knew 
               she was in danger.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Were they Catholics?

     Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               She isn't a nun.  Her real name is 
               Christy Van Cartier, and she is a 
               professional entertainer.  She witnessed 
               a vicious crime, and has been hiding in 
               our convent.

     The nuns all react with shock and emotion.

                               MARY ROBERT
               An... entertainer?

                               MARY PATRICK
               She wasn't a nun? 

                               ANOTHER NUN
               She lied to us?

                               MARY ROBERT
               But... but... she was such a wonderful 
               nun.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Look what she did with the choir.  She 
               made us sing beautifully.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               That should have tipped us.

     Page 100.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't 
               sing without her!

                               MARY PATRICK
               She's our inspiration!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               She's the act!

                               MARY ROBERT
               Reverend Mother, I know that you and 
               Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but --
               we've got to help her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We've got to save her!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We can't leave it up to the Feds!

     The nuns all look to Mother Superior for an answer.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, 
               do you have any idea who those men were?

                               MARY ROBERT
               She said they were from her old convent.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't 
               have an old convent.

                               MARY PATRICK
               She told us about one.  The Little 
               Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               All right.  It's a beginning.  Las 
               Vegas, Nevada.

     All the nuns hurriedly cross themselves.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell 
               him the situation.  Everyone else --
               follow me.

     Mother Superior leads the way out the door.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Driver sits at the wheel of the school bus, reading a 
     sleazy novel.  He looks up as the nuns all converge on the 
     door.

     Page 101

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Emergency!  Open up!

     The Driver opens the door.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The San Francisco airport!  Immediately!

     The nuns are all zooming past the Driver, onto the bus.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (to the Driver)
               Step on it!

     Mary Lazarus grabs the Driver's sleazy novel, confiscating 
     it. The Driver starts the engine.  As the bus drives off, 
     Eddie's car streaks INTO THE SCENE and parks in front of 
     the cathedral.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     Eddie rushes into the lobby and sees Bishop O'Hara.

                               EDDIE
               Where is she?

                               O'HARA
               There was a kidnapping.  We think Las 
               Vegas.

     Eddie turns and races back toward the car.

     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Several small planes are parked on the tarmac.

     Mother Superior and the nuns are arguing with the MANAGER 
     of the airport, a grouchy guy in grease-stained overalls.

                               MANAGER
               Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas. 
               Rock-bottom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But we don't have fifteen hundred!

                               MARY ROBERT
               We're nuns!

     The Manager starts back toward his office.

                               MANAGER
               Can't help you.  No exceptions.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Young man!

     Page 102.

     The voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the 
     Manager looks around.

                               MANAGER
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR 
               We are nuns.  We pray.

                               MANAGER
               So?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We pray for good things.  Food for the 
               hungry.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Peace on Earth.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               However, we can also pray for other 
               things.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Measles.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Lawsuits.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Tax audits.

     There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in 
     horror.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Come, Sisters.  Let's go to chapel.  
               Bring your beads.

     The nuns begin to leave.

                               MANAGER
               Wait!

     EXT. NIGHT SKY - LATER

     A plane sweeps through the desert sky, headed for Las 
     Vegas.  Through the windows of the plane, we see nuns 
     staring out at the glittering city in the distance.

     INT. MOONLIGHT CASINO - NIGHT

     Packed with gamblers, the room is a flurry of activity. 
     Joey works his way through the crowd, then spots Vince near 
     the money cage.

                               JOEY
               We got her.

     Page 103.

     Vince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim 
     expression.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM

     Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with 
     boxes.  Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, 
     with Willy standing guard over her.

     Christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in.  
     She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity.

                               VINCE
                             (turning on the charm)
               Babe.

     Christy does not reply.

                               VINCE
               Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.

                               CHRISTY
               Good evening, Vincent.

                               VINCE
               What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I 
               know you.  What did you think you were 
               doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out.  
               No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?

                               CHRISTY
               I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.

     Vince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed.

                               WILLY
               She's a nun, Vince.

                               VINCE
                             (kneeling by Christy)
               I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I 
               gave you so much.  My time.  My 
               affection.  A big-time career.  And how 
               do you repay me?  What's the thanks I 
               get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's 
               the love?

                               CHRISTY
               You will be judged, Vincent.  We all 
               will.

     Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked.  He's getting 
     angry.

                               VINCE
               What do you mean -- judged?  I don't get 
               judged, baby.

     Page 104.

                               VINCE (CONT'D)
               And who are you to talk?  You were 
               nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must 
               have been out of my mind.

                               WILLY
               She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since 
               we picked her up.

                               JOEY
               It's spooky.  It's like she ain't even 
               afraid or nothing.

     Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it 
     tightly around her throat.

                               VINCE
               She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys 
               you're afraid.

                               CHRISTY
                             (calmly)
               I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I 
               forgive you.

     This really throws Vince, and angers him further.  He 
     glares at Christy, and then releases her.  He turns to Joey 
     and Willy.

                               VINCE
               Who gives a damn?  Waste her.

     Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of 
     the room.

     INT. PLANE

     The nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its 
     colorful flashes of neon.

                               MARY PATRICK
               It's so beautiful...

                               MARY ROBERT
                And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And Gommorah.

     The plane sets down at the Vegas airport.  Mother Superior 
     and the nuns climb out.

     INT. BAR AREA

     Joey and Willy find Vince near the bar.

     Page 105.

                               VINCE
               It's done?

                               JOEY
               Not... totally.

                               VINCE
                             (disturbed)
               What's the problem?

                               WILLY
               She's... she's a nun.

                               VINCE
               Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's 
               Christy.  She's a babe!

                               JOEY
               But, Vince, how do you know she didn't 
               like, join up and become a nun when she 
               was in that convent?

                               VINCE
               It didn't happen.

                               WILLY
               She was real quiet and peaceful all the 
               way back in the car.

                               JOEY
               No smart-ass remarks or nothing.

                               VINCE
               I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both 
               you guys to go back there, and both of 
               you shoot her at the same time.

                               JOEY
               Yeah...

                               WILLY
               Right.  That way we'd never know which 
               bullet got to her brain and killed her 
               first.  It could always be the other guy.

     They all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy 
     leave.

     INT. STOREROOM

     Christy still shows no signs of fear as Joey and Willy 
     take out their guns.

                               JOEY
               Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three 
               we both shoot.  Got it?

     Page 106.

                               WILLY
               Got it.

     Joey points his gun at Christy's left temple, and Willy 
     points his gun at her right temple.

                               JOEY
               One... two...

     Christy closes her eyes.

                               JOEY
               Three!

     Neither man shoots.  They look at each other with anger. 
     Christy opens her eyes.

                               JOEY
               You didn't shoot!

                               WILLY
               Neither did you!

                               JOEY
               I figured if you were gonna, then I 
               wouldn't have to.

                               WILLY
               That's what I figured, too.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS HELIPORT

     The nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out 
     front.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But where?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Look!  There she is!

     Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that 
     feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos.  The 
     center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel, 
     the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles.  The 
     bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the 
     Moonlight Casino and Lounge.

                               MARY ROBERT
               The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!

                               MARY PATRICK
               But how do we get there?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Stand back.
                             (she strides into the 
                             road)
               Taxi!

     INT. CASINO

     Once again, Joey and Willy find Vince.

                               VINCE
               Well?

                               JOEY
               It didn't work, Vince.

                               VINCE
               You were both supposed to put your guns 
               to her head and shoot.

                               WILLY
               We both missed.

                               VINCE
               Okay, so the problem is still the nun 
               outfit, right?

                               JOEY
               Right.

                               VINCE
               So, take it off.

                               WILLY
                             (shocked)
               Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?

                               JOEY
               For like, twelve zillion eternities?

                               VINCE
               I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get 
               her out of the nun outfit, and put her in 
               some clothes.

                               JOEY
               Maybe pants.

                               WILLY
               A sweater.

                               JOEY
               And then we can ice her.  No nun, no 
               evil eye.

     Joey and Willy are very confident about this solution. 
     They strut off, pleased with themselves.

     Page 108.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT
     Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight 
     than the nuns.  A squad car is waiting; Clarkson beckons 
     him.

                               CLARKSON
               Lieutenant!

     Eddie jumps in the car.  Clarkson turns on the red bubble 
     light and the SIREN, and the car zooms off.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

     Joey and Willy return to the storage room, looking 
     confident of their mission this time.  Christy glances up 
     at them as they enter, and Willy begins to untie her.

                               WILLY
               We got it all worked out.

     He works the ropes free, and Christy rubs her wrists to 
     get circulation back again.

                               JOEY
               Okay, Christy -- strip.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               JOEY
               That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it 
               off.

     Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.

                               WILLY
               What's she doing?

                               JOEY
               She's praying.

                               CHRISTY
               And God bless Joey and Willy, who are 
               only trying to do their jobs.
                             (faking Latin)
               Pox fibula tibia vobiscum.  Et marcus 
               domino's pizza.  Have mercy.  Amen.
                             (she looks up at the 
                             guys)
               I'm finished now.  Help me up.

     As Joey and Willy bend down to help her up, Christy 
     suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand.  With a fierce 
     jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing 
     Joey's head against Willy's.

     Page 109.

     Stunned, Joey and Willy stagger backward, holding their 
     heads.  Christy scrambles out the door while the two men 
     groan in pain.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Joey and Willy burst out of the room with guns drawn.  At 
     the far end of the corridor, they spot a glimpse of black 
     clothing as Christy starts down the stairs.

                               JOEY
               There she goes!  she's taking the stairs 
               I

     They run quickly after her.

     INT. STAIRWAY

     Christy runs down the stairs as a SHOT rings out.  Christy 
     screams and runs even faster.

     INT. CASINO

     A door swings open into the casino, and Christy appears, 
     looking frantic.  A MUFFLED SHOT is heard behind her, and 
     she sprints into the casino.

     Seconds later, Joey and Willy appear.

                               JOEY
               Find Vince and tell him what happened. 
               I'll take this side of the room.

     Willy hurries away to find Vince, and Joey starts 
     searching the crowd.

     EXT. THE MOONLIGHT HOTEL AND CASINO

     Three cabs ROAR up in front of the building and nuns 
     tumble out.

     INT. CASINO ENTRANCE

     The nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks. 
     Before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin, 
     the SOUND of jackpots and crap tables.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Brace yourselves, Sisters.

     In unison, the nuns all cross themselves.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. 
               Try to blend in.

     The nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for 
     Christy.

     Page 110.

     INT. CASINO

     A blackjack table; a game is in progress, with several 
     players.  Mary Patrick rushes up to the table.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?

                               MARY ROBERT
               A Benedictine.

     The CROUPIER and the players stare at the two nuns. 

     INT. CASINO

     Christy is making her way past a roulette table.  
     Suddenly, she sees Joey coming toward her, making his way 
     through the crowd.  Christy grabs the arm of a SALESMAN 
     playing roulette.

                               CROUPIER
               Place your bets. 

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the Salesman)
               Red 21.

                               SALESMAN
               You sure?  How do you know?

     Christy looks up to heaven.

                               SALESMAN
                             (to the Croupier)
               Red 21.

     Joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table, 
     glaring at Christy.  The crowd around the table watches 
     Christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on 
     Red 21.

     Joey starts working his way around the table toward 
     Christy as the Croupier spins the wheel.  The ball falls 
     into a slot.

                               CROUPIER
               Black 14.

     Everyone at the table turns toward Christy, outraged.  She 
     gives them a reprimanding look.

                               CHRISTY
               Did you learn something?

     Christy suddenly realizes that Joey is almost at her side. 
     She shoves the Salesman against him and runs away.

     Page 111.

     INT. CASINO

     We see two long rows of slot machines, with gamblers 
     working every machine.

     Willy appears at one end of the row, scanning the area for 
     Christy.  He sees a nun crossing at the far end of the row, 
     and she moves out of sight.  Willy heads in that direction. 
     Someone hits a JACKPOT behind him, and he turns toward the 
     sound.  As he does. he sees another nun crossing at the 
     opposite end of the row of machines.  Willy turns again --
     now he sees three nuns crossing at the opposite end.  He 
     looks confused, and doesn't know which way to turn.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Eddie drives up in the squad car and parks near the back 
     door.

                               EDDIE
                             (to Clarkson)
               Close off the block, but don't move in 
               till I tell you.

     Eddie jumps out of the car and hurries inside.

     INT. BLACKJACK AREA

     As Christy moves past a blackjack game, she suddenly sees 
     Vince moving toward her.  Turning quickly, she moves away 
     from Vince, but suddenly sees Joey coming toward her from 
     the opposite direction.  Trapped for a moment, she has 
     panic in her eyes.  Suddenly she is flanked by Mother 
     Superior and Mary Patrick.

                               CHRISTY
               What are you doing here?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Saving you.  Move!

     The nuns surround Christy and head through the crowd in a 
     cluster.  Joey and Vince pursue them from different 
     directions.  Just before they catch them, Mother Superior 
     barks an order.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Break!

     The nuns split up, each taking a different direction. 
     Vince and Joey look bewildered.

                               VINCE
               Get her!

                               JOEY
               Which one!

     Page 112.

                               VINCE
               The nun!

     Vince, Joey and Willy each pick a nun and follow her.

     Vince catches up to a nun, whom we only see from the rear. 
     He grabs her shoulder.

                               VINCE
               Babe.

     The nun spins around; it is Mother Superior.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sweetheart.

     Vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd 
     again.

     Joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is Mary 
     Patrick.  The shell game has worked; Christy has escaped 
     for the moment.

     INT. SLOT MACHINE AREA

     We FIND Eddie scanning the floor and seeing nuns spread 
     out everywhere.  He talks quietly into his walkie-talkie.

                               EDDIE
               Move in.  Seal off the exits, but don't 
               come inside till I tell you.

     INT. CASINO

     Vince, Joey and Willy run into each other in the center of 
     the casino.

                               WILLY
               There's nuns everywhere!  Hundreds of 
               'em!

     All the nuns suddenly come together, and see that the 
     exits are blocked by Vince and his hoods.  Vince spots 
     Christy in the center of the group.

                               VINCE
               There she is!

                               JOEY
               Which one?

     Christy sees Vince pointing at her.

                               CHRISTY
               Quick, there's another way out of here.  
               Follow me.

     Page 113.

     Christy runs toward a set of glass doors set off to one 
     side.  The other nuns follow her.

                               VINCE
               She's heading for the lounge!  Go!

     Vince, Joey and Willy head for the lounge.

     Across the room, Eddie sees Christy and the cluster of 
     nuns head through the glass doors.  He barks into his 
     walkie-talkie.

                               EDDIE
               Move in -- now!

     INT. LOUNGE

     The lounge is deserted between shows, and all the lights 
     are out.  The mobsters enter with guns drawn.

                               JOEY
               I can't see anything in here!

                               VINCE
               Willy -- hit the lights.

                               WILLY
               Where?

                               VINCE
               Find 'em!

     Willy moves off to find the light switch.  There is a 
     flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs.

                               JOEY
               There!

               Before he can shoot, there is another 
               flash of fabric on the opposite side of 
               the room.

                               VINCE
                             (aiming)
               No -- there!

     And a third flash of fabric near the stage.

                               JOEY
               Over there!

     Willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly 
     brightly lit.  The mobsters blink for a moment, then find 
     all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find 
     an exit.

                               VINCE
               Freeze!  Everybody!

     Page 114.

     The nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy.

                               VINCE
               Joey?

                               JOEY
               Where is she?

     Christy steps forward, to the front of the stage.

                               CHRISTY
               Right here.  Let the others go -- they 
               have nothing to do with this.

                               VINCE
               Joey -- do it.

                               JOEY
               But, boss -- she's still, you know, a 
               nun.

                               VINCE
               She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some 
               broad!

     Mother Superior steps forward.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (with authority)
               I guarantee you, she is no broad.  She 
               is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. 
               Katherine's Convent.  She is a model of 
               generosity, virtue and love.  You have my 
               word, gentlemen.  She is a nun.

                               WILLY
               Hear that?  Now aren't you glad we 
               didn't shoot her?

     Vince has had enough.  Facing Christy, he raises the gun 
     and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches 
     away.  The nuns all recoil with horror.

     BLAM!  The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit.  She 
     blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive.  Instead, it's 
     Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his 
     shoulder.

     Across the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver. 
     The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence -- you're alive!

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (smiling)
               Christy.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (also smiling)
               Van Cartier.

                               CHRISTY
               You know?  About me?  About everything?

     Christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. She faces 
     Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Oh?

                               CHRISTY
               You saved my life.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I'm a Christian.

     Police pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and 
     Vince.  Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior.

                               EDDIE
               Don't you have a concert to go to?

                               CHRISTY
               That depends.  Sisters, you don't know 
               this, but Reverend Mother's been making 
               all sorts of noises about resigning. 
               That's bad news.  I don't know if we 
               could sing, if we thought that was true.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Not a note.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Impossible.

     Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she 
     has laryngitis.  All the other nuns imitate her.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Mother Superior)
               Then I guess you're stuck.  Life 
               sentence.  No parole.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Very well.
                             (she turns to Eddie)
               I hold you responsible for all of this, 
               For introducing a lounge act into my 
               convent.  For utterly disrupting our way 
               of life.  And for placing all of us in 
               mortal danger.
                             (sincerely, with a 
                             smile)
               Thank-you.

     ANGLE on Christy, watching this.  She grins.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. 
               Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So 
               you think, after all this, maybe I really 
               am a nun?

                               EDDIE
               I don't know.  There's only one way to 
               be absolutely sure.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like what?

     Eddie takes Christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss.  
     As they do so, Vince struggles toward Christy, as two cops 
     hold him back.  He is furious.

                               VINCE
               I was good to you! You re nothing but 
               no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit 
               Tramp!

                               CHRISTY
                             (staring at Vince, 
                             seeing him for the scum 
                             that he is)
               That used to be true, Vince.  I was with 
               you.  But something happened.  And I'm 
               different now.  Real--different.  I've 
               had, well, you might call it -- a 
               religious experience.  And I've got just 
               two words for you.  And those two words 
               are...

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (afraid Christy will 
                             curse)
               Mary Clarence!

                               CHRISTY
                             (grinning, to Vince)
               Bless you.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     People are pouring into the cathedral.  Among them we see 
     many Cardinals in their red uniforms.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     The choir has gathered together in a small room off the 
     main chapel.  They are putting finishing touches on their 
     choral robes, and are waiting nervously to go on.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (to Christy)
               I just realized -- this is the last time 
               we'll all be together.  We're going to 
               miss you so much.

     Page 117.

     Christy and Mary Patrick embrace.  Mary Patrick is 
     tearful.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey -- you re supposed to be the 
               cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel 
               like Snow White?

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (to Christy, with 
                             humor)
               You re okay -- for a civilian.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus embrace.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Reverend Mother?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Since Mary Clarence came to St. 
               Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped 
               by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer.  
               Is that enough experience yet?  For final 
               vows?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't think so.  What about skydiving?  
               A crank call to Billy Graham?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have evidenced great maturity, Mary 
               Robert.  We shall have a serious 
               discussion.

                               CHRISTY
               What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think 
               you were right.  I'm just a bad 
               influence.  Sister show biz.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... 
               a little Spandex.

                               CHRISTY
               Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and 
               women priests, and sleeping late?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Don't push it.

     Christy and Mother Superior embrace.

     INT. CHAPEL

     The chapel is packed to the rafters.  The first few rows 
     of pews are occupied by Cardinals.  Television cameras 
     glide up and down the aisles, angling for shots of the 
     altar.

     Page 118.

     The Choir stands together on the altar with Christy in 
     front. Behind them stands a much larger, all-city choir. 
     Christy gives the nod to Sister Alma, and the organ vamp 
     begins.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I WAS DOWNHEARTED

                               CHRISTY
               It's true!

                               MARY ROBERT
               I WAS HELL-BOUND, 
               YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
               SATAN WAS WAITING

                               CHRISTY
               Don't you know it!

                               MARY ROBERT
               BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME

                               CHRISTY
               What did He say?

                               MARY ROBERT
               HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!

                               MARY PATRICK
               MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER
               I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE

                               CHRISTY
               It's true -- I know her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE

                               CHRISTY
               What a shame!

                               MARY PATRICK
               BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL
               WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS

                               CHRISTY
               Pay attention...

                               MARY PATRICK
               SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!

                               CHRISTY
               Were you wicked?

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               Were you tempted?

                               CHOIR
               SING!
               SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!

     Page 119.

     In the front row, Mother Superior is trying to resist the 
     music.  She gives in, and starts bobbing her head to the 
     beat.  Beside her, Eddie looks very proud as his eyes meet 
     Christy's.

                               CHRISTY
               But I'm fearful!

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               And I'm tearful!

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE

                               CHRISTY/CHOIR
               DO YOUR TROUBLES BIND YOU
               IF YOO'RE DEEP IN WOE
               YOU CAN BANISH GLOOM IF YOU TRY
               FIND A SONG WITHIN YOU
               LET IT FILL YOUR DAYS
               JUST SING

                               MARY ROBERT
               SING!

                               CHOIR
               JUST SING!

                               MARY PATRICK
               SING!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               JUST SING!

                               CHRISTY
               Sing!

                               CHRISTY/CHOIR
               SING AND SAY DEVIL, GOODBYE!

     The entire congregation is ecstatic, as the song concludes 
     with a glorious final flourish.

                                                            April 1992                     

                         

                         1

          INT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAWN
          JOHN FLANDERS KITTREDGE and LOUISA KITTREDGE ("FLAN" and
          "OUISA") , an attractive couple in their 40s, in their night
          clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock.
          Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them.
          THEY survey their living room which under normal
          circumstances would appear to be a serene haven.
          But why are they-so aghast? And terrified?
          Has the apartment been violated?
          The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with
          the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is
          filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though
          the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern
          paintings hang on the walls.
          No. No visible disaster here.
          But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run
          between the hall and the living room.

                         OUISA
          Is anything gone?
          OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing
          leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there..

                         FLAW
          How can I look? I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          My god! The Kandinsky!
          0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the
          discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing.

                         OUISA Y
          It's gone! Call the police!

                         FLAN
          There it is!
          An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a
          Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and
          brilliantly colored.

                         0UISA
          Thank god!
          SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double
          sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in
          different styles on either side of the canvas.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2
          One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other
          side is all chaos and brilliant colors.
          OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it
          belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the
          geometric side. SHE admires it.
          FLAN opens the door from the hall into

          THE OFFICE.
          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with
          prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide
          projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers.
          OUISA appears in the doorway of the office.

                         OUISA
          We could've been killed.

                         FLAN
          Don't say that. The silver Victorian inkwell!
          FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room.
          OUISA follows HIM back into

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          FLAN looks on an antique table crowded with framed family
          photographs going way back in time and all kinds of
          mementoes.

                         OUISA
          How can you think of things? We could have been
          murdered.

                         FLAN
          I want to know if anything's gone?
          HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver
          beaver and looks at it with great objectivity..

                         FLAN
          There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why?
          OUISA, drained, looks out the window down onto Central Park.

                         OUISA
          Slashed ---our throats slashed.
          Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.
          Would we have-woken up?
          OUISA screams.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3
          But it's their pug dog licking her leg.
          OUISA picks up the dog and pets it.
          FLAN remembers something and buries his face in his hands.


                         FLAN
          We have to go to the wedding.

                         OUISA
          I am in no mood to go to any wedding.

                         FLAN
          We have to

                         OUISA
          They're your friends

                         FLAN
          I beg to differ. They're Your fr -
          FLAN stops, frightened suddenly, listening.

                         FLAN
          Hello?
          OUISA runs to HIM, terrified. HE holds HER.

                         OUISA (WHISPERS)
          You don't call out Hello unless--
          THEY walk softly to the dark hall.

                         FLAN
          I think we could tell if someone else was here.

                         OUISA
          We didn't all night.
          THEY look down the silent dark hall.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT THE WHITE WALL SOMEWHERE ELSE
          We don't know where we are yet but it's certainly not the
          KITTREDGE'S. The rain drumming outside and the distant
          thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this
          room with the white wall, wherever it is, claustrophobic,
          even erotic.
          A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and
          leans against this white wall. Right off, you say this
          YOUNG MAN is a winner.
          PAUL frowns, then smiles. Right into the camera.

                         PAUL

                         (SERIOUS)
          Hello.

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Hello.

                         (QUESTIONING)
          Hello?

                         (SUSPICIOUS)
          Hello...

                         (ELATED)
          Hello!
          Yes.
          Hello.
          SOMEONE OFF SCREEN claps.
          PAUL bows to the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE.

          EXT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING 910 FIFTH AVENUE DAY
          OUISA and FLAN run out of their apartment building, their
          clothes hastily pulled on, their faces swollen with shock.
          THEY run down the side street into

          THE GARAGE.
          Their car is waiting - a Mercedes - FLAN slips the
          attendant a bill. FLAN gets in the driver's seat.
          OUISA gets in the passenger seat.
          FLAN (a statement of fact)
          I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          Then I'll drive.

                         FLAN
          I have to hang on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5

                         T

                         OUISA
          Let's just get there

          INT THE WHITE WALL
          The Sound of the rain, the jazz, the thunder.

                         PAUL
          Bottle of beer.
          Bottle of beer.
          Bottle of beer.
          AN UNSEEN YOUNG MAN OFF CAMERA speaks - elegant phrasing.

                         VOICE
          Bottle of beer.

                         PAUL
          Bottle- of beer.

                         VOICE
          Very good. You owe me.
          PAUL takes off his shirt. HE's strongly built. HE throws

                         
          the shirt directly into the camera.

          EXT HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY DAY
          FLAN is driving terrifically fast. OUISA puts on a tape.
          MARIA CALLAS sings the death scene from La Traviata.

                         OUISA
          Be care - !
          A CAR veers by. FLAN swerves his car.

                         OUISA
          Let me drive!

                         FLAN (FURIOUS)
          Driving calms me!

                         OUISA
          When you're in one of these moods you do not
          drive well and I do not want to be killed today.

                         FLAN
          We could have been killed last night.

                         OUISA
          Stop saying that!

                         6

          !
          FLAN pulls himself together. HE moves over to the Slow lane.

                         FLAN
          I'm driving slowly. See. Slowly.

                         OUISA
          I went in the room first.
          FLAN looks for signs.

                         FLAN
          Where's the goddam turnoff onto the Taconic?
          A truck veers and almost hits them.

                         OUISA
          You didn't see what I saw!
          FLAN puts on brakes.

                         FLAN
          It's that fucking Maria Callas!
          Turn that damn thing off!

                         
          FLAN snaps off the tape deck.
          THEY resume driving.

                         OUISA
          It's not Maria Callas. It's that truck and you.

                         FLAN
          And last night.
          THE COUNTRYSIDE speeds by.

          EXT ST PETER'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH LITHGOW, NEW YORK DAY
          LOTS OF CARS parked in front of this sweet rural wooden
          chapel near Millbrook, New York.
          THE BRIDE, 20s, gets out of a limo escorted by her FATHER.
          OUISA and FLAN run up to the BRIDE and kiss her.

                         OUISA
          Happy is the bride the sun shines on

                         BRIDE (ALARMED)
          You look horrible!

                         OUISA (BRIGHT)
          No no! Could've been killed. All fine!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         7

                         

                         FATHER
          What?

                         FLAN
          Wonderful wedding. Wonderful day.
          THEY run into

          THE CHAPEL.
          This.perfect country chapel with a dozen or so rows of pews
          is bedecked with flowers and lit by candles.
          A STRING QUARTET at the side of the little altar plays
          Dvorak's American Quartet.
          THE USHER in morning clothes, greets FLAN and OUISA and
          shows them to their pew.

                         USHER
          Bride's side? Groom's side.

                         FLAN
          Either side. I can't even remember
          how we met them. Why are we here?
           THEY walk down the aisle, heads down.

                         OUISA
          Do not make a scene.
          THEY kneel.

                         FLAN (WHISPER)
          Now I lay me down to sleep - the most
          terrifying words  just think of it -

                         OUISA(WHISPER)
          I pray the Lord my soul to keep-

                         FLAN (WHISPER)
          The nightmare part - If I should
          die before I wake -

                         OUISA(WHISPER)
          If I should die - I pray the Lord
          my soul to take -
          COUPLE IN THE PEW IN FRONT turn. A
          MAN, A WOMAN, strangely not unlike FLAN and OUISA, perhaps A
          few years older, perhaps more nautical as if they'd flown a
          in from Nantucket, are named SANDY and CONNIE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SANDY
          Is anything wrong?

                         OUISA
          We were almost murdered

                         FLAN

                         THROATS SLASHED
          THE PEOPLE in the pew in front gasp.
          FLAN and OUISA are serious.
          THE QUARTET plays The Wedding March.
          EVERYONE stands.
          THE BRIDE and her FATHER walk down the aisle.
          CU OUISA'S FACE lost in thought.
          Bright vivid colors fill the screen. Later we will learn
          they are from a double-sided painting by Kandinsky, which

                         HANGS IN

          THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM.

                         OUISA (VO)

                         
          Chaos.
          OUISA'S face appears briefly, smiling, then is replaced by
          dark, geometric patterns. The other side of the painting.
          It is lowered to reveal OUISA very serious.

                         OUISA (VO)
          Control.
          (The painting is flipped.)
          Chaos.
          (OUISA smiles. Flips it again. Frowns.)
          Control.

          BACK IN THE CHAPEL
          OUISA, still frowning at her memory, realizes the wedding
          ceremony is over.
          THE BRIDE and the GROOM run up the aisle beaming at EVERYONE
          to the strains of Lohengrin.
          But even THEY slow down when THEY see the state FLAN and
          OUISA are in.

                         GROOM
          Is everything all
          FLAN snaps out of it, putting on his party smile.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         FLAN
          We always get this way at weddings.
          THE BRIDE and GROOM resume their run up the aisle.
          It's FLAN and OUISA's turn to leave the pew and go up the
          aisle. SHE is stricken.

                         OUISA
          I do not always get this way at weddings.

                         FLAN
          We're alive.
          THEY walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel.
          SHE puts her head into his shoulder.

                         OUISA
          Oh, it was awful awful awful awful.
          Then OUISA and FLAN put on their best smiles as THEY pass
          through a receiving line, finally shaking hands with the

          WEDDING COUPLE.

                         BRIDE

                         
          Did you say you could have been killed?

                         OUISA (MERRY)
          Yes! Only hours ago!

                         FLAN (MERRY)
          But we're here!

                         OUISA
          Wouldn't miss it!
          THE BRIDE and GROOM look after THEM.

          EXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY
          A spankingly bright and solid country club in Millbrook New
          York situated on the golf course grounds surrounded by lots
          of tennis courts.

          INT MILLBROOK CLUB DAY
          THE WEDDING GUESTS file into the cheery club, all bright
          white and a shade of cheery green that only country clubs
          seem to find.
          MORE GUESTS than could f it into the CHAPEL are here in the
          club waiting for the Bride and Groom.
          FLAN and OUISA hesitate before going into the ballroom.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         10
          THEY stop in the small quiet dark clubby BAR.
          THEY sit at a small table, pulling themselves together.
          SANDY and CONNIE (the people from the pew in front of them)
          come up to THEM. A WOMAN who looks like a dormouse is with
          them. SHE is named JULIA.

                         SANDY
          We hate to pry -

                         FLAN
          No no. You're not prying

                         CONNIE
          But what happened -

                         SANDY
          This is our friend Julia

                         FLAN
          Do we know each other?

                         JULIA
          Oh yes through...

                         9 FLAN
          Of course. Haven't seen them in years
          FLAN shakes hands with the new acquaintance.

                         CONNIE
          We're worried for you
          FLAN and OUISA look at each other.

                         OUISA
          Tell them!
          SANDY and CONNIE and JULIA sit down at the small table.

                         FLAN
          We were having a wonderful evening last night.

                         OUISA
          A friend we hadn't seen for many years came by
           for dinner. I don't think you know him -

                         FLAN (PORTENTOUSLY)
          Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa--

                         OUISA
          Don't say it so portentously.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         11

                         

                         FLAN (BRIGHT)
          Geoffrey from South Africa.

                         OUISA
          Don't be ga-ga.
          (THEY give their orders to THE BARTENDER.)
          Something large.

                         SANDY
          I didn't know Geoffrey was in town.

                         JULIA
          I saw him at Susie Baxter's

                         SANDY
          I wasn't at Susie Baxter's

                         CONNIE
          Sandy forgets he was married to Susie Baxter.
          THE WAITER goes.

                         SAVOY
          That's no reason why she can't
          invite me to a party.
          CONNIE whispers to JULIA, her eyes on FLAN.

                         CONNIE
          He's an art dealer.
          JULIA nods now that's she's remembered.
          FLAN (hears it)
          Private sales. Purchases.
          OUISA leans forward. Somehow the telling calms HER.
          THE CHUMS lean forward.

                         OUISA
          We knew Geoffrey

                         FLAN
          through our children when Geoffrey and his
          family all lived in New York.

                         OUISA
          They've moved back to South Africa.

                         FLAN
          He was here in New York briefly on business
          and asked us to ask him for dinner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         12

                         OUISA
          He's King Midas rich. Literally. Gold mines.
          THE WAITER puts down the tray of drinks.

                         FLAN
          Seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine.

                         OUISA
          But he is always short of cash because his
          government won't let its people --

                         FLAN
          Its white people --

                         OUISA
          -- its white people take out any money. So it's
          like taking in a War Baby.

                         (TO WAITER)
          Thank you. That one's mine -
          THEY switch drinks.

                         FLAN
           When he called it was like a bolt from the blue
          as I had a deal coming up and was short by

                         OUISA

                         TWO MILLION
          FLAN puts down his drink.

                         FLAN
          The figure is superfluous
          OUISA turns to CONNIE.

                         OUISA
          I hate when he uses the word "superfluous". I
          mean, we needed two million and we hadn't seen
          Geoffrey in a long time and while Geoffrey might
          not have the price of a dinner he easily might
          have two million dollars.

                         FLAN
          The currents last night were very churny.

                         CUISA
          we weren't sucking up. We like Geoffrey.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         13

                         FLAN
          It's that awful thing of having truly
          rich folk for friends.

                         OUISA
          Face it. The money does get in the -

                         FLAN
          Only if you let it. The fact of the money
          shouldn't get in-

                         OUISA
          Having a rich friend is like drowning and your
          friend makes life boats. But the friend gets
          very touchy if you say one word: life boat.
          (THE CHUMS laugh.)
          Well, that's two words. We were afraid our
          South African friend might say "You only love me
          for my. life boats?" But we like Geoffrey.

                         CONNIE
          I know who he is now.

                         JULIA
           Lovely man.

                         X

                         SANDY
          Didn't he invite us to visit him?

                         FLAN
          It wasn't a life-threatening evening.

                         OUISA -
          Rich people can do something for you even if
          you're not sure what it is`you want them to do.
          THEY turn at the sound of applause.
          THE BRIDE and GROOM have entered the Country Club and our
          table in the bar looks up as THE WEDDING PARTY passes by for
          a moment rushing past the Bar into the ballroom.
          Off in the ballroom THE SMALL ORCHESTRA strikes up "Just One
          Of Those Things" for the ten thousandth time.
          EVERYONE in the club is applauding and OUR TABLE applauds
          too. OUISA starts to rise.

                         OUISA
          Should we?

                         CONNIE
          Not on your life.
          CONNIE pulls OUISA back down to the table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         14

                         
          FLAN signals another round.

                         FLAN
          Hardly a Life Boat evening -
          OUISA sits, enjoying this.

                         OUISA (SING-SONG)
          Portentous.

                         FLAN
          But when Geoffrey called and asked us to take
          him for dinner, he made a sudden pattern in
          life's little tea leaves because who wants to
          go to banks?
          FLAN'S VOICE takes us back to last night

          INT THE KITTREDGE.'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT

                         FLAN (VO)
          Geoffrey called and our tempests settled
          into showers and life was manageable. What
          more can you want?

                         
          GEOFFREY stands up into the frame, an elegant, impeccably
          British South African, more English than the English, ten
          years older than Ouisa and Flan.
          FLAN and OUISA are both dressed very stylishly and nattily
          tonight. But not trendy, not so it shows.
          FLAN was definitely an athlete and he still keeps himself in
          trim. If HE's in the art world, there's nothing arty about
          him.

                         GEOFFREY
          Listen.
          OUISA stops doing what she's doing which is rolling out a
          drink trolley with little hors d'oeuvres on plates.
          FLAN stops doing what he's doing which is checking that a
          slide projector is in place on the desk along side the
          silver beaver inkwell.
          FLAN and OUISA both tense.

                         FLAN
          What's wrong?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15

                         GEOFFREY
          It always amazes me when New York is so quiet.
          OUISA and FLAN relax and laugh.

                         OUISA
          With the kids away, we get used to a lower noise
          quotient.
          FLAN pours a drink for GEOFFREY.

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey, you have to move out of
          South Africa. You'll be killed.
          Why do you stay in South Africa?

                         GEOFFREY
          One has to stay there to educate the black
          workers and we'll know we've been successful
          when they kill us.

                         FLAN
          Planning the revolution that will destroy you.

                         
          OUISA sits back on the comfy sofa amazed at the thought.

                         OUISA
          Putting your life on the line.

                         GEOFFREY
          You don't think of it like that.
          I wish you'd come visit.
          OUISA takes her drink and strokes the ears of her dog.

                         OUISA
          But we'd visit you and sit in your gorgeous
          house planning trips into the townships
           demanding to see the poorest of the poor. "Are
           you sure they're the worst off? I mean, we've
           come all this way. We don't want to see people
          just mildly victimized by apartheid. We demand
          shock." It doesn't seem right sitting on the
          East Side talking about revolution.

                         FLAN
          Only small murky cafes for Pepe le Noko here.

                         OUISA
          No. La Passionaria. I will come to
          South Africa and build barricades and
          lean against them, singing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         16

                         FLAN
          And the people would follow.

                         OUISA
          "Follow Follow Follow". What's that song?

                         FLAN
          The way Gorbachev cheered on the striking coal
          miners in the Ukraine - yes, you must strike-
          it is your role in history to dismantle this
          system. Russia and Poland - you can't believe
          the developments in the world -
           (HE remembers:) "The Fantasticks" (SINGS:)
          "Follow Follow Follow".

                          OUISA
          China.
          FLAN and OUISA (despair)
          Oh.

                         GEOFFREY
          Oy vay China. As my grandmother would say.
          Our role in history. And we offer ourselves up

                         
          to it.

                         FLAN
          That is your role in history. Not our role.
          OUISA ponders this thought.

                         OUISA
          A role in history. To say that so easily.
          GEOFFREY suddenly gets up and looks through the telescope by
          the window.

                         GEOFFREY'S POV
          GEOFFREY flashes down nine floors into Central Park. HE
          frowns in puzzlement when HE sees

          A STATUE OF AN ALASKAN HUSKY
          baying up into the sky.
          FLAN and OUISA look at GEOFFREY's back and then at each
          other. How to keep the ball rolling?
          FLAN (to Geoffrey)
          Do you want another drink before we--

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         17

                         
          GEOFFREY turns into the room.

                         GEOFFREY
          Wonderful view.

                         OUISA
          The phrase - striking coal miners - I see all
           these very striking coal miners modelling the
          fall fashions.

                         GEOFFREY
          Where should we?

                         FLAN
          There's good Szechuan. And Hunan.

                         OUISA
          The sign painter screwed up the sign. Instead
          of The Hunan Wok, he painted The Human Wok.

                         GEOFFREY
          God! The restaurants! New York has become the
          Florence of the Sixteenth Century. Genius on
          every corner.

                         OUISA
          I don't think genius has kissed the Human Wok.
          THEY finish off their drinks.

                         GEOFFREY
          The new Italian looked cheery.
          FLAN and OUISA
          Good.

                         FLAN
          We made reservations.
          FLAN looks at the slide projector.

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey, I'd like to show -
          FLAN'S sentence hangs in mid-air as GEOFFREY follows OUISA

                         INTO

          THE HALL.
          OUISA burrows in the closet getting her coat and
          GEOFFREY's coat out of the hall closet stuffed with tennis
          rackets and skis and boots.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         18

                         

                         OUISA
          This restaurant - they wrap ravioli up
          like salt water taffy.
          FLAN appears behind HER to help HER.
          THEY both wrestle the coats out of the closet.

                         FLAN
          Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars.
          And FLAN gets the coats. A clatter of tennis rackets
          falling. GEOFFREY takes his topcoat.

                         GEOFFREY
          You have to come to South Africa so
          I can pay you back. I'll take you on my plane
          into the Okavango Swamps -

                         OUISA
          Did you hear - to take back to Johannesburg.
          out in Eastharpton

                         FLAN

                         LAST WEEKEND

                         OUISA
          a guy goes into one of the better food stores -

                         FLAN
          Dean and DeLuca -
          FLAN helps OUISA on with her coat.

                         OUISA
          one of the Dean and DeLuca look alikes. Gets a
          pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar. Goes
          up front. Sees there's a line at the register.
          Slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out.
          GEOFFREY doesn't get the anecdote.

                         FLAN
          We sent it to the Times.
          GEOFFREY smiles politely.
          FLAN and OUISA press a little bit too hard.

                         OUISA
          They have the joke page of things
          around New York.

                         IV

                         FLAN
          They send you a bottle of champagne.
          THEY all laugh brightly.

          INT MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          THE CHUMS listen enrapt. OUISA is serious.

                         OUISA
          We weren't auditioning but I kept thinking Two
          Million dollars Two Million dollars.

                         FLAN
          It's like when people say -Don't think about
          elephants' and all you can think about is
          elephants elephants elephants.

                         OUISA
          Two million dollars Two million dollars.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
           OUISA and FLAN laugh brightly. THE FRONT DOORBELL rings.
           OUISA and FLAN look at each other. Who is that?
          OUISA goes into the hall.

                         OUISA
          What ever you do, don't think about elephants.

                         GEOFFREY
          Elephants?
          FLAN rapidly steers GEOFFREY to a chair, closes the living
          room door, then wheels a projector with a carousel tray into
          place.

                         FLAN
          Louisa is a dada manifesto. About the Cezanne -
          unless we're careful, it'll be sold and never
          seen again -
          FLAN switches off the room's lights and clicks on the
          projector. The slide projection of a beautiful green
          landscape by Cezanne fills the wall by the door.

                         FLAN
          Mid-period. Landscape of a dark green forest.
          In the far distance you see the sunlight. One
          of his first uses of a pale color being forced
          to carry the weight of the picture. The
          experiment that would pay of f in the apples. A
          burst of color asked to carry so much-- The
          Japanese don't like anything about it except
          it's a Cezanne--
          And suddenly the door in the wall opens up.
          A YOUNG BLACK MAN supported by the ELEVATOR MAN, (EDDIE)
          appears in the Cezanne forest holding his eyes against the
          projector's light. And OUISA behind HIM.
          FLAN clicks off the projector.
          OUISA switches on the living room lights.
          THE YOUNG BLACK MAN - PAUL - is in his early twenties, very
          handsome, very preppy. His shirt front is ripped and
          bloodied. Fresh blood. EDDIE helps PAUL to the sofa,
          OUISA following at a loss.

                          PAUL
           I'm so sorry to bother you, but I've been hurt-
           and I've lost everything and I didn't know where
           to go. Your children-- I'm a friend of --

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          THE CHUMS are transfixed.

                         OUISA
          And he mentioned our childrens' names.

                         FLAN
          And the school where they went.

                         OUISA
          Harvard. You can say Harvard.

                         FLAN
          We don't want to get into libel.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
          PAUL (exhausted and scared)
          I was mugged. Out there. In Central Park. By
          the statue of that Alaskan husky. I was
          standing there trying to figure out why there is
          a statue of a dog who saved lives in the Yukon
          in Central 'Park and I was standing there trying
          to puzzle it out when -

                         OUISA
          Are you okay?

                         PAUL
          They took my money and my brief case. I said my
          thesis is in there -
          PAUL looks down. HE sees the blood seeping through his
          shirt.

                         FLAN
          His shirt's bleeding.

                         OUISA
          His shirt is not bleeding. He's bleeding.
          PAUL holds his mouth, nauseous.

                         PAUL
          I get this way around blood.
          FLAN (leading PAUL out of the room)
          Not on the rug. Eddie, get the doctor--
           EDDIE turns to leave.

                          PAUL
           No! I'll survive. Please. No doctors -
           PAUL, frightened, looks at FLAN.
           FLAN (To EDDIE)
           We'll call if we need any -
          FLAN helps PAUL out of the room down the hall.

                         OUISA
          Thank you, Eddie -
          EDDIE goes.
          FLAN, followed by OUISA, supports PAUL into

          THE WHITE TILED BATHROOM.
          PAUL sits on the side of the tub.
          PAUL takes off his blazer and pulls off his ripped shirt.
          His tie is still around his neck. There is a good sized
           knife slash in his side by his rib cage. OUISA and FLAN
          cringe. FLAN opens the medicine cabinet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         22

                         PAUL
          I don't mind the money. But in this age of
          mechanical reproduction they managed to get the
          only copy of my thesis.

                         FLAN
          Where's the first aid book!
          OUISA runs into their bedroom.
          PAUL looks out the bathroom door into FLAN and OUISA'S
          bedroom. PAUL watches OUISA as she goes into

          THE MASTER BEDROOM.
          OUISA rummages through her book case and finds her Red
          Cross manual. OUISA turns and sees PAUL sitting on the edge
          of the tub staring at HER.
          FLAN is crouched down, bathing PAUL'S slash.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          OUISA is moved by these events.

                         OUISA
           We bathed him. We did First Aid.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S BATHROOM
          OUISA reads from the manual.

                         OUISA
          The Red Cross advises: Press edges of the wound
          firmly together, wash area with water-

                         FLAN
          Yes! I'm doing that - Hold on
          FLAN daubs on mercurochrome.

                         PAUL
          Owww!

                         FLAN
          Hold still! Ouisa! I need gauze!
          GEOFFREY pokes his head in the bathroom.

                         GEOFFREY (LEAVING)
          It's been wonderful seeing you--

          OUISA (firm but cheery)
          No no no! Stay!

                         GEOFFREY
          My time is so short. Before I leave America, I
          really should call -

                         OUISA
          You darling old poop -

                         FLAN
          Have you seen the new book on Cezanne?

                         GEOFFREY

                         NO

                         OUISA
          An absolute revelation - this'll only take a mo-
          OUISA rushes out of the bathroom after GEOFFREY.

                         FLAN
          I need the gauze

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          I ran down the hall to get the book on Cezanne,
          got the gauze from my bathroom--

          BACK AT THE KITTREDGE'S
          We watch a flustered OUSIA dart about as she describes--

                         OUISA (VO)
          Gave the Cezanne to Flan who wanted the gauze,
          gave the gauze to Geoffrey who wanted Cezanne.
          OUISA mutters under her breath as she dashes down

          THE HALL.

          ouisa?
          OUISA grabs the gauze out of GEOFFREY's hand.
          SHE runs back down the HALL.

          FLAN finishes bandaging PAUL's wound.
          OUISA goes into

          HER SON'S BEDROOM.,
          SHE takes a pink shirt from the bureau.

          THE MASTER BEDROOM
          PAUL puts on the pink shirt and looks at HIMSELF in the
          mirror.

                         FLAN
          He's going to be fine.
          GEOFFREY appears in the door with the book on Cezanne.

                         GEOFFREY
          Lovely book.
          FLAN looks stricken.

                         OUISA
          Please? Stay?
          GEOFFREY pauses.

                         GEOFFREY
          Agreed.
          FLAN beams.

          BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM
          FLAN holds out PAUL's blazer. PAUL winces as HE lifts his
          arms to put it on.

                         PAUL
          Your children said you were kind. All the kids
          were sitting around the dorm one night dishing
          the- shit out of their parents. But your kids
          were silent and said No, not our parents. Not
          Flan and Ouisa. Not the Kittredges. The
          Kittredges are kind. So after the muggers left,
          I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue
          apartments. Mrs. Onassis lives there. I know
          the Babcocks live over there. The Auchinclosses
          live there. But you lived here. I came here.
          OUISA, so touched, turns to FLAN and GEOFFREY.

                         OUISA
          Can you believe what the kids said?
          PAUL looks at the framed photos on wall of

          0 THE HALL.

                          PAUL
           But your kids - I love them. Talbot and Woody
           mean the world to me.

                         FLAN
          He lets you call him Woody? Nobody's
          called him Woody in years.
          THEY come into

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          PAUL looks around happily. HE goes to the wall by the
          mantlepiece and looks at a dark abstract painting.

                         PAUL
           They described this apartment in detail. This
          is a Kandinsky! - a double. One painted on
          either side. May I see - ?
          OUISA lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around.
          Even GEOFFREY is taken by the painting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         0 26

                         FLAN
          What makes it valuable is Kandinsky painted on
          either side of the canvas in two wildly
          different styles. One side is geometric and
          somr=r. The other side is wild and vivid.

                         GEOFFREY
          My god!

                         FLAN
          We flip it around for variety.
          OUISA happily turns the painting back and forth to show off
          its two sides. The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors
          then the dark colors.

                         OUISA
          You like? You like? Chaos? Control?
          Chaos? Control?
          SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a
          dopey tragic face for the geometric. Yes. We've been here
          before, through OUISA's memory, at the wedding.

                         PAUL
          It's wonderful.
          OUISA leans the painting against a chair, the chaotic side
          showing.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          FLAN turns to JULIA.

                         FLAN
          Wassily Kandinsky. Born 1866 Moscow. Blue
          Rider Exhibition 1914. He said "It is clear
          that the choice of object that is one of the
          elements in the harmony of form must be decided
          only by a corresponding vibration in the human
          soul". (very spiritual) Died 1944 France.
          JULIA nods. Ah yes.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM
          PAUL looks around the apartment, so cozy, warm.

                         PAUL
          It's the way they said it would be.

          Did you bitch your parents?

                         PAUL
          As a matter of fact. No. Your kids and I...we
          both liked our parents... loved our--Look, am I
          getting in the way? I burst in here,
          hysterical. Blood. I didn't mean to---

          Well, fine. It's just there. Everyone's in a
          constant state of luxurious despair and constant
          discovery and paralysis.

          What's he directing?

          Cats.

          Well, yes. Years ago.

                         FLAN
          Surely they can't make the movie of Cats.

                         OUISA
          Of course they can.

                         PAUL

          They thought of lots of ways to go. Animation.

          But he found a better way. As a matter of fact,
          he turned it down at first. He went to tell
          the producers - as a courtesy - all the reasons
          why you couldn't make a movie of Cats and in
          going through all the reasons why you couldn't
          make a movie of Cats, he suddenly saw how you
          could make a movie of Cats --

          Can it be possible? A FEW MORE GUESTS have joined the table.

          slightly - pulled up closer--

                         FLAN
          And he told us.

          He named the greatest black star in movies.

          Don't say it. We're trying to keep this

          INT THE WHITE WALL
          PAUL, leaning against the wall, talks with great vivacity to
          that OFF SCREEN PRESENCE who is the POV of the camera.

                         PAUL
          Sidney Poitier, the future Jackie Robinson of
          films, was born the twenty fourth of February
          1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to
          Florida - legally? -to sell tomatoes they had
          grown on their farm in the Bahamas. He grew up
          on Cat Island, "so poor they didn't even own
          dirt" he has said. Neglected by his family, my
          father would sit on the shore, and, as he told
          me many times, "conjure up the kind of worlds
          that were on the other side and what I'd do in
           them." He arrived in New York City from the
           Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and
           a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus
           station across from the old Madison Square
           Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue. He moved
           to the roof of the Brill building, commonly
           known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the
           Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night. He taught
          0 himself to read by reading the newspaper. In the
           Black newspaper, the theater page was opposite
           the Want Ad page. Among his 42 films are No Way
           Out 1950/ Cry the Beloved Country 1952/
           Blackboard Jungle 1955/ The Defiant Ones 1958/
           Raisin in the Sun 1961/ Lilies of the Field
           1963/ In the Heat of the Night 1967/ To Sir With
           Love 1967/ Shoot to Kill 1988 and, of course,

           PAUSE. (THE OFF SCREEN VOICE JOINS HIM)
          Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.

                         PAUL (LAUGHS)
          He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and
          was twice named top male box-office star in
          the country. My father made no films from 1977
          to 1987 but worked as director and author. Dad
          said to me once "I still don't fully understand
          how all that came about in the sequence it came
          about".
          And we hear the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE applauding.
          PAUL bows, happily.
          HE kicks his shoe off into the camera.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         PAUL
          Dad's not in till tomorrow at the Sherry. I
          came down from Cambridge. Thought I'd stay at
          some fleabag for adventure. Orwell. Down and
          Out. I really don't know New York. I know Rome
          and Paris and Los Angeles a lot better.

                         OUISA
          We're-going out to dinner. You'll come.

                         PAUL
          Out to dinner?

                         FLAN
          Out to dinner.

                         PAUL
          But why go out to dinner?

                         OUISA
          Because we have reservations and oh my god'what
          time is it? Have we lost the reservations and
           we don't have a damn thing in the house and it's
          Sixteenth century Florence and there's genius on
          every block.

                         GEOFFREY
          Don't mock.
          SHE kisses GEOFFREY.

                         PAUL
          You must have something in the fridge.

                         FLAN
          A frozen steak from the Ice Age.

                         PAUL
          Why spend a hundred dollars on a bowl of rice?
          Let me into the kitchen. Cooking calms me. What
          I'd like to do is calm down, pay back your kids-

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          He mentioned our kids names--

          FLAN turns to a NEWCOMER.

                         FLAN
          Two. Two at Harvard. A daughter at Groton.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         PAUL
          - who've been wonderful to me.

                         OUISA
          They've never mentioned you.

                         FLAN
          What are they supposed to say? We've become
          friends with the son of Sidney Poitier, barrier
          breaker of the fifties and sixties?

                         GEOFFREY
          Your father means a great deal in South Africa.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          Even Geoffrey was touched.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         PAUL
          I'm glad of that. Dad and I went to Russia once
          to a film festival and he was truly amazed how
          much his presence meant -

                         OUISA
          Oh no! Tell us stories of movie stars tying up
          their children and being cruel.

                         PAUL
          I wish.

                         GEOFFREY
          You wish?

                         PAUL
          If I wanted to write a book about him. I really
          can't. No one would want to read it. He's
          decent. I admire him.

                         OUISA
          He's married to an actress who was in one of--
          she's white? Am I right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         33

                         
          PAUL (painful territory)
          That is not my mother. That is his
          second wife. He met Joanna making
          "The Lost Man". He left my mother
          who had stuck by him in the lean years.
          X had just been born. "The Lost Man"
          is the only film of my father's I can't
          bring myself to see.

                         OUISA
           Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to -

                          PAUL (BRIGHT)
          No! We're all good friends now. . His kids from
          that marriage. Us - the old kids. I'd love to
          get in that kitchen.
          FLAN (to Ouisa)
          What should we do?

                         OUISA
          It's Geoffrey's only night in New York.

                         GEOFFREY
           I vote - stay in.
          OUISA, FLAN and PAUL
          Good!

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          We moved.into the kitchen.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S KITCHEN
          THE KITCHEN is large, was built in the 205 when people had
          big dinners at home.
          PAUL opens the refrigerators and freezers.
          PAUL'S actions are synchronous with the words.

                         FLAN (VO)
          We watched him cook.

                         OUISA (VO)
          We watched him cook and chop.

                         FLAN (VO)
          He sort of did wizardry

                         OUISA (VO)
          An old jar of sun dried tomatoes--

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         34

           FLAN (VO)
           Left avers - tuna fish - olives - onions -
          It's all dazzling and rapid. FLAN opens the wine. OUISA
          takes dishes and silver out and hands them to GEOFFREY.
          EVERYONE is in a picnic spirit. PAUL fills a large pot with
          water from the tap.
          PAUL (to Geoffrey)

                         YOU'RE FROM

                         GEOFFREY
          Johannesburg.
          PAUSE. PAUL Studies GEOFFREY. OUISA and FLAN freeze.
          Is it a tense moment?
          PAUL takes a breath. PAUL puts the water on the fire, eyes
          never off GEOFFREY. Then PAUL resumes chopping onions
          briskly and dropping them into the frying pan.

                         PAUL
          My dad took me to a movie shot in South Africa.
          The camera moved from this vile rioting in the

                         
          streets to a villa where people picked at lunch
          on a terrace, the only riot the flowers and the
          birds-- gorgeous plumage and petals. And I
          didn't understand. And Dad said to me "You meet
          these young blacks who are having a terrible
          time. They've had a totally inadequate
          education and yet in '76 - the year of the
          Soweto riots - they took on a tremendous
          political responsibility. It just makes you
          wonder at the maturity that is in them."
          PAUL opens a cabinet and takes out a Haitian candelabra that
          obviously hasn't been used since it was brought home as a
          souvenir. PAUL dusts it off.

                         PAUL
          it makes you realize that the 'crummy childhood'
          theory, that everything can be blamed in a
          Freudian fashion on the fact that you've had a
          bad upbringing, just doesn't hold water. May I?

                         FLAN
          Oh, please.
          PAUL pours a brandy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         35

                         

                         GEOFFREY
          What about being black in America?
          PAUL scoops a melange of vegetables into a glass dish and
          puts it in the microwave.

                         PAUL
          My problem is I've never felt American.
          I grew up in Switzerland. Boarding school.
          Villa Rosey.

                         OUISA
          There is a boarding school in Switzerland that
          takes you at age eighteen months.

                         PAUL
          That's not me. I've never felt people liked me
          for my connections. Movie star kid problems.
          None of those.
          THE WATER boils. HE dumps in pasta.
          The microwave timer goes off. PAUL removes the glass dish.

                         PAUL
          But I never knew I was black in that racist way
          0 till I was sixteen and came back here. Very
          protected. White servants. After the divorce we
          moved to Switzerland. My mother, brother and Z.
          I don't feel American. I don't even feel black.
          I suppose that's very lucky for me even though
          Freud says there's no such thing as luck. Just
          what you make.
          PAUL takes the pasta off the boil and drains it, plopping
          the pasta into a brightly colored bowl.
          OUISA, FLAN and GEOFFREY sit at the counter, transfixed.

                         OUISA
          Does Freud say that?
          PAUL holds out three dishes heaped with food.

                         PAUL
          Here's dinner. All ready.

                         OUISA
          Shall we move into the dining room?
          OUISA opens double doors leading into

          THE DINING ROOM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         36
          This room has not been in use for a while.
          The overhead chandelier is very bright and harsh.
          A sewing machine is in the corner there.
          Bookkeeping items at one end of the long table.
          Nineteenth century Victorian mythological paintings hang.on
          the walls. FLAN adjusts the rheostat to dim the lights in
          the chandelier.

                         OUISA
          Don't look at the sewing machine.
          FLAN sweeps the bill things off the table onto a chair.
          OUISA opens the sideboard and takes out four linen place
          mats and silverware and quickly sets the table.
          PAUL takes out matches and lights the Haitian card"e'Yabra.
          FLAN runs into the living room and returns with a vase of
          flowers.
          THEY smile at the appearance of the sudden party in this
          wonderful room.
          THEY sit down. THEY eat. Surprise. It's delicious.

                          PAUL
          Is everything okay?
          FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY
          Mmrmmm .. yes.

                         GEOFFREY
          This is the best pasta I've ever -

                         OUISA
          The best!

                         PAUL
          My father insisted we learn to cook.

                         FLAN
          Isn't he from Jamaica? There's a taste of--

                         GEOFFREY
          The islands.

                         PAUL
          Yes. Before he made it, he ran four restaurants
          in Harlem. You have good buds!

                         GEOFFREY
          See? Good buds. I've never been
          complimented on my buds-

                         R

                         FLAN
          I am astonished!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         37
          PAUL leans back and watches them happily.

                         OUISA
          Where's yours?

                         PAUL
          The cook never eats.

                         FLAN
          The more for us!
          THEY all laugh.
          PAUL leaves the room abruptly.
          FLAN, OUISA and GEOFFREY look at each other.
          FLAN stands.

                         FLAN
          Hello?
          PAUL returns with the rest of the real in brightly painted
          bowls.

                         

                         PAUL
          Seconds?
          THEY laugh and are served.

                         OUISA
          Have you declared your major yet?

                         PAUL
          You're like all parents. What's your major?

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey, Harvard has all those great titles the
          students give courses.

                         OUISA
          The Holocaust and Ethics?

                         FLAN
          Krauts and Doubts.

                         OUISA
          I think we're lucky having this dinner. Isn't
          this the finest time? A toast to you.

                         GEOFFREY
          To Cats!

                         FLAN
          Blunt question. What's he like?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         38
          OUISA reaches for the bottle of wine.

                         OUISA
          Let's not be star fuckers.

                         FLAN
          I'm not a star fucker.

                         PAUL
          My father, being an actor, has no real identity.
          You say to him, Pop, what's new? And he says,
          'I got an interesting script today. I was asked
          to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon. Now, I've
          been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell
          apart. My wife says we have to get mbney to get
          through this winter. And I sign up as part of
          this team where all my beliefs are challenged.
          But I hold firm. In spite of prejudice because
          I want to get back to my wife. Out of this
          forest,back to the church... .' And my father is
          in tears and I say Pop, this i:. not a real
           event, this is some script that was sent to
          you. And my father says ' I' m trying it out to
          see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he
          has no memory--only the scripts producers send
          him in the mail through his agents. That's his
          past.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          Can it be? The CROWD listening to FLAN and OUISA is even
          larger.

                         OUISA
          I just loved the kid so much. I wanted to reach
          out to him.

                         FLAN
          And then we asked him what his thesis was on.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S DINING ROOM

                         GEOFFREY
          The one that was stolen. Please?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         39

                         PAUL
          Well...
          (HE takes a deep breath and leans back in

                         HIS CHAIR)
          A substitute teacher out on Long Island was
          dropped from his job for fighting with a
          student. A few weeks later, the teacher
          returned to the classroom, shot the student
          unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then
          shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught my
          eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor
          described the teacher as a nice boy. Always
          reading Catcher In the Rye.
          The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said
          he did it because he wanted to-`draw the
          attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and
          the reading of that book would be his defense.
          And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan
          and his press secretary said if you want my
          defense all you have to do is read catcher in
          the Rye. It seemed to be time to read it again.

                         FLAN
          I haven't read it in years.
          OUISA shushes FLAN.

                         PAUL
          I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine
          because I wanted to see what she had underlined
          and I read this book to find out why this
          touching, beautiful, sensitive story published
          in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of
          hate.
          I started reading. : It's exactly as I
          remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: "My
          brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute."
          Page three: "what a phony slob his father was."
          Page nine: "People never notice anything."
          Then on page twenty two my hair stood up.
          Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive
          sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap.
          "A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of
          closed one eye like I was taking aim at it.
          This is a people shooting hat. I shoot people
          in this hat."

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         40

                         

                         PAUL (CONTINUES)
          Hmmm, I said. This book is preparing people for
          bigger moments in their lives than I ever
          dreamed of.
          Then on p. 89 "I'd rather push a guy out the
           window or chop his head off with an ax than sock
          him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what
          scares me most is the other guy's face..."
          I finished the book. It's a touching story,
          comic because the boy wants to do so much and
          can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only
          lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is
          only hateful, and is completely self involved.
          In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a
          male adolescent.
          FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed.
           And what alarms me about that book--not the book
           so much as the aura about it--is this: the book
           is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't
           function. And at the end before he can run
          away and start a new life, it starts to rain and
          he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing
          about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It
          may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett
          be the great modern theme.
          The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For
          Godot--"Let's go." "Yes, let's go." Stage
          directions: They do not move.
          But the aura around this book of Salinger's--
          which perhaps should be read by everyone ut
          young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun
          house mirror and amplifies like a distorted
          speaker one of the great tragedies of our times-
          --the death of the imagination.
          Because what else is paralysis?
          The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         42

                         PAUL (CONTINUES)
          The imagination has been so debased that
          imagination--being imaginative-- rather than
          being the lynch pin of our existence now stands
          as a synonym for something outside ourselves
          like Science fiction or some new use for
          tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an
          imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So
          imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And
          Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so

                         IMAGINATIVE---
          The imagination has moved out of the realm of
          being our link, our most personal link, with our
          inner lives and the world outside that world--
          this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a
          horrifying state where what's in here doesn't
          match up with what's out there?
          Why has imagination become a synonym for style?
          I believe that the imagination is the passport
          we create to take us into the real world.
          I believe the imagination is another phrase for
          what is most uniquely Is.

                         
          Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious.
          Our boy Holden says "what scares me most is the
          other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you
          could both be blindfolded"--most of the time the
          faces we face are not the other guys' but our
          own faces. And it's the worst kind of
          yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put
          blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself.
          To face ourselves.
          That's the hard thing.
          The imagination.
          That's God's gift to make the act of self-
          examination bearable.

          PAUSE.
          FLAN, GEOFFREY, OUISA are very moved.

                         OUISA
          Well, indeed.

                         FLAN
          I hope your muggers read every word.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         42
          OUISA (chiding FLAN)

                         DARLING

                         GEOFFREY
          I'm going to buy a copy of Catcher i. the Rye at
          the airport and read it.

                         OUISA
          Cover to cover

                         PAUL
          I'll test you. I should be going.
          PAUL starts to go. THEY follow.
          THE DINING ROOM opens into

          THE LIVING ROOM.

                         FLAN
          Where will you stay?

                         OUISA
          Not some flea bag.

                         PAUL
           I get into the Sherry tomorrow morning. It's not
          so far off. I can walk around. I don't think
          they'll mug me twice in one evening.
          FLAN and OUISA take's PAUL's by the arm and leads him down
          the hall into

          THEIR DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM.

                         OUISA
          You'll stay here tonight.

                         PAUL
          No! I have to be at the hotel at seven AM sharp!

                         OUISA
          We'll get you up.

                         PAUL
          or Dad will have a fit.

                         QUISA
          Up at six fifteen which is any moment now and we
          have that wedding in Millbrook-
          OUISA pulls back the covers on the bed and puts the dolls on
          the floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         4 3

                         

                         FLAN
          There's an alarm by the bed

                         OUISA
          Your feet might hang out over the end

                         PAUL
          If it's any problem--

                         FLAN
          It's only a problem if you leave.
          PAUL takes the alarm and sets the time.

                          PAUL
          Six fifteen? I'll tip toe out.

                         FLAN
          And we want to be in Cats.

                         OUISA

                         FLAN:

                         PAUL
          It's done.
          THEY shake hands.

                         GEOFFREY
          I'll fly back. With my wife.

                         OUISA
          Pushy. Both of you.
          PAUL sits on the bed, testing it.

                         PAUL
          He's not. Dad said I could be in
          charge of the extras. You'd just
          be extras. That's all I can promise.

                         FLAK
          In cat suits?

                         PAUL
          No. You can be humans.

                         FLAN
          That's very important. It has to be in our
          contracts. We are humans.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         44

                         
          THEY all return down

          THE HALL.

                         GEOFFREY
          We haven't got any business done tonight.

                         FLAN
          Forget it. It was only an evening at home.

                         OUISA
          Whatever you do, don't think about elephants.
          GEOFFREY puts on his overcoat.

                         PAUL
          Did I intrude?
          FLAN and OUISA
          No!

                         PAUL
          I'm sorry - Oh Christ -
          GEOFFREY (to Flan)

                         0
          There's all ways of doing business. Flanders,
          walk me to the elevator.

                         OUISA
          Love to Diana.
          OUISA kisses GEOFFREY on the cheek.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR
          It seems the BRIDE and GROOM have joined the people
          listening to FLAN and OUISA's tale.

                         OUISA
          We embraced. And Flan and Geoffrey left -

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S HALL
          FLAN walks GEOFFREY to the elevator, leaving OUISA and PAUL
          alone. PAUL and OUISA look at each other. Then PAUL breaks
          the moment and goes to

          THE DINING ROOM.

                         _ PAUL
          Let me clean up -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         45
          OUISA follows.

                         OUISA
          Hal Leave it for -
          PAUL looks at the table filled with dishes and bowls and
          glasses and napkins.

                         PAUL
          Nobody comes in on Sunday.
          PAUL snuffs out the candles with his fingers.

                         OUISA
          Yvonne will be in on Tuesday.

                         PAUL
           You'll have every bug in Christendom -
          The room is dark, -lit only from the living room.
          THEY both reach for the dishes.

                         OUISA
          Let me -

                         
          PAUL takes the dishes.

                         PAUL
          No. You watch. It gives me a thrill to be
          looked at.
          PAUL looks at HER. OUISA is momentarily at a loss.
          PAUL goes into the kitchen.
          The service door into the kitchen swings back and forth.

          DINING ROOM/KITCHEN
          OUISA in the dining room looks at PAUL's back as HE washes
          dishes at the sink.
          Suddenly the dining room is flooded with light.
          FLAN has flicked on the light.

                         FLAN
          He's in.

                         OUISA
          He's in?
          FLAN parades around the table.

                         FLAN
          He's in for two million.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         46

                         

                         OUISA
          Two million!

                         FLAN
          He says the Cezanne is a great inv1stment. We
          should get it for six million and sell it to the
          Tokyo bunch for ten.

                         OUISA
          Happy days! Oh god!
          PAUL comes into the dining room.

                         PAUL
          Two million dollars?
          FLAN runs into

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          FLAN picks up the slide carousel and kisses it.

                         FLAN
          Figure it out. He doesn't have the price of -a
          dinner but he can cough up two million dollars
          and the Japs will go ten!
          PAUL and OUISA come into the living room.

                         PAUL
          Go to ten? Ten million?

                         OUISA
          Break all those dishes! Two million! Go to ten!
          And we put up nothing?

                         PAUL
          Nothing?

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey sold that Hockney print I know he
          bought for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago for
          thirty four thousand dollars. Sotheby took
          their cut, sure but still--Two million! Wildest
          dreams. Paul, I should give you a commission.

                         PAUL
          Your kids said you were an art dealer. But you
          don't have a gallery. I don't understand -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         47

                          FLAN
          People want to sell privately.
          Not go through a gallery.

                         OUISA -Ï¿½
          A divorce. Taxes. Publicity.
          FLAN (holding up a slide)
          People come to me looking for a
          certain school of painting.

                         OUISA
          A modern.. Impressionist. Renaissance.

                         FLAN
          But don't want museums to know where it is.

                         OUISA
          Japanese.
          OUISA, FLAN and PAUL go down the hall to

          FLAN'S OFFICE.
          FLAN flicks on his computer.

                         

                         FLAN
          I've got Japanese looking for a Cezanne. I have
          a syndicate that will buy the painting. There is
          this great second level Cezanne coming up for
          sale in a very messy divorce.
          FLAN holds up the slide.

                         OUISA
          Wife doesn't want hubby to know she owns a
          Cezanne.
          PAUL looks at the slide.

                         FLAN
          I needed an extra two million. Geoffrey called.
          Invited him here for dinner.

                         OUISA
          Tonight was a very nervous very
          casual very big thing.

                         PAUL
          I couldn't tell -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         48
          s PAUL gives the slide very carefully back to FLAN who files
          it.

                         OUISA
          All the better. 0
          FLAN opens a door in the OFFICE. THE OFFICE connects to

          THE MASTER BEDROOM.
          PAUL follows FLAN and OUISA into their bedroom.

                         PAUL
          I'm glad I helped -

                         OUISA
          You were wonderful!

                         PAUL
          I'm so pleased I was wonderful.
          All this and a pink shirt.

                         OUISA
          Keep it. Look at the time.

                         PAUL
          It's going to be time for me to get up.

                         FLAN
          Then we'll say our good nights now.

                         PAUL
          Oh Christ. Regretfully. I4l1 tip toe.
          PAUL and OUISA follow FLAN into

          THE HALL.
          PAUL goes into their daughter's bedroom.
          FLAN and OUISA hover in the hall.
          FLAN takes out his wallet.

                         FLAN
          Take fifty dollars.

                         OUISA
          Give him fifty dollars.

                         PAUL
          Don't need it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         49

                         

                         OUISA
          Suppose your father's plane is late?

                         FLAN
          A strike. Air controllers.

                         OUISA
          Walking around money. I wouldn't want my kids
          to be stuck in the street without a nickel.
          PAUL sits on the bed and takes off his shoes.

                         FLAN
          And you saved us a fortune. Do you know what
          our bill would've been at that little Eye-tie
          store front?

                         OUISA
          And we picked up two million dollars. One
          billionth of a percent commission is -

                         FLAN
          Fifty dollars.
          FLAN hands PAUL the money. PAUL hesitates, then takes it.

                         PAUL
          But I'll get it back to you tomorrow. I want my
          father to meet you.

                         OUISA
          We'd love to. Bring him up for dinner.

                         PAUL
          Could I?

                         FLAN
          You see how easy it is.

                         OUISA
          Sure. If Paul does the cooking.
          FLAN, OUISA and PAUL laugh.
          OUISA goes into the bathroom and fills a glass with water
          and puts it on the night table.

                         OUISA
          Goodnight.
          PAUL smiles at them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         50

                         

          THE MASTER BEDROOM/BATHROOM
          FLAN and OUISA get ready for bed, undressing, hanging jacket
          and trousers up neatly. OUISA undoes her dress.
          THEY are in and out of bathroom and bedroom, -brushing
          teeth.

                         FLAN
          I want to get on my knees and thank god -money-

                         OUISA
          Who said when artists dream they dream of money?
          I must be such an artist. Bravo. Bravo.
          FLAN putting on pajamas, OUISA her nightgown.

                         FLAN
          I don't want to lose our life here. I don't
          want all the debt to pile up and crush us.

                         OUISA
          It won't. We're safe.
          OUISA in bed turns off the light.
           FLAN looks out the window onto the park.

                         FLAN
          For a while. We almost lost it. If I didn't
          get this money,. Ouis, I would've lost the
          Cezanne. It would've gone. I had nowhere to
          get it.
          OUISA gets out of bed and comes to FLAN.

                         OUISA
          Why don't you tell me how much these things
          mean? You wait till the last minute -
          OUISA and FLAN get into bed.

                         FLAN
          I don't want to worry you.

                         OUISA
          Not worry me? I'm your partner.

                         FLAN
          There is a god.

                         OUISA
          And his name- is --

                         A

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         51

                          FLAN
          Geoffrey?

                         OUISA
          Sidney.
          THEY embrace. THE CAMERA comes in very close, circling
          FLAN and OUISA, their love, their safety. Then THE CAMERA
          drifts back and away from them, travelling out through the
          window, out of their cocoon to

          EXT THE APARTMENT BUILDING/CENTRAL PARK NIGHT
          down the face of the solid apartment building and drifts
          away through the night down into Central Park and stops at
          the statue of the husky barking at the moon.

          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR

                         OUISA
          I dreamt of Sidney Poitier and his rise to
          acclaim. I dreamt that Sidney Poitier sat at
          the edge of my bed and I asked him what troubled
          him? Sidney? What troubles you? Is it right
          to make a movie of Cats?

                         

          BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM
          FLAN is asleep on his side of the bed. OUISA is wide awake,
          staring at A MAN in dinner clothes, who sits on the edge of
          her bed. His back is to the camera. Is it SIDNEY POITIER?
          THE CAMERA drifts in to OUISA, who is transfixed by this
          apparition.
          "SIDNEY" (very comforting)
          I'll tell you why I have to make a movie of
          Cats. I know what Cats is, Louisa. May I call
          you Louisa?
          (OUISA nods Yes)
          I have no illusions about the merits of Cats.
          But the world has been too heavy with all the
          right to lifers. Protect the lives of the
          unborn. Constitutional amendments. Marches!
          When does life begin? Or the converse. The end
          of life. The Right To Die. Why is life at this
          point in the 20th century so focussed on the
          very beginning of life and the very end of life?
          What about the eighty years we have to live
          between those two inexorable book ends?
          THE CAMERA closes on OUISA. Her face, seen over "SIDNEY's"
          shoulder, is all wonder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         52

                         OUISA
          And you can get all that into Cats?
          THE CAMERA drifts round with OUISA'S gaze to finally see
          "SIDNEY'S" face. ï¿½,.
          It is PAUL.

                         PAUL/SIDNEY
          I'm going to try.

                         OUISA
          Thank you. Thank you. You shall.
          THE CAMERA circles off PAUL to OUISA. She is asleep.
          CUT BACK to reveal
          No one is sitting on the bed.
          THE CAMERA moves onto FLAN's face, sleeping.
          Slides of paintings by Matisse, Picasso, De Kooning, Pollock
          appear over his face.

                          FLAN (VO)
           This is what I dreamt. I didn't dream so much
           as realize this. I felt so close to the
           paintings. I wasn't just selling like pieces
           of meat. I remembered why I loved paintings in
           the first place - what had got me into this -
           and I thought - dreamed - remembered-

           INT AIRPLANE HANGAR
           FLAN happily sits in the bright vast empty space at a slide
           carousel projecting slides of paintings into the air.

                          FLAN (VO)
           How easy it is for a painter to lose a
           painting. He can paint and paint - work on a
           canvas for months and one day he loses it - just
           loses the structure - loses the sense of it -
           you lose the painting.
          A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT shines on FLAN who turns to see
          A TEACHER, in her forties, very pure and happy, hanging
          beautiful and brilliantly colored children's drawings in the
          air. FLAN'S VOICE echoes in this vast space.

          Why are all your students geniuses in the second
          grade? Look at the first grade. Blotches of
          green and black. Look at third grade.
          Camouflage. But the second grade --your grade.
          Matisses everyone. You've made my child a
          Matisse. Let me study with you. Let me into
          the second grade! What is your secret?

                         THE TEACHER
          Secret? I don't have any secret. I just know
          when to take their drawings away from them.
          THE TEACHER hangs pink shapes like paper versions of PAUL'S
          button down shirt on a clothes line stretching to the end of
          the hangar.
          THE SCREEN is filled with the color Pink.

          EXT PINK SKY DAWN
          The bright pink morning sky flashes with golden blotches,
          abstract, until WE see it is the morning sun reflecting off
          windows on the West Side of Central Park.
          Then we realize it is the view from

                         

          THE KIZTREDGE'S MASTER BEDROOM DAWN
          THE CAMERA pulls back from the window to FLAN and OUISA in
          bed, cozy. SHE wakens, smiles, kisses HIM.
          FLAN mumbles in his sleep and rolls over.
          OUISA looks at her bedside clock. 6 A.M.
          SHE gets out of bed, then pauses to take in the dawn
          display.
          OUISA walks through

          THE LIVING ROOM
          and opens the front door. SHE picks up the Sunday papers
          and goes into

          THE KITCHEN.
          OUISA looks at the spotlessly clean sink and counter.
          SHE flicks on the coffee machine and takes juice out of the
          refrigerator scanning the front page.
          SHE sits at the counter and opens the magazine to the back
          page and begins to do the cross word puzzle.

                         OUISA
          I sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross
          word puzzle in ink. Everybody does it in ink. I
          never. met one person who didn't say they did it
          in ink.

          BACK IN THE KITCHEN
          OUISA fills in a word on the puzzle. is it in ink? Then
          looks up.

                         OUISA (VO)
          And I'm doing the puzzle and I see the time and
          it's nearly seven and Paul had to meet his
          father and I didn't want him to be late and was
          he healthy after his stabbing?
          OUISA puts the puzzle down and goes into

          THE HALL.

                         OUISA (VO)
          The hall is eighteen feet long.
          OUISA walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long.

                         OUISA (VO)
          I stopped in front of the door.
          OUISA taps on the door of her daughter's room.

                         OUISA
          Paul?
          SHE hears - what? - sounds of moaning?

                         OUISA
          Paul??

                         PAUL (MOANING)

                         YES YES

                         OUISA
          Are you all right?
          OUISA opens the door to

          HER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         55
           SHE turns on the light. SHE screams.
           A GUY mid 20s, buck naked except for ratty white socks,
          stands up on the bed.

                         HUSTLER
          What the fuck is going on here. Who the fuck
          are you?!
          PAUL, startled,"sits up in bed and pulls on his clothes.
          OUISA screams.

                         OUISA
          Flan!!

          THE MASTER BEDROOM
          OUISA shakes FLAN violently. FLAN comes to.

                         FLAN
          What is it?!
          FLAN AND OUISA step out into

          THE HALL.

                         

          SILENCE.
          THEY hear their dog bark in

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          THE HUSTLER, naked but for white socks, wanders around the
          living room picking up things. THE DOG is barking at HIM.
          THE HUSTLER turns and smiles at FLAN and OUISA. -

                         HUSTLER
          Hey! How ya doin'? Nice stuff.

                         FLAN
          Oh my God!
          THE HUSTLER stretches out on the sofa.

                         HUSTLER
          Hey. I got to get some sleep--
          FLAN tips the sofa, hurling the HUSTLER onto the floor.
          THE HUSTLER leaps at FLAN threateningly.

                         OUISA
          Stop it! He might have a gun!

           HUSTLER (laughs)
          Yeah. I might have a gun. I might have a knife.
          THE HUSTLER raises his hand threateningly.

                         OUISA
          He has a gun! He has a knife!
          THE HUSTLER chases OUISA around the room.
          FLAN chases the HUSTLER. THE DOG chases FLAN.
          PAUL,dressed, runs in to the living room, carrying THE
          HUSTLER's clothes which HE hurls down onto the sofa.

                         PAUL
          I can explain.

                         OUISA
          You went out after we went to sleep and picked
          up this thing?

                         FLAN
          You brought this thing into our house! Thing!
          Thing! Get out! Get out of my house!
          FLAN picks up the HUSTLER'S clothes and opens the front
           door.

                         THE HUSTLER
          Hey! Be careful of the pants!

                         FLAN
          Take your clothes. Go back to sleep
          in the gutter.
          FLAN flings the clothes out into

          THE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR.
          FLAN pushes the elevator button.
          THE HUSTLER suddenly lunges at FLAN and grabs FLAN by the
          lapels of his bathrobe.

                         HUSTLER
          Fuck. You!
          THE HUSTLER throws FLAN back violently, then picks up his
          clothes.
          OUISA runs to FLAN.
          FLAN gasps, catching his breath.
          THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens..
          EDDIE, the elevator man, is startled by the sight.

                         57
          OUISA is terrified as PAUL stands at the front door.

                         PAUL
          Please. Don't tell my father. I don't want him
          to know. I haven't told him. I got. so lonely.
          I got so afraid. My dad coming. I had the
          money. I went out after we went to sleep and I
          brought him back. You had so much. I couldn't
          be alone. I was so afraid. I am so sorry.

                         OUISA
          Just go.

                         EDDIE
          Is everything all right?

                         FLAN
          Make sure they go out!

                         PAUL
          I can explain!

                         FLAN
          Give me my fifty dollars.

                          PAUL
           I spent it.

                          OUISA
           Get out!

                          PAUL
          I'm so sorry.
          THE HUSTLER is in the elevator, pulling on his seedy
          clothes.

                         FLAN
          Make sure they leave. By the back door.
          PAUL steps into the elevator. The door shuts.

          BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM
          FLAN and OUISA survey the room. THEY are at a loss.
          THEY straighten out the pillows on the sofa.
          THEY are exhausted.

          I am shaking.

                         OUISA
          You have to do something.

                         FLAN
          it's awful.

                         OUISA
          Is anything gone?

                         FLAN
          How can I look? I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          Did he take anything?

                         FLAN
          Would you concentrate on yourself?

                         OUISA
          I want to know if anything's gone?

                         FLAN
          Calm down.

                         OUISA

                         OUISA
          How can you think of things? We could
          have been murdered.
          FLAN picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver
          beaver.

                         FLAN
          There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why?

          would we have woken up?

                         FLAN
          we're alive.
          THEY sit on the sofa, drained, holding onto the phone.
          The phone suddenly rings. THEY clutch each other.

                         OUISA
          Don't pick it up!
          FLAN does.

                         KITTY
          The kid was mugged. We had to go out. We left
          him. He was so charming. His father was taking
          the red eye. He couldn't get into the Hotel
          till seven AN. He stayed with us.
          SHE is very pleased.

          screaming Burglar! Burglar! We came out in the
          hall. Paul is chasing this naked blonde thief
          down the corridor. The blonde thief runs out,
          the alarm goes off. The kid saved our lives.

          KITTY and LARKIN laugh.

          We feel so guilty. Paul could've been killed by
          that intruder. He was very understanding -

          Was anything missing from your house?

          He must be there under another name.
          Another phone call.

                         OUISA
          Hi. Celebrity Service? I'm not
           sure how you work.

                         KITTY
          Greta Garbo used the name Harriet Brown.

                         OUISA
          You track down celebrities? Am I right?

                         LARKIN
          Everybody must have known she was Greta Garbo.

                         OUISA
          I'm trying to find out how one would get in
          touch with---No, I'm not a press agent--No, I'm

          FLAN returns carrying an elaborate arrangement of flowers.
          FLAN reads the card.

          "To thank you for a wonderful time.
          Paul Poitier.'"
          FLAN reaches into the bouquet. HE takes out a p.t of jam.

                         FLAN
          A pot of jam?

                         LARKIN
          A pot of jam.
          THEY back off as if it might explode.

                         KITTY
          I think we should go to the police.

          EXT THE 19TH PRECINCT NIGHT
          THE FOUR approach the precinct on East 94th Street.

          INT THE PRECINCT
          THE DETECTIVE, whom we recognize from earlier, looks up from
          his desk.

                         

                         DETECTIVE
          What are the charges?

                         OUISA
          He came into our house.

                         FLAN
          He cooked us dinner.

                         OUISA
          He told us the story of Catcher In The Rye.

                         FLAN
          He said he was the son of Sidney Poitier.

                         DETECTIVE
          Sidney Poitier?
          FLAN and OUISA
          You got it.

                         DETECTIVE
          Was he?

                         OUISA
          We don't know.

                         FLAN
          We gave him fifty dollars.

                         KITTY
          We gave him twenty five.

                         OUISA
          He picked up a hustler.

                         FLAN
          He left.

                         KITTY
          He chased the burglar out of our house.

                         OUISA
          He didn't steal anything.

                         LARKIN
          We looked and looked.

                         KITTY
           Top to bottom. Nothing gone.
          THE DETECTIVE closes his notebook.

                         OUISA
          Granted this does not seem major now.

                         DETECTIVE
          Look. We're very busy.

                         FLAN
          You can't chuck us out.

                         DETECTIVE
          Come up with charges. Then I'll do something.

          INT THE MORGAN LIBRARY NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA have come to a charity do featuring a string
          quartet playing Schubert Trio in B flat.
          But FLAN and OUISA are not entranced by the music.
          THEY stand at the back of the room by the bar telling their
          story to a GROUP of fascinated FRIENDS (none of whom was at
          the wedding) as the QUARTET plays. These FRIENDS are all
          dressed formally but with the look of people who dress this
          way every night. There-'s always one of these going on and
          they're always there.

                         FLAN
          Yes, there is another chapter.

                         OUISA
          Our kids came down from Harvard. a
          Loud groans of protest and disbelief fill the

          KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM DAY
          Two of FLAN and OUISA'S college aged CHILDREN, WOODY and
          TESS, and KITTY and LARKIN'S boy, BEN, slump around the
          room. They are in dismay at OUISA, FLAN, KITTY and LARKIN
          and their story.

                         FLAN
          --the details he knew--how would he know about
          the painting?
          FLAN has taken the Kandinsky off the wall and flipped it
          around to the wild side.

                         FLAN
          Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky.
          FLAN leans the painting against a chair and studies it.

                         OUISA
          And none of you knows this fellow? He has this
          wild quality--yet, a real elegance and a real
          concern and a real consideration.
          TESS looks at the floral arrangement PAUL sent.
          It's only slightly wilted.

                         TESS
          Well, Mom, you should have let
          him stay. You should have divorced
          all your children and just let this
          dreamboat stay. Plus he sent you flowers.

                         FLAN
          And jam .

                         THE KIDS
          Oooooo.

                         OUISA
          I wish I knew how to get hold of his father.
          Just to see if there is any truth in it.

                         LARKIN
          Who knows Sidney Poitier so we could just call
          him up and ask him?

                         KITTY
          I have a friend who does theatrical law.
          I bet he -

                         LARKIN
          What friend?
          KITTY (suddenly trapped)
          Oh, it's nobody.

                         LARKIN
          I want to know.

                         KITTY (SCREAMS)
          Nobody!

                         LARKIN (RECONSIDERS)
          Whatever's going on anywhere, I do not
          want to know. I don't want to know.
          I don't want to know.

                         

                         KITTY (OVERLAPPING)
          Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.

                         BEN (OVERLAPPING)
          Dad. Mom. Please. For once. Please?
          BEN, KITTY, LARKIN scream at each other in anguish.
          TESS, in a fury, leaves the apartment.
          FLAN follows HER to

          THE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR.

                         FLAN
          Tess, when you see your little sister, don't
          tell her that Paul and the hustler used her bed.

                         TESS
          You put him in that bed. I'm not going to get
          involved with any conspiracy.

                         FLAN
          It's not a conspiracy. It's a family.
          THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens. TESS and FLAN virtually growl at
          each other as the door shuts on TESS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         70
           FLAN sees KITTY, LARKIN and BEN screaming at each other.
          FLAN sees OUISA, to avoid involvement in the domestic stir,
          hang the Kandinsky back on the wall.
          The geometric ordered side.

          EXT CENTRAL PARK DAWN
          The Alaskan Husky barks at the moon.
          THE CAMERA travels out of the park up the face of the Fifth
          Avenue apartment once again into the safety of

          THE MASTER BEDROOM.
          FLAN and OUISA are in bed asleep.
          OUISA sits up when SHE hears someone tapping insistently on
          the window pane. SHE looks around the room.
          PAUL appears outside on the window ledge wearing the pink
          shirt. OUISA gets out of bed and opens the window.

                         PAUL
          The imagination. That's our out. Our
           imagination teaches us our limits and then how
           to grow beyond those limits. The imagination
           says listen to me. I at your darkest voice. .I
          am your 4am voice. I am the voice that wakes
          you up and says this is what I'm afraid of. Do
          not listen to me at your peril. The
          imagination is the noon voice that sees clearly
          and says yes this is what I want for my life.
          It's there to sort out your nightmare, to show
          you the exit from the maze of-your nightmare, to
          transform the nightmare into dreams that become
          your bedrock. If we don't listen to that voice,
          it dies. It shrivels. It vanishes.
          (PAUL takes out a switch blade and opens it.)
          The imagination is not our escape. on the
          contrary, the imagination is the place we are
          all trying to get to.
          PAUL lifts his shirt and stabs himself.
          OUISA screams.
          PAUL falls over backward into space.
          The phone rings, waking OUISA. FLAN picks up the phone.
          OUISA sits up, a little stunned. She is relieved to find
          things so normal.

          INT THE PRECINCT EARLY MORNING

                         DETECTIVE
          I got a call that might interest you.

          And a new character entered our story

          EXT BETH ISRAEL DOCTORS HOSPITAL DAY
          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN come to this hospital
          across from Gracie Mansion.

          INT BETH ISRAEL DOCTORS HOSPITAL DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          DR. FINE, an earnest professional man in his 50s, comes
          down the hall, and opens his office door.
          FLAN, OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN sit in his office.

          DR. FINE
          I was seeing a patient. I'm an
          obstetrician at New York Hospital.
          The nurse opened my office door.

          INT EXAMINING ROOM DAY
           THE NURSE, a sturdy woman in her 50s, opens the door.

                         NURSE
          There's a friend of your son's here.
          PAUL appears,- looking much as HE was when HE came to FLAN
          and OUISA's. PAUL's shirt front is bleeding.

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          OUISA and FLAN, KITTY and LARKIN are filled with dread.

          DR. FINE
          I treated the kid. He was more scared than
          hurt. A knife wound, a few bruises.

                         EXAMINING ROOM
          PAUL gets off the examining table, buttoning his pink shirt.

                         PAUL

          is coming here.

          DR. FINE
          And he told me the name of a matinee idol of my
          youth. Somebody who had really forged ahead and
          made new paths for Blacks just by the strength
          of-his own talent. Strangely, I had identified
           with him, before I started Medical School. I
           mean, I'm a Jew. My grandparents were killed in
           the war. I had this sense of self-hatred, of
          fear. And this kid's father - the bravery of
          his films - had given me a direction, a
          confidence. Simple as that. We're always
          paying off debts. Then my beeper went off. A
          patient in her tenth month of labor. Her water
          finally broke. I gave'him the keys.

                         EXAMINING ROOM
          DR. FINE gives PAUL a set of keys and walks him out into

          THE HOSPITAL HALL.

                         

                         PAUL
          Doug's told me all about your brownstone. How
          you got it at a great price because there had
          been a murder in it and for a while people
          thought it had a curse but you were a scientific
          man and were courageous!

          DR. FINE
          Well, yes! Courageous!

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          FLA.N and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN agree.

                         FLAN
          Very courageous.

          DR. FINE
          I ran off to the delivery room. Twins! Two
          boys. I thought of my son. I dialed my boy at
          Dartmouth. Amazingly, he was in his room.
          Doing y hat I hate to ask.

           The call wakens DR. FINE'S son, DOUG, 20.
          DOUG grabs for the phone from under the covers. Is there
          someone else in bed with Doug?

          DR.FINE'S EXAMINING ROOM

          DR. FINE
          So you accuse me of having no interest in your
          life, not doing for friends, being a rotten
          father. Well, you should be very happy.

          COLLEGE DORM ROOM

                         DOUG
          The son of who? Dad, I never heard of him.
          Dad, as usual, you are a real cretin. You gave
          him the keys? You gave ,& complete stranger who
          happens to mention my name the keys to our
          house? Dad, sometimes it is so obvious to me
          why Mom left. I am so embarrassed to know you.
          You gave the keys to a stranger who shows up at
          your office? Mother told me you beat her! Mom
          told me you were a rotten lover and drank so
           much your body smelled of cheap white wine. Mom
           said sleeping with you was like sleeping with a
           salad made with bad dressing. Why you had to
           bring me into the world!
          A GIRL sits up in bed, terrified.

          You're an idiot! You're an idiot!
          THE GIRL in bed puts pillows over her head.

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN lean forward in
          fascination.

          DR. FINE
          I went home..-courageously with a policeman.

           EXT DR. FINE'S BROWNSTONE DAY
          DR. FINE puts the key in the door. The COP with HIM has his
          gun drawn. DR. FINE and THE COP enter

          THE BROWNSTONE.
          THEY hear a Debussy quartet playing.
          PAUL sits in the living room wearing a silk robe, swirling a
          snifter of brandy, listening to the music.
          PAUL smiles when HE sees DR. FINE, but when the COP appears
          with the gun, PAUL rolls over on his side out of the chair.

          DR. FINE
          Arrest him!
          DR. FINE snaps off the radio.
          PAUL backs up against the wall.

                         PAUL
          Pardon?

          DR. FINE
          Breaking and entering.

                          PAUL
          Breaking and entering?

          DR. FINE
          You're an imposter.

                         PAUL
          Officer, your honor, your eminence, Dr. Fine
          cave me the keys to his brownstone. Isn't that
          so?

          DR. FINE
          My son doesn't know you.

                         PAUL
          This man gave me the keys to the house.
          Isn't that so?
          THE COP puts his gun away.

                          POLICEMAN (SCREAMS)
           Did you give him the key to the house?

           DR. FINE
           Yes, but under false pretenses. This fucking
           black kid crack addict comes into my office

                         LYING -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         75
           PAUL (cool and forgiving)
          I have taken this much brandy but can pour the
          rest back into the bottle. And I've used
          electricity listening to the music, but I think
          you'll find that nothing's taken from the house.
          PAUL takes off the silk robe and neatly places it on the
          table.

          DR. FINE
          I want you to arrest this fraud.
          PAUL puts on his jacket and leaves the house.

          DR. FINE
          Stop him!
          THE POLICEMAN walks away.

          DOUG continues his tirade.

                         DOUG
          A cretin! A creep! No wonder mother left you!

                         
          DOUG flings the phone against the wall.

          DR. FINE'S OFFICE
          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN look at DR. FINE
          sympathetically.

          DR. FINE
          Two sides. Every story.
          But THE TWO COUPLES are also embarrassed.

          BACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY
          PEOPLE from the back row of the concert turn away from the
          music and listen to OUISA and FLAN.

                         OUISA
          We went down to the Strand -

                         FLAN

          THE STRAND BOOKSTORE.
          which advertises itself as possessing Eight miles of books
          and that seems an understatement.
          THE CAMERA rushes past rows of books.
          And then suddenly stops.

                         OUISA
          I found it!
          OUISA'S HAND reaches up and brings down.

                         CU
          A COPY OF SIDNEY POITIER'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY: "This Life"
          OUISA reads from the Poitier autobiography.
          THE OTHERS are enrapt..

                         OUISA
          "Back in New York with Juanita and the children,
          I began to become aware that our marriage,
           while working on some levels, was falling apart
          in other fundamental areas."
          FLAN takes the book.

                         FLAN
          There's a picture of him and his four-
          daughters. No sons. Four daughters.

          BACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY

                         FLAN
          The book's called This Life.

          THE FIVE of THEM have gone down the street fram the Strand
          to this swell restaurant.

                         FLAN
          Agatha Christie would ask what do
          we all have in common?

                         OUISA
          It seems the common thread linking us all is an
          overwhelming need to be in the movie of Cats.

                         KITTY
          Our kids. Struggling through their lives.

          spillover of their lives.

          All we have in common is our children went to
          boarding school together.
          FLAN (to Dr. Fine)
          How come we never met?

          DR. FINE
          His mother had custody. I lived out West. After
          he graduated from high school, she moved west.
          I moved east.

                         LARKIN
          I think we should drop it right here.

                         KITTY
          Are you afraid Ben is mixed up in this fraud?

                         LARKIN
          I don't want to know too much about my kid.

                         KITTY
          You think Ben is hiding things from us? I tell
          you, I'm getting to the bottom of this. My son
          has no involvements with any black frauds.
          Doctor, you said something about crack?

          I don't want to know.

          DR. FINE
          It just leaped out of my mouth.
          No proof. Oh dear god, no proof.

                         FLAN
          We'll take a vote. Do we pursue this to the end
          no matter what we find out about our kids?

                         OUISA
          I vote yes.

          DR. FINE
          I trust Doug. Yes.

                         LARKIN
          No.

                         FLAN
          Yes.
          KITTY looks through the Poitier autobiography.

                         KITTY
          Listen to the last page. ".. .making it better
          for our children. Protecting them. From what?
          The truth is what we were protecting those
          little people from... there is a lot to worry
          about and I'd better start telling the little
          bastards - start worrying!" The end.
          KITTY closes the book in dismay.
          OUISA, FLAN, LARKIN, and DR. FINE are each lost in thought.

          INT LINCOLN CENTER METROPOLITAN OPERA NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA, dressed formally, the way people used to
          dress for the opera, stand at the small champagne bar
          outside the boxes. Their similarly dressed FRIENDS are
          engrossed in the tale.

                         FLAN
          We all went up to Harvard.

                         OUISA
          We had to enlist our children -

          EXT HARVARD UNIVERSITY DAY
          FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN, and DR. FINE cut through
          the Harvard Yard at an urgent pace.

          INT ELIOT HOUSE HARVARD
          The FIVE PARENTS sit in the empty Dining Commons.
          THEY've come for lunch. And now lunch is over.
          TESS, WOODY, BEN and DOUG sit on the other side of the
          refectory table, glaring at their parents, lunch trays
          between the generations.
          STUDENTS walk in and out. THE PARENTS speak in hushed,
          library size whispers to avoid any echo.

                         FLAN
          It's obvious. It's somebody you went to High
          School with, since you go to different colleges.

          DR. FINE
          I just want to tell you how I appreciate
          your coming today -

                         DOUG
           Dad? Spare me?
          DOUG'S voice echoes.

                         OUISA
          He knows the details about our lives.

                         FLAN
          Who in your high school, part of your gang, has
          become homosexual or is deep into drugs?

                         TESS
          That's like about fifteen people.
          TESS enjoys her echo because it makes FLAN and OUISA
          uncomfortable.

                         LARKIN
          I don't want to know.

                         TESS
          I find it really insulting that you would assume
          that it has to be a guy. This movie star's son
          could have had a relationship with a girl in

                         HIGH SCHOOL---
          And BEN is just as loud.

                         HEN
          That's your problem in a nut shell.
          You're so limited.
          FLAN and OUISA try to shush them.

                         TESS
          That's why I'm going to Afghanistan.
          To climb mountains.

                         OUISA
          You are not climbing mountains.

                         FLAN
          We have not invested all this money in
          you to scale the face of K-2.
          TESS leans across the table, matching them whisper for
          whisper.

                         TESS
          Is that all I am? An investment?

                         

                         OUISA
          All right. Track down everybody in your high
          school class. Male. Female. Whatever. Not
          just homosexuals. Drug addicts. The kid might
          be a drug dealer.
          DOUG throws back his chair.

                         DOUG
          Why do you look at me when you say that? Do you
          think I'm an addict? A drug pusher? I really
          resent the accusations.

          DR. FINE
          No one is accusing you of anything. Sit down.
          LARKIN gets up and paces around the table.

                         LARKIN
          I don't want to know. I don't want to know.
          I don't want to know.

                         FLAN
          Nobody is accusing anyone of anything.
          I'm asking you to go on a detective search and
          find out from your high school class if anyone
          has met a Black kid pretending to be a movie
          star's son.

                          BEN
          He promised you parts in Cats?

                         OUISA
          It wasn't just that. It was fun.

                         TESS
          You went to Cats. You said it was an all time
          low in a lifetime of theater going.
          OUISA considers.

                         OUISA
          Film is a different medium.

                         TESS
          You said Aeschylus did not invent theater to
          have it end up a bunch of chorus kids wondering
          which of them will go to Kitty Kat Heaven.

                         OUISA
          I don't remember saying that.

                         FLAN
          No, I think that was Starlight Express -

                         

                         TESS
          Well, maybe he'll make a movie of Starlight
          Express and you can all be on roller skates!
          THE KIDS stand up.

                         DOUG
          This is so humiliating.

                         BEN
          This is so pathetic.

                         TESS
          This is so racist.

                         OUISA
          This is not racist!
          THE KIDS stride out of the DINING HALL into

          THE CORRIDOR.
          THEIR PARENTS run ahead trying to circle them.

                          DOUG
          How can I get in touch with anybody in high
          school? I've outgrown them.

                         KITTY
          Now can you outgrow them?
          You graduated a year ago!
          THE PARENTS stop in front of

          THE MAIN ENTRANCE
          blocking TESS and DOUG and BEN's escape. OUISA takes a red
          book out of her bag and brandishes at THEM.

                         OUISA
          Here is a copy of your yearbook. I want you to
          get the phone numbers of everybody in your

          mindless of the STUDENTS who freeze in the background as you
          would at a traffic accident.

                         WOODY
          You gave him my pink shirt? You gave a complete
          stranger my pink shirt? That pink shirt was a
          Christmas present from you. I treasured that
          shirt. I loved that shirt. My collar size has
          grown a full size from weight lifting. And you
          saw my arms had grown, you saw my neck had
          grown. And you bought me that shirt for my new
          body. I loved that shirt. The first shirt for
          my new body. And you gave that shirt away. I
          can't believe it. I hate this life. I hate
          you.

          EXT ELIOT HOUSE
          WOODY's wrath grows and grows and drives OUISA and FLAN,
          indeed all the PARENTS, out of the serene, venerable Harvard
          building onto the street. PASSERSBY stop and gape.
           WOODY doesn't care.

          You never do anything for me.

          So I went to MIT. He was there in
          his computer room and I just pressed
          him and pressed him and pressed him.
          I had this strapped to me.

          EXT A DOORWAY RAIN NIGHT
          PAUL dressed in ragged clothes stands huddled in a doorway
          to get out of the freezing rain.
          TRENT passes by the doorway.
          TRENT is gone.
          Then TRENT reappears and stares at PAUL.

          INT TRENT CONWAY'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          PAUL stands against the WHITE WALL we've seen earlier.
          Rain. Distant thunder. Jazz playing somewhere.
          PAUL, unlike the elegant PAUL we have seen, is dressed in
          torn jeans, a ripped tank top, dirty high top sneakers.
          This is the PAUL we first saw.

                         
          PAUL looks at TRENT with a mixture of contempt and I dare
          you.
          PAUL stretches out on the bed.
          HE pulls out a thick address -book from under him.

                         PAUL
          What's this?
          PAUL speaks.street talk speech. Hardly what we've heard.

                         TRENT
          My address book.
          TRENT tries to take the address book away from PAUL.

                         PAUL
          All these names. Addresses.
          Tell me about these people.
          TRENT lies along side PAUL.

                         TRENT
          This is where I wanted you to be...
          Right here...
          PAUL, hypnotised by the-'address book, slaps TRENT away from
          him and gets out of the bed.

          I just want to look at you. Sorry.

                         PAUL
          Are these all rich people?
          TRENT sits up in bed.

                         TRENT
          No. Hand to mouth on a higher plateau.

          PAUL paces around the room, looking into this book.

                         PAUL
          I think it must be very hard to be with rich
          people. You have to have money. You have to
          give them presents.

                         TRENT
          Not at all. Rich people do something nice for
          you, you give them a pot of jam.

                         PAUL (AMAZED)
          That's what pots of jam are for?

                         TRENT
          Orange. Grapefruit. Strawberry. But fancy.
          They have entire stores filled with fancy pots
          of jam wrapped in cloth. English. Or French.

                         PAUL
          I'll tell you what I'll do. I pick a name. You
          tell me about them. Where they live. Secrets.
          And for each name you get a piece of clothing.

                         TRENT
          All right.

          meet you for the first time and our friendship
          will be witnessed by my friends, our parents'
          friends. If it all happens under their noses,
          they can't judge me. They can't disparage you.

          This is the way you must speak. Hear my accent.

          Paul must have looked at all those
          names and said I am Columbus. I am Magellan.
          I will sail into this new world.
          The camera comes in on OUISA as she remembers

          THE KITTREDGE LIVING ROOM.
          TESS laughs. OUISA laughs. It's a nice moment between these
          two.

                         OUISA
          I read somewhere that everybody on this planet
          is separated by only six other people. Six
          degrees of separation. Between us and everybody
          else on this planet. The President of the
          United States. A. gondolier in Venice. Fill in
          the names. I find that A.] tremendously
          comforting that we're so close and B.] like
          Chinese water torture that we're so close.
          Because you have to find the right six people to
          make the connection. It's not just big names.
          It's anyone. A native in a rain forest. A
          Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to
          everyone on this planet by a trail of six
          people. It's a profound thought. How Paul found
          us. How to find the man whose son he pretends to
          be. Or perhaps j& his son, although I doubt it.
          How every person is a new door, opening up into
          other worlds. Six degrees of separation between
          me and everyone else on this planet. But to
          find the right six people.
          TESS kisses HER MOTHER.
          OUISA puts out the light and THEY leave the room.

          No. No news.

          He just vanished.

                          FLAN
          Nothing. All quiet. Thank god.
          THEY pass out of the box into

          EVERYONE is very cheery.

                         OUISA
          Yes! We are going to Rome.
          CONNIE gives OUISA a card with a name on it.
          OUISA reads the card and passes it to FLAN.

                         OUISA
          No! I don't know them.
          FLAN smiles when HE sees the card.

          Always wanted to meet them! Of course we'l1

          THE VATICAN.

                         FLAN (VO)
          Rome is always remarkable but to see -
          Columns flash past. The blurring clears and we are moving

                         INTO

          INT SISTINE CHAPEL
          with FLAN and OUISA. They are escorted, through a maze of
          scaffolding, by an elderly Italian ART DEALER.

                         FLAN (VO)
          the Sistine Chapel like this!

                         OUISA (VO)
          To stand at the very top on scaffolding!

                         
          FLAN and OUISA ride up through the scaffolding, in a
          rickety elevator.

                         OUISA
          We were at the opera and ran into them and they
          gave us your address!

                         FLAN
          This is staggering!
          THEY step out, in great excitement, right onto

          THE SISTINE CHAPEL SCAFFOLDING.

                         FLAN (VO)
          They restored it after all these years -
          FOUR ITALIAN WORKERS scrub away at the ceiling a few feet
          above them. They refer constantly to banks of computers
          operated by TWO JAPANESE.

                         OUISA (VO)
          scraped all this paint off it

                         FLAN (VO)
          and years of smoke and tourists and it's brand
          new!

           OUISA looks up. SHE is right beneath the hand of God
           touching the hand of Man. SHE looks at it in awe. To be
           this close to it! THE SCREEN is filled with the cleaned
          ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

          INT SOHO LOFT NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA sit on cushions of a Soho loft done in the
          most glamorous minimal Japanese mode.

          The colors are vibrant!

                         OUISA
          Flan went for business but for me it was -
          THE OWNERS of this loft are a MAN, 40s, who is confined to a
          wheel chair, and his beautiful COMPANION, an elegant
          Japanese woman. THE TEN DINNER GUESTS are dressed all in
          black, except OUISA who has on a bright Chanel suit. SHE
          and FLAN have managed to capture stage center.

          No. It's not important -

          You must!

                         OUISA
          Well, the day we got back from Rome -

                         FLAN
          We stepped out of the taxi from the airport and

          EXT THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING DAY
          FLAN steps out of the cab first.

                         OUISA (VO)
          our doorman whom we tip very well at Christmas
          and any time he does something nice for us-- our
          doorman spits at my husband, J. Flanders
          Kittredge. I mean, spit at him!
          The DOORMAN - FRANK - good faithful loyal FRANK - holds
          the door open and spits at FLAN.

          Darling, they don't have to know every detail.

          EXT THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING
          OUISA is afraid to come out of the cab.

                         DOORMAN
          Your son! I know all about your son.

                         FLAN
          What about my son?

                         DOORMAN
          Not the little shit who lives here. The other
          son. The secret son. The negro son you deny.

                         FLAN
          The negro son?

                         DOORMAN
          The black son you make live in Central Park
          while you're gallivanting around Rome.

          No! The cops brought this young girl to us!

                         OUISA
          The cops called us up and we went
          down to the precinct again!

          THE DETECTIVE sits on the edge of his desk.
          OUISA and FLAN sit in chairs in the small office, looking on
          uncomfortably. The emotion in the shabby room is too big for
          the size of it. THEY watch a young woman named ELIZABETH,in
          her mid-20s, seated behind the DETECTIVE'S desk.

          My boy friend and I took a picnic
          into the park

          EXT CENTRAL PARK DAY
          RICK, ELIZABETH and PAUL sprawl out on the grass in the
          sun, under the statue of the Alaskan husky, the remains of a
          picnic around them. Bongo Drums play in the distance.

                         ELIZABETH (VO)
          and we met this guy and started
          singing and talking.
          RICK, a nice young guy in his mid-twenties, plays his guitar
          energetically, the THREE of them having a great time singing
          a cheery old rock song.
          PAUL is wearing the pink shirt and the khakis but looks
          pretty seedy. HE eats hungrily.

                         PAUL
          I was hallucinating from not eating-

                         ELIZABETH
          If I told people back home that
          New York had trees and picnics,
          they'd swear I was lying. I love New York so
          much. Look at it! I can't get over it.

                         RICK
          We're here from Utah.

                         PAUL
          Do they have any black people in Utah?

                         RICK
          Maybe two.

          I saw them once. Two black people.

                         RICK
          Yes, the Mormons brought in two.
          THEY all laugh, enjoying each other, the day, the meeting.

                         ELIZABETH
          We came here to be actors.

                         RICK
          She won the all-state competition
          for comedy and drama.

                         PAUL
          My gosh!
          ELIZABETH stands up and declaims.

                         ELIZABETH
          "The quality of mercy is not strained.
          It droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven.."
          SHE's not bad. But then SHE giggles and the Shakespearean
           effect crumbles.

                         RICK
          And we study and we wait tables.

                         ELIZABETH
          Because you have to have technique.
          ELIZABETH and RICK are very earnest.

                         PAUL
          Like the painters. Cezanne looked for the rules
          behind the spontaneity of Impressionism.

                         RICK
          Cez - That's a painter?

                         ELIZABETH
          We don't know anything about painting.

                         PAUL
          My dad loves painting. He has a Kandinsky but
          he loves Cezanne the most. He lives up there.

                         RICK
          What?

          He lives up there. Count six windows over.
          John Flanders Kittredge. His chums-call him
          Flan. I was the child of Flan's hippie days.
          His radical days. He went down South as a
          freedom marcher, to register black voters - his
          friends were killed. Met my mother. Registered
          her and married her in a fit of sentimental
          righteousness and knocked her up with me and
          came back here and abandoned her. Went to
          Harvard. He's now a fancy art dealer. Lives up
          there. Count six windows over. Won't see me.
          The new wife--the white wife-- The Louisa
          Kittredge Call Me Ouisa wife - the mother of the
          new children wife--

                         RICK
          Your brothers and sisters?

                         PAUL (BITTER)
          They go to Andover and Exeter and Harvard and
          Yale. The awful thing is my father started out
          good. My mother says there is a good man inside
          s J. Flanders Kittredge.

                         ELIZABETH
          He'll see you if he is that good. He can't
          forget you entirely.

                         PAUL
          I call him. He hangs up.

                         RICK
          Go to his office -

                         PAUL
          He doesn't have an office. He works out of
          there. They won't even let me in the elevator.

                         RICK
          Dress up as a messenger.

                         ELIZABETH
          Say you have a masterpiece for him.
          "I got the Mona Lisa waitin' out in the truck."

                          PAUL
          I don't want to embarrass him. Look, this is so
          fucking tacky.

                         (PAUSE)
          You love each other? a

                         ELIZABETH
          A lot.
          RICK and ELIZABETH touch each other's hands.
          PAUL (standing up to go)
          I hope we can meet again.

                         RICK
          Where do you live?
          PAUL looks around HIM and makes a hopeless grand gesture.

                         PAUL
          Live? I'm,home.
          PAUL picks up two plastic shopping bags which are filled
          with clothing.

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          You're not out on the streets?

                         PAUL
          You're such assholes. Where would I live?
          PAUL shrugs his shoulders and leaves.
          RICK and ELIZABETH look at each other then follow him down
          the path leading through the park to the carousel.
          THE CAROUSEL calliope plays merrily.

                         RICK
          Stay with us.

                         ELIZABETH
          We just have a railroad flat in a tenement --
          PAUL looks at a bank of daffodils planted by the carousel.
          HE begins picking a bouquet of daffodils.
          RICK and ELIZABETH are being as persuasive as they can.

                         RICK
           It's over a roller disco. The last of the
           roller discos but it's quiet by five AM and a
          great narrow space -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         100

                          ELIZABETH
          A railroad loft and we could give you a corner.
          The tub's in the kitchen but there's light in

                         THE MORNING-

                         SOHO LOFT

                         OUISA
          And he did!

          INT RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT DAY
          RICK and ELIZABETH'S tenement is disastrously crummy and
          probably violates every building code. But, yes, light
          does flow in through that one narrow window.
          PAUL puts the bouquet of daffodils into a jelly jar and sets
          it down on a board that covers the tub.

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH composes herself.
          OUISA pours ELIZABETH a glass of water.

                         ELIZABETH
           He stayed for a few weeks. He taught
          us so much. We even thought he was the
          reason for coming to New York. He opened
          up a new world for us. That's all anybody
          wants, isn't it? A new world?
          OUISA looks at FLAN.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK and ELIZABETH listen intently to PAUL.

                         PAUL
          This is the way you must speak.
          Hear my accent. Hear my voice.
          Never say you're going horse back riding.
          You say You're going Riding. And don't
          say Couch. Say Sofa. And you say bodd-ill.
          It's bottle. Say bottle of beer.

                         RICK
          Bodd-ill a bee-ya.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         101
          ELIZABETH pokes around in the refrigerator.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SERIOUS)
          Hello. ï¿½. _

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Hello.
          (SHE discovers two bottles of beer)
          Hello hello!
          SHE opens the beers. PAUL regards RICK for a moment.
          PAUL takes the bottle of beer.
          RICK and ELIZABETH share the other.

                         PAUL
          Bottle of beer. And never be afraid of rich
          people. You know what they love? A fancy pot
          of jam. That's all. Get yourself a patron.
          That's what you need. You shouldn't be waiting
          tables. You're going to wake up one day and the
          temporary job you picked up to stay alive is
          going to be your full time life.
          ELIZABETH is struck by his advice and embraces PAUL
          gratefully.

                         

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH is more pulled together, sipping her drink of
          water. FLAN takes OUISA's hand.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK and ELIZABETH have made love and lay on their backs in
          bed and dream.

                         RICK
          I'll tell you all the parts I want to play.
          Vanya in Uncle Vanya.

                         ELIZABETH
          Masha in Three Sisters.

                         RICK
          I'd like a -
          ELIZABETH is on fire with happiness and unwittingly cuts off

          RICK.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, Irina first. The young one
          who yearns for love.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         102

                          RICK
           I'd like a shot at -

                         ELIZABETH
          Then Masha who loves.

                         RICK
          I'd like a shot -

                         ELIZABETH
          Then the oldest one, Olga, who never knows love!
          RICK'waits to see that ELIZABETH is through, then:

                         RICK
          I'd like a shot at Laertes. I think
          it's a much better part.
          ELIZABETH gazes in a mirror that- SHE holds close to her
          face.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you think it'll hurt me?

                         RICK
           What'll hurt you?

                         ELIZABETH
          My resemblance to Liv Ullmann.
          PAUL runs into the loft.

                         PAUL
          He wrote me! I wrote him and he _
          wrote me back! He's going to give
          me a thousand dollars! And that's
          just for starters! He sold a Cezanne
          to the Japanese and made millions and
          he can give me money without her knowing it.
          PAUL lets out a whoop and leaps up onto the bed with RICK
          and ELIZABETH in it and begins jumping up and down.

                         ELIZABETH
          I knew it!
          PAUL goes to a corner which contains a single mattress on
          the floor and begins to pack his few things back in the
          plastic bags.

                         PAUL
          I'm moving out of here!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         103

                         
          ELIZABETH reaches for her robe and pulls it on.
          RICK pulls on his jeans.

                         ELIZABETH
          You can't!

                         RICK
          No!
          RICK and ELIZABETH surround PAUL to make HIM stay.
          PAUL hugs THEM.

                         PAUL
          But I am going to give you the money to put on a
          showcase of any play you want and you'll be in
          it and agents will come see you and you'll be
          seen and you'll be started. And when you win
          your Oscars - both of you - you'll look in the
          camera and thank me -
          ELIZABETH loves the moment and weeps her acceptance speech.

                         ELIZABETH
          I want to thank Paul Kittredge.

                         RICK
          Thanks, Paul!
          THEY all hug each other and that's real.

                         PAUL
          One hitch. I'm going to meet him in Maine. He's
          up there visiting his parents in Dark Harbor.
          My grandparents whom I've never met. He's
          finally going to tell my grandparents about me.
          He's going to make up for lost time. He's going
          to give me money. I can go back home. Get my
          momma that beauty parlor she's wanted all her
          life. One problem. How am I going to get to
          Maine? The wife checks all the bills. He has
          to account for the money. She handles the purse
          strings. Where the hell am I going to get two
          hundred and fifty dollars to get to Maine?

                         ELIZABETH
          How long would you need it for?

                         PAUL
          I'll be gone a week. But I could wire
          it back to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         104
          PAUL goes into the john to take his toothbrush and razor.
          ELIZABETH pulls on her dress and straightens out her hair.

                         RICK (QUIET)
           We could lend it to him for a week.

                         ELIZABETH (QUIET)
          We can't. If something happens -

                         RICK (QUIET)
          You're like his stepmother. These women holding
          on to all the purse strings.

                         ELIZABETH
          No. We worked too hard to save that.
          PAUL comes out of the john.
          RICK - always laid back - is suddenly quite angry.

                         ELIZABETH
          Paul. I'm sorry. We just can't.

                         PAUL
          Look. No problem. I understand.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'll meet you both after work. If your father
          loves you, he'll get you the ticket up there.

                         PAUL
          He does. It'll work out. Hey.
          Posture. Stand up straight. Don't slump.
          Attitudes of defeat.
          ELIZABETH kisses PAUL and looks at sullen RICK and leaves.

                         SOHO LOFT

                         OUISA
          She was one of those armies of
          young people who come to New York
          filled with dreams and end up on a treadmill
          working and working just to stay alive.

          INT A WEST SIDE RESTAURANT NIGHT
          ELIZABETH is one of the few waitresses in this crowded bar
          and works very hard.

          EXT CASH MACHINE NIGHT
          ELIZABETH gapes at the information on the screen.

                         "ACCOUNT CLOSED"
          ELIZABETH begins hitting the machine to get her card back.
          ELIZABETH picks up the phone on the machine and calls the
          emergency number.
           ELIZABETH (in phone)
           There's some mistake. It says my joint account
           - can you see the numbers on the screen - that's
          right. that's my name. And his name. Joint
          account. What do you mean? Closed? Who closed
          the account? Who took everything out of the
          account? Who did this! Give me my card back!
          THE GUY next in line nudges her.

          THE NEXT CUSTOMER
          Let somebody else in here.

          EXT THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING NIGHT
          An hysterical ELIZABETH goes into

                         

          THE LOBBY.
          FRANK, the DOORMAN, is having a snooze.
          ELIZABETH shakes him. HE wakes up terrified at the sight of
          this hysterical creature over HIM.

                         ELIZABETH
          - people named Kittredge. This Kittredge guy
          has a black son he makes live in the park -

                         FRANK
          Mr. Kittredge has what?

                         ELIZABETH
          His black son took money from me -

                         FRANK
          You have to be quiet

                         ELIZABETH
          I want to get up to see them!

                         FRANK
          You'll have to call or write a letter -

                         ELIZABETH
          They owe me money!

                         106
           FRANK takes ELIZABETH by the arm and ushers her out of

          THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT BUILDING.
          FRANK, the DOORMAN, bolts the front door to the-building.
          ELIZABETH bangs on the door.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm here trying to get to meet people.
          I am stranded. Who do I know to go to?
          I want my money. I work tables. I work hard.
          A CAB pulls up. A POSH COUPLE steps out of the cab to go
          into 910 Fifth. THEY look at ELIZABETH.

                         ELIZABETH
          "The quality of mercy is not strained?"
          Fuck you, quality of mercy.
          FRANK opens the door quickly. THE POSH COUPLE scoots in.
          ELIZABETH kicks the building.

          INT ORSO'S RESTAURANT NIGHT
           FLAN and OUISA have come to this Broadway Italian restaurant
          after the theater with a MAN and WOMAN who from their dress
          and manner are obviously in the theater: ANDREW and ZEANNIE.
          FLAN and OUISA are in mid-story.

                         FLAN
          - all over the building that I had abandoned
          some mistake of my past in Central Park!
          THE COUPLE gasps!

                         JEANNIE
          But it's too fantastic!

                         FLAN
          Can't you just see me marching
          down South for Freedom Now!

                         OUISA (PROUDLY)
          Yes. Yes, I can.

                         FLAN
          It was so embarrassing.

                         ANDREW
          Horrible!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         107

                         OUISA
          It wasn't so embarrassing.

                         JEANNIE
          I bet Flan loves being outraged.
          FLAN (mock outrage)
          I don't!

                         ANDREW
          You do! Flan loves getting into
          high dudgeon! His cheeks go all rosy!
          Look at his cheeks! Dudgeon becomes him.
          THEY all laugh as the WAITRESS puts down the plates of food.

                         FLAN
          To high dudgeon!
          THEY all toast.
          But OUISA has stopped laughing.

          INT RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TEN EME NT NIGHT
          ELIZABETH sits up in bed in the dark. SHE impassively
          watches a rat scramble across the floor. RICK comes in,
          drained, dressed in a baby blue tuxedo with a ruffled blue
          shirt - the kind of tux worn at high school proms.

                         RICK (BRIGHT)
          Hi!
          ELIZABETH puts on the light.

                         ELIZABETH
          Where's the money?

          BACK IN ORSO'S RESTAURANT
          OUISA continues her tale.

                         DUISA
          - she understandably wanted to know.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK laughs brightly and sits beside HER on the bed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         108

                          RICK
          No! Let me explain. Paul found some extra
           money of his own and he wanted to thank us for
           staying here! He would've treated you but you
           had to work or else we would've . We rented
          these tuxedos! Isn't it a gas! He's going to
          give us the money back! And then I'm going to
          take you to the Rainbow Room. That's where we
          went! I brought you matches!

          INT THE RAINBOW ROOM NIGHT
          RICK, in his ruffled blue tux, and, PAUL, in impeccable
          black tie, look into the Rainbow Room.
          THE CAPTAIN takes THEM to a table by the window.
          RICK and PAUL look out over the city. The view is magic!

                         RICK (WHISPERS)
          Now did we get this table!

                         PAUL
          Stick with me, baby. I know the
          right name to drop.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK (laughs brightly)
          And it's not that expensive for what you get.
          Well, it's not a bargain but it's

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          THE WAITER opens a bottle of champagne.

                         RICK
          How an I going to explain to Elizabeth
          about the money?
          PAUL tastes the champagne. THE WAITER pours.

                         PAUL
          She'll have it back. With interest. Wonderful
          bouquet. Bouquet. That's what you call the
          taste of the wine. And I believe that wine from
          the even numbered years is generally the
          superior to the odd numbered years. Although
          it's just a theory - Cheers! Skol! Prosit!

                         RICK
          You are just about the greatest -
          THE DANCE ORCHESTRA plays a salute to 1930's romance.

                          PAUL
          Do you want to dance?

                         RICK
          Elizabeth has never seen anything l_4e here. I
          wish she was... Who do we dance with?
          THE ORCHESTRA segues into a tango. PAUL stands.

                         RICK
          We're guys.

                         PAUL
          Every moment in life is a learning experience or
          what good is it? Right? Right?

                         RICK
          Well, yes.

                         PAUL
          Then let this bunch of jerks see class.

                         ORSO'S RESTAURANT
          FLAN nods for their dinner guests, ANDREW and JEANNIE.

                         
          A little bit of titillation.

                         FLAN
          They danced. That's right! High
          over New York City.

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          RICK and PAUL go to the dance floor and begin to dance,
          PAUL leading. RICK loving it.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK tries to laugh it up into a wild experience.
          ELIZABETH sits impassively.

                         RICK
          I swear nothing like this ever
          happened in Utah.

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          At first PEOPLE don't notice RICK and PAUL dancing. Then
          PEOPLE do notice.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         110

           RICK (VO)
          And, I'll tell you, nothing like that must have
          ever happened at the Rainbow Room because they
          asked us to leave. It was so funny.
          PAUL spins RICK round and round and the CAMERA spins with

          THEM.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT

                         RICK
          You'll love the place. It's up so high.

          THE RAINBOW ROOM
          THE CAMERA spins around the panoramic view sixty-five floors
          and then spins out of the windows down onto

          EXT THE ICE RINK ROCKEFELLER CENTER NIGHT
          THE CAMERA focusses in on a COUPLE spinning in the middle of
          the ice. RICK and PAUL, hysterical with laughter, cut
          through Rockefeller Center and then come to Fifth Avenue
          where A HANSOM CARRIAGE waits. THE DRIVER tips his hat to
          these customers. PAUL jumps into

          THE HANSOM CARRIAGE.

                         RICK
          We don't have any money -

                         PAUL
          Amigo! When will you learn! Money is one
          commodity you can always get.
          THE HANSOM CARRIAGE proceeds up to Central Park.
          RICK leans forward looking out the isinglass windows.

                         RICK
          I'm going to have to explain to Elizabeth about
          the money and calm her. She gets so nervous

                         ABOUT-
          (PAUL draws a circle on RICK's back.)
          Hey, stop that. Paul. Come on.

                         PAUL
          I was wondering if I could fuck you.
          RICK laughs. Then sees PAUL is serious.

                         RICK
          I don't do things like that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         111

                         

                         PAUL
          That's what makes it so nice. You don't.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK reaches over and turns off the light by the bedside.
          Downstairs we hear the throb beginning of the roller disco.
          ELIZABETH looks at him coldly.

                         RICK
          - and he did and it was fantastic.

          THE HANSOM CARRIAGE
          Time has passed.
          PAUL kisses an amazed, mussed RICK on the mouth and jumps
          out of the CARRIAGE and goes off into the dark.

          EXT CENTRAL PARK
          THE DRIVER stands up seeing PAUL run out. RICK runs out of
          the CARRIAGE after PAUL. THE DRIVER chases them.

                         CU
          RICK lost in the nighttime park.
          RICK looks up and sees the STATUE OF THE HUSKY.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK paces back and forth.

                         RICK
          Didn't we come here for experience? Right? We
          can use this. Right?
          ELIZABETH lies on her stomach on the bed away from him.

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH rolls a pencil back and forth on the desk.
          FLAN and OUISA watch sympathetically.

                         ELIZABETH
          He rambled on for hours. His own father
          warned me Rick was a fool and I looked
          at Rick and knew his father was right.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         112

           RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
           RICK paces back and forth in a rage, pulling at his tux.

           RICK - -
           My father is not right! I can't have him be
           right. I wanted experience. We came here for
          experience. What's so wrong with that? Right?
          ELIZABETH is repelled by him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't touch me!

                         THE PRECINCT
          ELIZABETH rubs her hands over her face as if trying to get
          the memory away.
          OUISA looks at FLAN and THE DETECTIVE.

                         ELIZABETH
          He went on for a long time trying to get me
          just to look at him. I couldn't even do that.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT

                         

                         RICK
          But I didn't come here to do this or lose that
          or be this or do this to you. Not to you. Look
          at me? Elizabeth! What did I let him do to me?

                         ELIZABETH
          Nobody did this but you.

          BACK IN ORSO'S RESTAURANT

                         FLAN
          Now the amazing part is

                         OUISA
          talk about six degrees

                         FLAN
          We were in the roller disco that night!
          ANDREW and JEANNIE's jaws drop.

                         OUISA
          Yes! There we were roller skating for heart
          disease or cancer -

                         FLAN
          It was illiteracy.

          INT ROLLER DISCO NIGHT
          MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE all dolled up roll skate around and
          around trying to keep their balance to 40s swing music.
          Among the SKATERS we spot FLAN and OUISA at this ROLLER
          DISCO BENEFIT skating round and round breathlessly going
          faster and faster, laughing and laughing.
          Lights flash and whirl.

                         ORSO'S RESTAURANT

                         OUISA
          I hadn't skated in I hate to tell you how many

                         YEARS -

                         FLAN
          We came outside giddy and reeling

                         0

          EXT ROLLER DISCO NIGHT
          Lights reflect in a puddle on the wet street. THE CAMERA
          pulls back to reveal it is a puddle of blood, seeping out of
          a crumpled body.

                         OUISA (VO)
          The body must have just landed there in a clump

                         FLAN (VO)
          Because the blood seeping out had not yet
          reached the gutter...

                         OUISA (VO)
          The blood just oozing out slowly
          towards the curb.
          FLAN and OUISA and another COUPLE, SANDY and CONNIE from
          the wedding, stop at the sight. They stare at the body
          that has slammed into the pavement. The body of RICK.

                         FLAN (VC)
          The boy had jumped from above.

                         OUISA (VO)
          We just missed it by minutes.

                         ORSO'S RESTAURANT

                         OUISA
           Perhaps we could have saved him - called an
          ambulance - but it was too late -

                         FLAN
          He could've landed on us!
          ANDREW and JEANNIE are appalled. No!
          OUISA frowns.

                         JEANNIE
          It's so funny you say that. Yesterday we walked
          through the park by Gracie Mansion

                         ANDREW
          and it was cold and we saw police putting a
          jacket on a man sitting on a bench.

                         JEANNIE
          Only we got closer and it wasn't a jacket.

                         ANDREW
          It was a body bag. A homeless person
           had frozen during the night.

                         OUISA
          Was it that cold?

                         ANDREW
          Sometimes there are periods where you see death
          everywhere.
          FLAN waves to someone over there.
          THE WAITRESS brings coffees.
          OUISA looks straight ahead.

          THE PRECINCT DAY
          OUISA and FLAN sit with the DETECTIVE and ELIZABETH.

                         DETECTIVE
          When this young lady told me the black kid was
          your son, it all seemed to come into place.
          What I'm saying is she'll press charges.

                         ELIZABETH
          I want Paul dead. He took all our money. He
          took my life. Rick's dead! You bet your life
          I'll press charges.

                         OUISA
          We haven't seen him since that night.

                         DETECTIVE
          Find him. We might have a case. a

                         OUISA
          How do we find him?

                         FLAN
          We'll trap him. I'll release it to the papers.
          I can call the New York Times. I have friends.
          They'll publish the story. Someone will see
          it. And turn him in. We'll find Paul.

                         OUISA
          Six degrees. Six degrees.
          OUISA looks at FLAN. FLAN is so secure.

          INT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT DAY
          FLAN, in his bathrobe, opens the door and picks up the
          morning paper.
          t HE scans through the paper, then lets out a whoop and runs
          through the apartment to

                         INSERT
          NEW YORK TIMES article entitled:

          OUISA is making a breakfast drink at the blender.
          FLAN (reading from the Times)
          "Smart sophisticated tough New Yorkers such as
          J. Flanders Kittredge who opened their homes and
          pocket books to a young man learned yesterday
          they had been boondoggled by a confidence man
          now wanted by police -
          FLAN pounds the kitchen counter in glee.
          OUISA looks at him, askance.

          EXT LINCOLN CENTER THE STATE THEATRE NIGHT
          The fountain shoots up. The camera drifts up the face of
          the State Theatre. It's intermission. FLAN and OUISA are
          out on the terrace in,.mid story talking to A COUPLE (ALEX
          and LILY) who are there with a YOUNG GIRL who is obviously
          an aspiring ballerina.

          We were in Aspen.
          THE CHIME signals the intermission's end.

                         FLAN
          I'll send you the clipping.

                         OUISA
          You could wall paper the Empire State Building
          with all the copies he made.

                         ALEX
          We'll meet right here at the next intermission-
          THEY return inside.

          THE YOUNG BALLERINA
          Did you ever hear from Sidney Poitier?

                         FLAN
           No.

                         ALEX

          It's a second level Matisse -

                         OUISA
          but a Matisse -

          Then it's the Germans.

                         FLAN
          They'll go as high as -

          Not that much in this new market.

          Ugh. Bring back the 80s.
          I'll have to give most of it away, but the good
          part is it gives me a credibility in this new
          market. It's all out of whack. Everything's
          up. Everything's down. I mean, a David Fucking

          away all evidence of time and cellulite and--

          Hello?

                         OUISA
          Paul?
          We will cut back and forth between these two locations for
          the remainder of this scene. At times, the two will share
          the screen.
          During this scene OUISA walks throughout THE APARTMENT
          speaking on the cordless phone.

                         PAUL
          I saw the story in the paper. I didn't know the
          boy killed himself. He gave me the money. I
          didn't steal any -

                         OUISA
          Let me put you on hold. I'm
          talking to my child.

          If you put me on hold, I'll be gone and you'll
          never hear from me again.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S HALL

                         OUISA
          You have to turn yourself in. The boy comaitted
          suicide. You stole the money. The girl is
          pressing charges. They're going to get you.
          Why not turn yourself in and you can get of f
          easier. You can strike a bargain. Learn when
          you're trapped. You're so brilliant. You have
          such promise. You need help.

                         PAUL
          Would you help me?

                         OUISA
          What would you want me to do?

                          PAUL
          Stay with you.

          That's impossible-.

                         PAUL
          Why?

                         OUISA
          My husband feels you betrayed him.

          Do you?

                         OUISA
          You were lunatic! And picking that drek off the
          street. Are you suicidal? Do you have AIDS?
          Are you infected?

                         PAUL
          I do not have it. It's a miracle. But I don't.
          Do you feel I betrayed you? If you do, I'll
          hang up and never bother you again -

                         OUISA
          Where have you been?

          Travelling.

                         OUISA
          You're not in trouble? I mean, more trouble?

                         PAUL
          No, I only visited you. I didn't like the first
          people so much. They went out and just left me
          alone. I didn't like the doctor. He was too
          eager to please. And he left me alone. But you.
          You and your husband. We all stayed together.

                         CUISA
          What did you want from us?

                         PAUL
          Everlasting friendship.

                         OUISA
          Nobody has that.

                         PAUL
          You do.

                          OUISA
          What do you think we are?

                         PAUL
          You're going to tell me secrets? You're not
          what you appear to be? You have no secrets.
          Trent Conway told me what your kids have told
          him over the years.

                         OUISA
          What have the kids told him about us?

                         PAUL
          I don't tell that. I save that for blackmail.

                         OUISA
          Then perhaps I'd better hang up.

                         PAUL (PANIC)
          No! I went to a museum! I liked
          Toulouse-Lautrec!

                         OUISA
          As well you should.

          Ahh, you've become an aesthete.

                         PAUL
          Are you laughing at me?

                         OUISA
          No. I read them too.

                         PAUL
          I read The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone
          about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.

                         DUISA
          You're ahead of me there.

                         PAUL
          Have you seen the Sistine Chapel?

                         OUISA
          Oh yes. Even gone to the top of it in a rickety
          elevator to watch the men clean it.

                         PAUL
           You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel?

          touching the hand of man.

                         THE WORKMAN
          Hit it. Hit it. It's only a fresco.
          OUISA looks up at the hand of God. SHE laughs and slaps
          the hand of God.
          PAUL smiles in wonderment as the SCREEN fills with color.

          surroundings of his phone booth.

                         OUISA
          Look, why don't you cone here. Where are you?
          PAUL, pressed in the battered phone booth, doesn't want to
          be in this cold street with its brightly lit squalor. HE
          wants to be at OUISA's, but his fear wins out.

                         PAUL
          I come there and you'll have the cops waiting.

                         OUISA
          You have to trust us.

                         PAUL
          Why?

                         OUISA
          Because - we like you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         126
           FLAN (mouths)
          Where is he?
          PAUL, straining to hear, gets very paranoid.

                         PAUL
          Who's there?

                         IT'S -
          I'm not here.
          It's Flan.
          FLAN groans impatiently.
          PAUL brightens.
          THE OPERATOR makes noises.
          PAUL drops a coin in the box.

                         PAUL
          Are you in tonight? I could come and make a
          feast for you.

                         

                         OUISA
          We're going out now. But you could be here when
          we come back.

                         FLAN
          Are you nuts! Tell a crook we're going out. The
          house is empty.

                         PAUL
          Where are you going?

                         OUISA
          To Sotheby's.
          FLAN grabs the phone.

                         FLAN (SARCASTIC)
          The key's under the mat!
          PAUL is as cheery as HE can be.

                         PAUL
          Hi! Can I come to Sotheby's?
          FLAN thrusts the phone back to OUISA.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         127

                         OUISA

                         
          Hi.

                         PAUL
          I said hi to Flan.

                         OUISA

                         FLAN

                         OUISA

                         PAUL
          That's wonderful! I'll come!

                         OUISA
          You can't.

                         PAUL
          Why? I was helpful last time -

                         FLAN
           Thank him - he was very help -
          OUISA hands FLAN the phone.

                         FLAN
          Paul? You were helpful getting me that money
          for the Cezanne. You impressed Geoffrey -

                         PAUL
          Really! I was thinking maybe that's what I
          should do is what you do - in art but making
          money out of art and meeting people and not
          working in an office -

                         FLAN
          You only see the glam side of it. There's a
          whole grotty side that -

                         PAUL
          I could learn the grotty -

                         FLAN
          You have to have art history. You have to have
          language. You have to have economics -

                         -- PAUL
          I'm fast. I could do it. Do your kids want to

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         128

                         FLAN
          No, it's not really a profession you hand down
           from generation to gen - what the hell at I
           talking career counselling to you! You
           embarrassed me in my building! You stole money.
           There is a warrant out for your arrest.'
           OUISA (wrests the phone away)
          Don't hang up! Paul? Are you there? Paul!
           (TO FLAN) You made him hang up -

                         PAUL
          I'm here.

                         OUISA
          You are! Who are you? What's your real name?

                         PAUL
          If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you.
          That night was the happiest night I ever had.
          OUISA (to Flan)
          It was the happiest night he ever had.

                         FLAN

                         
          Oh please. I am not a bullshitter but never
          bullshit a bullshitter.
          FLAN goes.
          SHE paces into the KITCHEN, looking at the implements PAUL
          had used that night, the funny candelabra.

                         OUISA
          Why?

                         PAUL
          You let me use all the parts of
          myself that night -
          OUISA opens the door into the DINING ROOM.

                         OUISA
          It was magical. That Salinger stuff -
          SHE turns on the chandelier in the DINING ROOM.

                         PAUL
          Graduation speech at Groton two years ago.

                         OUISA
          Your cooking -

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         129

                          PAUL
           Other people's recipes. Did you see Donald
          Harthleme's obituary? He said Collage was the
          art form of the 20th century.

                         OUISA
          Everything is somebody else's-

                         PAUL
          Not your children. Not your life.
          SHE walks around the empty dining room table.

                         OUISA
          Yes. You got me there. That is mine.
          It is no one else's.

                         PAUL
          You don't sound happy.
          SHE walks back into the LIVING ROOM.

                         OUISA
           There's so much you don't know. You are so.
           smart and so stupid -

                         
           PAUL slams the side of the phone booth.

                          PAUL (FURIOUS)
           Never say I'm stupid -

                          OUISA
           Have some flexibility! You're stupid not to
           recognize what you could be.

                         PAUL
          What could I be?

                         OUISA
          So much.

                         PAUL
          With you behind me?

                         OUISA
          Perhaps. You liked that night?
          I've thought since that you spent
          all your time laughing at us.

                         PAUL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         130
          SHE walks down the HALL.

                         DUISA
          That you had brought that awful hustling thing
          back to show us your contempt -

                         PAUL
          I was so happy. I wanted to add sex to it.
          Don't you do that?
          OUISA looks into the MASTER BEDROOM and goes in.

                         DUISA (PAUSE)
          No.

                         PAUL
          I'll tell you my name.

                         OUISA
          Please?

                         PAUL
          It's Paul Poitier-Kittredge.
          It's a hyphenated name.
          SHE sits on her bed.

                         OUISA
          Paul? You need help. Go to the police. Turn
          yourself in. You'll be over it all the sooner.
          You can start.

                         PAUL
          Start what?

                         OUISA
          Your life.

                         PAUL
          Will you help me?
          OUISA stands up.

                         OUISA
          I will help you. But you have to go to the
          police and go to jail and -

                         PAUL
          Will you send me books and polaroids of you and
          cassettes? And letters?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         131

                         OUISA
          Yes.
          OUISA walks rapidly down the HALL.

                         PAUL
          Will you visit me?

                         OUISA
          I will visit you.

                         PAUL
          And when you do, you'll wear your
          best clothes and knock em dead?
          SHE's in the LIVING ROOM.

                         OUISA
          I'll knock em dead. But you've got to be careful
          in prison. You have to use condoms.

                         PAUL
          I won't have sex in prison. I only
          have sex when I'm happy.

                          OUISA
          Go to the police.

                         PAUL
          Will you take me?

                         OUISA
          I'll give you the name of-the detective to see-

                         PAUL
          I'll be treated with care if you
          take me to the police. If they don't
          know you're special, they kill you.

                         OUISA
          I don't think they kill you.
          PAUL puts the phone receiver over his head in a sudden
          gesture of fear. Then HE returns the receiver to his ear.

                         PAUL
          Mrs. Louisa Kittredge, I am black.

          PAUSE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         132

                         OUISA
           I will deliver you to them with
          kindness and affection.

                         PAUL
          And I'll plead guilty and go to
          prison and serve a few months.

                         OUISA
          A few months tops.

                         PAUL
           Then I'll come out and work for
          you and learn -

                         OUISA
          We'll work that out.

                         PAUL
          I want to know now.

                         OUISA
          Yes. You'll work for us.

                         PAUL
          Learn all the trade. Not just the grotty part.

                         

                         OUISA
          Top to bottom.

                         PAUL
          And live with you.

                         OUISA
          No.

                         PAUL
          Your kids are away.

                         OUISA
          You should have your own place.

                         PAUL
          You'll help me find a place?

                         OUISA
          We'll help you find a place.

                         PAUL
          I have no furniture.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         133

                          OUISA
          We'll help you out.
          PAUL beams as HE becomes the PAUL from that night. His
          imagination is off and running. The lights, from wherever
          HE is, shine on his face and reflect on the broken glass of
          the booth.

                         PAUL
          I made a list of things I liked in the museum.
          Philadelphia Chippendale.

                         OUISA
           Believe it or not, we have two Philadelphia
          Chippendale chairs -

                         PAUL
          I'd rather have one nice piece than
          a room full of junk.

                         OUISA
          Quality. Always. You'll have all that.
          Philadelphia Chippendale.

                         PAUL
           All I have to do is go to the police.

                         OUISA
          Make it all history. Put it behind you.

                         PAUL
          Tonight.

                         OUISA
          It can't be tonight. I will take you tomorrow.
          We have an auction tonight at Sotheby's -

                         PAUL
          Bring me?

                         OUISA
          I can't. It's black tie.

                         PAUL
          I have black tie from a time I
          went to the Rainbow Room. Have
          you ever been to the Rainbow Room?

                         OUISA
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         134

                         PAUL
          What time do you have to be there?

                         OUISA
          Eight o'clock.

                         PAUL
          It's five thirty now. You could come
          get me now and take me to the police
          tonight and then go to Sotheby's--

                         OUISA
          We're going to drinks before at the Pierre.

                         PAUL
          Japanese?

                         PAUL
          You're just like my father.

                         OUISA
          Which father?

                         PAUL
          Sidney!

          PAUSE.

                         OUISA
          Paul. He's not your father. And
          Flanders. is not your father.
          FLAN comes in to the living room, dressed.

                         FLAN
          Oh fuck. We have drinks with the Japanese at
          six- fifteen - Get off that fucking phone. Is
          it that kid? Get him out of our life! Get off
          that phone or I'll rip it out of the wall!
          OUISA (looks at FLAN)
          Paul, I made a mistake. It is not the Germans.
          We will come right now and get you. Where are
          you? Tell me? I'll take you to the police. They
          will treat you with dignity.

          EXT PHONEBOOTH BY THE MARQUEE OF THE WAVERLY THEATER,

                         GREENWICH VILLAGE

                         PAUL
          I'm in the lobby of the Waverly movie theater on
          Sixth Avenue and Third Street.

          KITTRIDGE'S LIVING ROOM

                         OUISA
          We'll be there in half an hour.

                         PAUL
          I'll give you fifteen minutes grace time.

                         OUISA
          We'll be there. Paul. We love you.

                         PAUL
          Ouisa., I love you. Ouisa Kittredge. Hey?
          Bring a pink shirt.

                         OUISA
          We'll have a wonderful life.
           SHE hangs up and looks at FLAN.

                         OUISA
          We can skip the shmoozing. Pick
          the boy up, take him to the police
          and be at Sotheby's before eight.

          INT A FORMAL DINING ROOM
          Of all the PARTIES we've been to, this is the most luxurious
          of all, given by one of New York's legendary hostess's, a
          glamorous woman who must be in her late 80s, MRS. BANNISTER.
          OUISA and FLAN are here.
          This dinner is really a state occasion in honor of that
          United Nations type at MRS. BANNISTER'S right.
          But FLAN and OUISA have captured the table.

                         OUISA
          t The story ended there...

                         FLAN
          It did not!
          Clearly OUISA is as disturbed by the telling of the events
          as FLAN is energized.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         136

                         OUISA
           There are so many other people here tonight. We
          didn't mean to take up so much
          MRS. BANNISTER slams her napkin down.

          MRS. BANNISTER
          No! It's my supper and I command you to sing!

                         FLAN
          We called our new best friend, the detective.

                         OUISA
          We told them Paul was at the Waverly theater.
          FLAN (to his dinner partner)
          Sixth Avenue and Third Street. The lobby.

                         OUISA
          But we had promised Paul that we would
          bring him to the police. We told the police he
          was special.

                         FLAN
          Well, Ouisa did.

                          OUISA
          The detective said he'd honor our promise.

                         FLAN
          We skipped the cocktails

                         OUISA
          But we didn't count on

          EXT TRAFFIC ON FIFTH AVENUE
          OUISA and FLAN in dinner clothes are stuck in a traffic jam.

                         OUISA (VO)
          Traffic traffic traffic
          FLAN gets out of the car and looks ahead in this din of
          honking horns.

          EXT WAVERLY MOVIE THEATER, GREENWICH VILLAGE NIGHT
          FLAN and OUISA speed up Sixth Avenue and double park in
          front of the Waverly Movie Theater.
          Two Cop cars are there. Red lights spinning.
          PEOPLE gape on the street.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         137
          THEY see PAUL being dragged into one of the two Cop cars,
          t kicking and screaming.
          THE COPS throw PAUL into the back seat.
          FLAN tries to talk to one of the POLICE while OUISA runs up
          to the Cop car window.
          PAUL, being handcuffed, looks at OUISA. HE smiles as if
          HE's bumped into DUISA at a cocktail party.

                         PAUL
          The Kandinsky is painted on both sides.
          DUISA is startled. THE COP slams the car door on PAUL.

                         OUISA
          Paul? Officer? Let me go with you -
          I promised I'd take him!

                         OFFICER
          Lady. Out of the way --
          FLAN takes OUISA's-arm.

                         OUISA
          We have to do soaething!

                         FLAN

                         
          Let's just get the hell out of here.
          THE COP CAR pulls away, sirens blaring.
          PAUL turns and looks at OUISA. Betrayal.

          BACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM

          MRS. BANNISTER
          There's nothing more you can do -

                         FLAN
          What could we do? We tried.

                         OUISA
          went to the precinct.

          INT THE PRECINCT DAY
          DUISA hands the detective's card to the DESK CLERK.

                         CLERK
          He's transferred.

                         OUISA
          Since yesterday? He's been handling this

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         138

                         CLERK
           He's transferred -

                         OUISA
          This is about an arrest made yesterday at the
          Waverly Movie theater -
          THE CLERK checks the records.

                         CLERK
          This precinct didn't do any business at the
          Waverly Theater.

                         OUISA
          I didn't imagine it -

                         CLERK
          I'm not saying you did.

                         OUISA
          Could you find out which precinct -
          THE CLERK looks through the book.

                         CLERK
          The name?

                         

                         OUISA
          Poitier. He's a young black man. Or maybe
          Kittredge. I don't know the exact name -

                         CLERK
          Are you family?

                         OUISA
          Not exactly. But the detective
          promised me yesterday that I could go with the
          young man when he was arraigned to let them know
          he was special.

                         CLERK
          We have no record of it. Some other precinct
          must have made the arrest. It sounds like your
          special friend was wanted for something else.

                         OUISA
          Like what?

                         CLERK
          Lady, how can I help you? You don't even know
          your friend's name.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         139

                         OUISA
           We can find anybody - Six degrees
          THE CLERK closes the book.

          BACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM

                         OUISA
          We weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.

          EXT HOGAN PLACE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DAY

                         OUISA (VO)
          I went to the District Attorney's office.
          we weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.

          EXT THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING

                         OUISA (VO)
          I called the Criminal Courts.
          I wasn't family. I didn't know Paul's name.

          THE FORMAL DINING ROOM

                         OUISA
          You see, I read today that a young man
          committed suicide in Riker's Island.
          Tied a shirt around his neck and hanged
          himself. Was it the pink shirt? This
          burst of color? The pink shirt. Was it Paul?
          We never found out who he was.

                         FLAN
          I'm sure it's not him.

          MRS. BANNISTER
          Yes. I agree. Isn't it amazing.

                         FLAN
          He'll be back. We haven't heard the last of
          him. The imagination. He'll find a way. Could
          we talk about something else? Our guest of
          honor tonight- it's such a pleasure to meet you-
          But.THE GUEST OF HONOR FROM THE UN leans forward.

          THE GUEST OF HONOR
          Why does it mean so much to you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         140

                         OUISA
           He wanted to be us. Everything we are in the
          world, this paltry thing--our life--he wanted
          it. He stabbed himself to get into our lives.
          He envied us. We're not enough to be envied.

                         FLAN
          Like the papers said. We have hearts.

                         OUISA
          Having a heart is not the point. We were hardly
          taken in. We believed him -- for a few hours.
          He did more for us in a few hours than our
          children ever did. He wanted to be your
          child. Don't let that go. He sat out in that
          park and said that man is my father. He's in
          trouble and we don't know how to help him.

                         FLAN
          Help him? He could've killed me. And you.
          THE GUESTS agree.

                         OUISA
          You were attracted to him -

                         
          FLAN throws down his napkin in mock outrage. Almogj mock
          outrage.

                         FLAN
          Cut me out of that pathology! You are
          on your own -

                         OUISA
          Attracted by youth and his talent and the
          embarrassing prospect of being in the movie
          version of Cats. Did you put that in your Times
          piece? And we turn him into anecdote to dine out
          on. Like this. As we are right now. But it was
          an experience. I will not turn him into an
          anecdote. How do we fit what happened to us
          into life without turning it into an anecdote
          with no teeth and a punch line we'll mouth over
          and over for years to come. "Tell the story
          about the imposter who came into our lives---"
          "That reminds me of the time this boy--". And
          we become these human juke boxes spilling out
          these anecdotes. But it was an experience. How
          do we keep the experience?
          OUISA looks around the dinner table.
          THE GUESTS have decided to start on their dinners.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         141
          FLAN (to his Dinner Partner)

                         
          That's why I love paintings. Cezanne. The
          problems he brought up are the problems painters
          are still dealing with. Color. Structure.
          Those are problems.
          OUISA (to herself)
          There is color in my life, but I'm not
          aware of any structure.

                         FLAN
          What are you saying, darling?
          OUISA looks at FLAN clinically. FLAN frowns and turns back
          to his dinner partner brightly.

                         FLAN
          Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his
          canvasses if he couldn't account for the brush
          stroke, give a reason for the color.

                         OUISA
          Then I am a collage of unaccounted-for brush
          strokes. I an all random.
           OUISA stands up from the dinner table.
          Her chair scrapes. There is an embarrassed rush.
          MRS. BANNISTER (an order)
          Sit down.
          OUISA leaves the dinner table.

          THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE FORMAL DINNER PARTY
          OUISA pushes the elevator button.
          FLAN comes into the hall.

                         FLAN
          What kind of behavior is -

                         OUISA
          God, Flan, how much of your life
          can you account for?
          THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens.

                         FLAN
          Do you realize how important this woman is!
          SHE steps in the elevator. FLAN follows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         142
          THEY descend in silence, not wanting a scene in front of the
          THE OPERATOR. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens into the lobby.

          INT PARK AVENUE LOBBY NIGHT
          FLAN follows OUISA through the lobby.

                         FLAN
          Are you drunk? What are you unhappy about? The
          Cezanne sale vent through. The Matisse went
          through. We are rich. Geoffrey's rich. Next
          month there's a Bonnard and after that -

                         OUISA
          These are the times I would take a knife and dig
          out your heart. Answer me? How much of your -

                         FLAN
          - life can I account for! All! I am a gambler!
          OUISA smiles at the simplicity of her realization.

                         OUISA
          We're a terrible match.
          OUISA steps out onto

          EXT PARK AVENUE NIGHT
          FLAN (following OUISA)
          She is a very important woman. I am hoping to
          do business! Did you see the paintings on her
          walls! She might want to sell! She
          FLAN glares at HER and turns back into the lobby and returns
          to the party.
          OUSIA moves to follow FLAN, then walks up PARK AVENUE, lost,
          agitated, unsure.
          OUISA walks on, remembering

          THE SISTINE CHAPEL.
          OUISA's hand completes the action.
          OUISA slaps the frescoed ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
          OUISA slaps the Hand of God!

	A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.  In the

	Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on 

	his shoulder.  As the mourners go past and each takes a 

	turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --

		    If we start asking why we'll go 

		    crazy.  So, rule number one.  

		    We don't ask why.



							CUT TO:



	CLOSE ON ANNIE REED



	Pretty, blonde, animated.  Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore 

	Orioles hat.



				 ANNIE

		    Why? I just want to know why? 

		    That's my first rule.  I always 

		    ask why.  Come on.  Tell me.  

		    C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --



	And pull back to reveal:



	EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY



	Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy 

	named SETH.  They're carrying packing boxes into the 

	house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.  

	The same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up 

	the back wooden staircase to the house.



				 SETH

		    There's no why, Annie.  I'm 

		    just not up for it.  I never 

		    said I was.



				 ANNIE

		    Is there somebody else?



				 SETH

		    Nope.



				 ANNIE

		    You don't love me, is that it?



				 SETH

		    Nope.



	Follow them into:



	INT. KITCHEN - DUSK



	As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to 

	assemble them.



				 ANNIE

		    How about ... you're too 

		    narcissistic to commit to 

		    another human being in a long-

		    term way.



				 SETH

			   (agreeably)

		    That's good.



							CUT TO:



	INT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY



	An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are 

	stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a 

	months.  A number of friends and relatives talk quietly 

	in the living room beyond.  Sam stands alone by a window 

	that looks into the backyard.  We can see a garden of 

	flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.



				 SUZY

		    Five minutes in the microwave.  

		    Any one of them, five minutes 

		    and done.  Ready to eat.  Do 

		    you know how to make juice?



				 SAM

		    Microwave.  Five minutes.



							CUT TO:



	ANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER



	Packing boxes.  Seth is moving out.



				 ANNIE

		    You take the microwave?



				 SETH

		    What am I going to do with a 

		    microwave?



				 ANNIE

		    You turn it on, you open it and 

		    you stand in front of it for a 

		    very long time.



				 SETH

		    So you're angry.  Big deal.



							CUT TO:



	SAM'S OFFICE - DAY



	A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-

	rise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with 

	several architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at 

	his desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over 

	to him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind 

	but a little stuffy.



				 ROB

		    Young man, it's none of my 

		    business, but maybe you should 

		    talk to someone.  I myself 

		    have consulted a professional.  

		    I used to be up tight.



	On Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more 

	uptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out 

	of his shirt pocket and reads them off.



				 SAM

		    Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...

		    Loss of Spouse support groups...

		    Single parent discussion nights...

		    Parents without partners.

			   (starts riffling, angry)

		    Partners without parents.  

		    People who need people.  Guys 

		    who go into the woods, beat 

		    drums and bond.  Get a shrink.  

		    Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.



	He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring 

	at him.  Quickly they pretend they weren't paying 

	attention.  Someone whispers something to a client.



				 SAM

			   (continued)

		    Don't mind him.  He's the guy 

		    who just lost his wife.

			   (beat)

		    What I really think is we need 

		    a change.



				 ROB

		    Good idea.  Take a few weeks 

		    off, get some sun, take Jonah 

		    fishing --



				 SAM

			   (shaking his head no)

		    A real change.  New city.  

		    Someplace where every time I go 

		    around a corner I don't think 

		    of Maggie.



	And hold on Sam for a moment and--

	The Living Section of the paper.  Annie is blowing her 

	nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her 

	boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.



				 LAURIE

		    Honey, he wasn't right for you.



				 ANNIE

			   (blowing her nose)

		    I know.



				 LAURIE

		    He wasn't even wrong for you, 

		    like cosmically wrong, so don't 

		    beat up on yourself for 

		    wasting...however long it was.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.

			   (blowing her nose 

			    again)



	She pours Annie a cup of hot water.  Annie pulls a 

	teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.



				 LAURIE

		    Maybe you should see a shrink.



			         ANNIE

		    I want my money.



				 LAURIE

		    Go home for the weekend.



				 ANNIE

			   (after a beat)

		    That's what I'm going to do.  

		    I'm going to go home.

			   (she thinks about it)

		    I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm 

		    going back to Baltimore.

		    How does a blonde do a high-

	She smacks herself in the head.

	They pass each other going in diagonal directions and 

	continue on.



	We stay with Sam's group:



				 JONAH

			   (to Mack)

		    Dad says I'm going to get used 

		    to it, but I don't think you 

		    can ever get used to a

			   (to Sam)

		    Eventually, in a few months, 

		    you'll start seeing women, 

		    you'll meet someone.



				 SAM

		    Move on.  Right.  That's what 

		    I'm going to do.  In a few 

		    months, boom, I'll be fine, 

		    I'll just grow a new heart.



				 SUZY

		    I'm sorry --



				 GREG

		    Sam, she didn't mean --



	Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for 

	the Seattle plane.

	Baltimore plane.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm going to meet someone, 

		    someone nice and stable who 

		    wears a hat so he won't catch a 

		    cold, and I'm going to marry 

		    him and have three children 

		    and live happily ever after.  

		    I mean, I am not cut out for this 

		    --


				 DIANE

		    For what?



				 ANNIE

		    For life as we know it.



				 LAURIE

		    Just make sure he isn't fat 

		    like my Michael or you'll spend 

		    your whole life worrying he's 

		    going to drop dead.



				 JUDITH

		    God, you guys are so romantic.



				 ANNIE

		    Do you know how long romance 

		    lasts?

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    That long.



				 DIANE

		    Steven still brings me flowers 

		    every Friday and we've been 

		    married 10 years.



				 LAURIE

			   (to Diane)

		    Honey, nobody wants to hear 

		    that.

			   (to Annie)

		    Here, darling, have some Tic 

		    Tacs.



	Kissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded 

	with stuff.



				 ANNIE

		    The next time you see me I am 

		    going to be incredibly happy.



	INT. PLANE - NIGHT



	Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the 

	runway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches 

	over and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus.



				 SAM

		    I'm your dad.  Don't ever 

		    forget that.  That's rule 

		    number two.

	Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the

		    I guess it's just us.



	She gulps.



	EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT



	The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for 

	instructions.



	And now they both start to take off.  In opposite 

	directions.



	And we pull back back back back as the planes take off, 

	one flying east, the other flying west.



	And further and further back as they soar into the air 

	and leave the frame.



	The night sky.



	Stars twinkle.



	And now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks 

	like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by 

	Saul Steinberg.



	A light goes on in Baltimore.



	A light goes on in Seattle.



	They are the only lights on the map.



	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE



	As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER 

	JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're 

	carrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're 

	walking toward the parking lot.



				 WALTER

		    The short one with black hair 

		    is your cousin Irene --



				 ANNIE

		    -- who's married to --



				 WALTER

		    Harold, who ran away with his 

		    secretary but came back --



				 ANNIE

		    -- because Irene threatened to 

		    put the dog to sleep if he 

		    didn't --



				 WALTER

		    And your brother Tom is a 

		    psychology professor and is 

		    married to...Betsy --



				 ANNIE

		    -- who is the most competitive 

		    woman in the world --



	They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and 

	pull out together.



	EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT



	Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in 

	front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park 

	their cars.  They get out assembling presents.



				 WALTER

		    Your Uncle Milton lost all his 

		    money in a Puerto Rican 

		    condominium that went belly up, 

		    don't mention the IRS or the 

		    Federal prison system.  Your 

		    mother is Barbara, your father 

		    is Cliff --



				 ANNIE

		    I hope he doesn't get out his 

		    slides.



				 WALTER

		    Am I what they had in mind?



				 ANNIE

		    They're going to love you.



	As they start toward the house.



							CUT TO:



	CLANGING ON THE WINE GLASSES.



	AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



	INT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT



				 BARBARA

		    Everybody! Annie has an announcement --



				 ANNIE

		    Walter and I are engaged!



	And the family's at the diner table.  Annie's family is 

	a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only 

	everyone is a little eccentric.  Annie's mother BARBARA, 

	a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, 

	claps her hands together.  Her father CLIFF, who's at 

	the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.  

	Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table, 

	along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.  UNCLE 

	MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.  

	There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.



				 IRENE

		    That's wonderful, Annie.  I 

		    hope it lasts... for years 

		    and years.



				 BETSY

			   (the competitive one)

		    Do you have a ring?



				 ANNIE

		    No.  Not yet.



				 BETSY

		    Oh.  Well.  How will anyone 

		    know?



				 TOM

		    Because you're going to call 

		    them all and tell them.  

		    Congratulations, Walter.



	He claps Walter on the back.



	Walter sneezes.  And sneezes again.



				 CLIFF

		    Are you all right?



				 WALTER

		    It's nothing.  Nothing.



				 ANNIE

		    It's probably just the flowers --



				 BARBARA

		    We'll move them --



				 WALTER

		    Don't touch them.  I feel 

		    terrible sneezing at a time 

		    like this.  This is a big 

		    moment for me --



				 ANNIE

			   (overlapping)

		    He's allergic to everything, 

		    don't worry about it --



				 HAROLD

		    Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.



				 CLIFF

		    Not salmon I hope --



				 ANNIE

		    If he eats one tiny piece of a 

		    nut --



				 WALTER

			   (cheerfully)

		    My head swells up like a 

		    watermelon and I drop dead.



				 IRENE

		    It's the same with Harold and 

		    bees.



				 CLIFF

		    Your mother and I had salmon at 

		    our wedding, and I really think 

		    a wedding without cold salmon --



				 WALTER

		    I'm not allergic to salmon.  I 

		    don't think.  But you never 

		    know.



				 HAROLD

		    You never know.



				 BARBARA

		    Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we 

		    used up this magnum of 

		    champagne we were saving on 

		    something else, what did we use 

		    it for?



				 TOM

		    Uncle Milton's parole --



				 BARBARA

		    Right.



				 UNCLE MILTON

		    And it was delicious.



				 BARBARA

		    It was, wasn't it, Milton 

		    darling --



				 BETSY

		    When are you getting married, 

		    Annie?



				 CLIFF

		    In early June.  In the garden.



				 HAROLD

		    Does it have to be in the garden?



				 IRENE

		    What about Harold and bees?



				 BARBARA

		    We'll spray you.



				 CLIFF

		    Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumber 

		    salad.  Strawberries.



				 WALTER

		    I'm afraid I'm allergic to 

		    strawberries.



				 CLIFF

		    No strawberries.



	Annie smiles at Walter.



				 ANNIE

			   (to Walter)

		    Is that all right with you?



				 WALTER

			   (to Lou Gehrig line)

		    Today I consider myself the 

		    luckiest man on the face of 

		    the earth.



				 IRENE

		    What are you wearing?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know.



				 BETSY

		    I wish you would wear my dress.  

		    I only wore it once, and you'll 

		    barely have to do anything to 

		    it except take it in in the 

		    bust --



				 BARBARA

		    I have something that might do 

		    --



	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER



	Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides 

	of cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room 

	Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas 

	carols.



	INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS



	MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to 

	burp.



	INT. ATTIC - NIGHT



	The sound of Christmas carols from below.



	The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with 

	her mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a 

	sheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful 

	antique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy.



				 BARBARA

		    The Historical Society wanted 

		    this and I never would give it 

		    to them --



				 ANNIE

		    Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.



				 BARBARA

		    I notice these things are back 

		    in fashion.  Oh, honey.

			   (tears are rolling down 

			    her face as she tries 

			    the veil on Annie)

		    He's a lovely man, Annie.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.  He's wonderful, isn't 

		    he?



				 BARBARA

		    Are his folks nice?



				 ANNIE

		    You'll love them.  We're going 

		    down to D.C.  tonight to be with 

		    them Christmas morning.



				 BARBARA

		    How did it happen?



	Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back 

	of the dress and remove it from the dummy.



				 ANNIE

		    It's silly, really.  I mean, 

		    I'd seen him at the office, 

		    obviously I'd seen him, he's 

		    the associate publisher, and 

		    then one day we both ordered 

		    sandwiches from the same place, 

		    and he got my lettuce and 

		    tomato sandwich on whole wheat, 

		    which of course he was allergic 

		    to, and I got his lettuce and 

		    tomato on white.



				 BARBARA

			   (utterly without irony)

		    How amazing.



				 ANNIE

		    It is, isn't it? You make 

		    millions of decisions that mean 

		    nothing and then one day you 

		    decide to order takeout and it 

		    changes your life.



				 BARBARA

		    Destiny takes a hand.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, please.  Destiny's just 

		    something we've invented 

		    because we can't stand the fact 

		    that everything that happens is 

		    accidental.



				 BARBARA

		    Then how do you explain that 

		    you both ordered exactly the 

		    same sandwich except for the 

		    bread? How many people in this 

		    world like lettuce and tomato 

		    without something else like 

		    tuna?



				 ANNIE

		    It wasn't a sign.  It was a 

		    coincidence.



	Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie 

	steps into it.



	Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.



				 BARBARA

		    I was in Atlantic City with my 

		    family.  Cliff was a waiter.  

		    He talked me into sneaking out 

		    for a midnight walk on the 

		    Steel Pier.  I've probably told 

		    you this a million times, but 

		    I don't care.  And then he held 

		    my hand.  I was scared.  All 

		    sorts of thing were going 

		    through my head.  But after a 

		    while I forgot about them.  At 

		    one point I looked down, at our 

		    hands, and I couldn't tell 

		    which fingers were mine and 

		    which were his.  And I knew.



				 ANNIE

			   (hearing it for the 

			    first time)

		    What?



				 BARBARA

		    You know.



				 ANNIE

			   (she doesn't know, but 

			    she doesn't want her 

			    mother to know she 

			    doesn't know)

		    What?



				 BARBARA

		    Magic.  It was magic.



				 ANNIE

			   (repeating)

		    Magic.



				 BARBARA

		    I knew we would be together 

		    forever, and that everything 

		    would be wonderful, just the 

		    way you feel about Walter.  

		    Walter.  It's quite a formal 

		    name, isn't it?

			   (lowering her voice)

		    One of the things I truly knew 

		    was that your father and I were 

		    going to have a wonderful time

		    ... in the sack I believe you 

		    call it --



				 ANNIE

		    Mom!



				 BARBARA

		    Of course it took several years 

		    before everything worked like 

		    clockwork in that department, 

		    so don't be worried if it takes 

		    a while --



				 ANNIE

		    Mom, we already...



				 BARBARA

		    Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da 

		    dee.  And how's it working?



				 ANNIE

		    Like... clockwork.



	She turns to look in the mirror.  The dress doesn't fit 

	at all.  It's completely lopsided.  One shoulder is 

	higher than the other.  The waist is in the wrong spot.  

	The effect is quite comical.



				 BARBARA

		    So you'll get married in a new 

		    dress.



				 ANNIE

		    It's a sign.



				 BARBARA

			   (gently)

		    You don't believe in signs.



	EXT. STREET - LATE



	The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on 

	the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.

		    did.



				 WALTER

		    I love you.



				 ANNIE

		    I love you, Walter.

			   (beat)

		    Did anyone ever call you 

		    anything other than Walter?



				 WALTER

		    Nope.



				 ANNIE

		    Even when you were young?



				 WALTER

		    Nope.  Not even when I was 

		    young.



	It's starting to rain.



				 WALTER

		    You sure you don't want to 

		    drive with me?



				 ANNIE

		    How will I get back to 

		    Baltimore Saturday?

			   (remembering something)

		    Oh God, I forgot my present for 

		    your stepmother -- I took it 

		    inside by accident.



				 WALTER

		    I'll wait.



				 ANNIE

		    Don't be silly.  I'll just be

	Annie driving.  Presents on the front seat.  She's

		    there, you sound younger than 

		    our usual callers.  How come 

		    you're up so late?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's not that late in Seattle.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Got me there.  What's your 

		    Christmas wish, Jonah?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's not for me.  It's for my 

		    dad.  I think he needs a new 

		    wife.



	Annie shakes her head.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    You don't like the one he was 

		    now?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    He doesn't have one now.  

		    That's the problem.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Where's your mom?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    She died.



	Annie closes her eyes for a moment.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't believe this --



	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



	As the car drives along.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I've been pretty sad, but I 

		    think my dad is worse.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    And you're worried about him.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I'm worried about him, he's 

		    worried about me, I ride my 

		    bike to school, he follows in 

		    the car, like I'm not supposed 

		    to know he's there.  Now it's 

		    Christmas, and you know what 

		    happens to people at Christmas.



				 ANNIE

		    They lose their minds and call 

		    crackpot doctors on the radio --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Have you talked to your dad 

		    about this?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    No.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    It's very hard for him to talk 

		    about this stuff.  It's like it 

		    makes him sadder.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    You want me to talk to him?



				 ANNIE

		    Perfect.  Sandbag the father.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    And you crazy? He thinks shows 

		    like this are dumb.  If you 

		    didn't have an 800 number I 

		    could never get away with this 

		    --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Is he home right now?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Yeah.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Well, I think I can help a 

		    little more if I talk to him 

		    directly.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    I don't know --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm sure he won't be angry once 

		    he realizes how concerned you 

		    are about him.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Okay, but if I get yelled at, 

		    I'm never gonna listen to this 

		    show again.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Fair enough.



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the 

	houseboat he lives in with Sam.  He's got the phone cord 

	coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's 

	standing near the kitchen end of a large living area 

	looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting 

	in a deck chair looking out at the sea.



				 JONAH

		    Dad --



				 SAM

		    What is it?



	ON ANNIE AGAIN.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    There's somebody on the phone 

		    for you.

			   (into phone)

		    His name is Sam.



				 ANNIE

		    This is completely disgusting.



	INT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam pokes his head in the back door.  He looks much as 

	he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is 

	a little longer.  He picks up the phone extension.



				 SAM

		    Hello.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone on Network America.



	Sam looks across the room to Jonah.



				 SAM

		    I'm probably not interested in 

		    whatever you're selling.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I'm not selling anything.  Your 

		    son called and asked for advice 

		    on how to find you a new wife.



				 SAM

			   (he really didn't get 

			    her name)

		    Who is this?



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

			   (repeating herself)

		    Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of 

		    Network America.



				 SAM

		    Jesus, are we on the air? 

		    Jonah, for God's sake --



				 JONAH

		    Don't be mad at me, Dad.



	Sam can see Jonah.  He's frightened.  Sam immediately 

	feels how upset Jonah is.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    He feels that since your wife's 

		    death you've been very unhappy. 

		    He's genuinely worried about you.



	Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's 

	standing on.



				 SAM

			   (to Jonah)

		    I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm 

		    not mad at you.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I think it's hard for him to 

		    talk to you about all this.  

		    Maybe we could talk and it 

		    would make him feel a little 

		    better.



	Sam hesitates.



				 JONAH

		    Please --



	INT. ANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT



				 ANNIE

		    This is a grotesque violation 

		    of this man's personal life, 

		    but never mind --



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    All righ...



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Good.  How long ago did your 

		    wife die?



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



				 SAM

		    It's been about a year and a 

		    half.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Have you had any relationship 

		    since?



				 SAM

		    No.



	Sam is very uncomfortable about this --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM

		    Look, Doctor, I don't want to 

		    be rude, but --



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    And I don't want to invade your 

		    privacy --



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



				 ANNIE

		    Sure you do.



				 SAM (V.O.)

			   (overlapping)

		    Sure you do --



	Annie smiles.



				 SAM

		    Look, we had a tough time at 

		    first, but I think I'm holding 

		    my own as a dad, and Jonah and 

		    I will get along fine again as 

		    soon as I break his radio.



	Annie laughs.  So does Mr.  Fieldstone



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is smiling too.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    I have no doubt that you're a 

		    good dad.  You can tell a lot 

		    from a person's voice.  But 

		    something must be missing if 

		    Jonah feels that you're still 

		    under a cloud.



				 JONAH

		    Tell her how you don't sleep at 

		    night.



				 SAM

		    How do you know that?



	Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally 

	talking to each other on the phone within their own 

	house, but also ON THE AIR.



				 JONAH

		    I can hear you walking around 

		    sometimes.  At first I thought 

		    it was a robber.  Go ahead, 

		    tell her, Dad.



				 SAM

		    I don't think I have to now.



	Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts 

	toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.  

	On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.



				 SAM

		    Look, it's almost Christmas --

			   (as the two of them sit 

			    down together on the 

			    bench)

		    A kid needs a mother --



	He puts an arm around Jonah.



	INT. CAR - NIGHT



	As Annie listens.  She's softened considerably.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Could it be that you need 

		    someone just as much as Jonah 

		    does?



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.



	Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm losing my mind.



	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



	As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    We've been talking to -- well, 

		    let's just call him Sleepless 

		    in Seattle, and we'll be right 

		    back after this break with 

		    listener response, your 

		    response, to the things we've 

		    been discussing.  The number to 

		    call is...



	INT. BALDWIN HOUSE



				 SAM

		    What's she talking about?



				 JONAH

		    This is where other people get 

		    to call in and dump on what you 

		    said.



	We hear the beginning of a commercial.



	INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT



	Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio 

	reverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee.  

	There's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS 

	LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a 

	TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook, 

	is visible through an open window to the kitchen.



				 LORETTA

		    I'll bet he's tall, with a cute 

		    butt.



				 HARRIET

		    I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a 

		    week.  I'll bet he stinks.



				 LORETTA

		    Shut up, Harriet.

			   (to Annie)

		    What'll it be?



				 ANNIE

		    Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.



				 LORETTA

		    Maybe I should hustle myself 

		    out to Seattle.  Give him a 

		    little present for New Year's 

		    Eve.



				 HARRIET

		    You can go there if you want 

		    but don't open his refrigerator.  

		    They don't cover anything when 

		    they put it in the fridge.  

		    They just stick it in and leave 

		    it there till it walks out by 

		    itself.



				 LORETTA

		    Harriet, ever since you 

		    divorced your last husband, 

		    you've been no fun.  I'm 

		    looking, and this guy pops my 

		    tarts.



				 TRUCK DRIVER

		    Come on, Loretta, you're going 

		    to have to jump-start this guy.  

		    His battery's dead.  And look 

		    at me.  Mister Ever-Ready.  

		    Every six minutes, another 

		    charge.



				 LORETTA

		    I'm looking for someone 

		    sensitive.



				 ANNIE

		    Come on, nobody wants a guy 

		    who's sensitive on the radio.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Let's take a call before we get 

		    back to Sleepless.  Knoxville, 

		    Tennessee, you're on.



				 SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE

		    Yes, I would just like to know 

		    where I could get this man's 

		    address?



				 LORETTA

			   (to the radio)

		    Honey, get on line.



	EXT. DINER - NIGHT



	As Annie gets into her car.



	EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C.  STREET - NIGHT



	Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents 

	live.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Do you think there's somebody 

		    out there you could love as 

		    much as your wife? Maybe even 

		    more?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    It's hard to imagine.



	And cut back and forth between the car and the 

	houseboat.  Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but 

	Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.  Sam is stroking 

	the boy's hair.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What are you going to do, Sam?



				 SAM

		    I don't know.  When I met my 

		    wife, it was so clear.  I just 

		    knew.



	Annie is listening now.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What was it that made you know?



				    SAM

		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM

		    And if I could describe it, 

		    it probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.

			   (continued)



	Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in 

	Washington, D.C., the motor running.  She's hooked now, 

	she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it 

	all.



				 SAM

		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like...



				 ANNIE

		    Magic.



				 SAM

		    Magic.



	CLOSER ON ANNIE



	realizing she has just said this.  Realizing that it 

	must mean something but not knowing what.



	SHE'S CRYING.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Well, it's time to wrap up, 

		    folks --



	A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which 

	Annie doesn't notice.  She's wiping the tears away with 

	her hand.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    We hope you'll call again soon.



	The figure TAPS on the window --



				 WALTER

			   (muffled, outside car)

		    Annie?



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

	    	    ... and let us know how it's 

	    	    going.



	-- and taps again.



				 WALTER

		    Annie?



	She turns.  He's pointing at the locked door.  She 

	searches for the button.  Finally finds it so that 

	Walter can open the door.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm sorry, Walter.  I just 

		    heard the most amazing thing on 

		    the radio.



	They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie 

	carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.



				 ANNIE

		    People call up these shows and 

		    you can't believe the stuff 

		    they say.  It's the end of 

		    privacy as we know it, this 

		    country is just one big global 

		    village with everyone out there 

		    going blah blah blah --



	As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see 

	a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.



							CUT TO:



	A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS



	as we pull back to reveal:



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY MORNING



	As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut 

	from gift to gift:



	A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and 

	which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing 

	to open:



	A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his 

	neck.



	A PLAID SHIRT



	A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in 

	schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller.



	And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind 

	the door and Jonah opens --



	A NEW FISHING ROD



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



	As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his 

	tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new 

	plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam 

	takes his picture.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY (OR POSSIBLY EXT. DECK HOUSEBOAT)



	Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he 

	made in woodworking class.



				 SAM

		    The hopes are perfect -- 

		    beautiful, identical, smooth -- 

		    and they are for something 

		    really amazing I feel it in my 

		    bones --



				 JONAH

		    It's a spice rack.



				 SAM

		    We desperately need a spice 

		    rack.  Desperately.



							CUT TO:



	INT. KITCHEN OF HOUSEBOAT - DAY



				 SAM

		    And we desperately need spices.



	Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper, 

	salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which 

	has room for at least twenty more.  Jonah is 

	methodically making pancakes.



				 JONAH

		    Dad?  About last night?



				 SAM

		    It's never happening again.  

		    Right?



				 JONAH

		    Right.



	There's a knock on the door.



				 SAM

		    Then it never happened.



	Sam goes to answer the door.



	TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.  Both are wearing 

	quite a lot of Spandex.  One of them is named LULU.  It 

	says so on her jacket.  The other is JOBETH.



				 SAM

		    Hi.



				 LULU

		    Hi.  Sam?



				 SAM

		    Yes?



				 LULU

			   (looking in and seeing 

			       Jonah)

		    You must be Jonah.



	Jonah nods.



				 LULU

			   (to her friend)

		    See.  I told you.  Sam and 

		    Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is 

		    JoBeth.



	JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.



				 LULU

			   (continues)

		    We live two piers over, don't 

		    we? Number 12, right? We're 

		    having like a really neat open 

		    house today from like four to 

		    whenever if you care to stop 

		    by.



				 SAM

		    Thanks, but... we've got plans.



				 LULU

		    Well, here's the number.  If 

		    you ever find yourself 

		    Sleepless, give us a call.  We 

		    also... do babysitting.



	She winks.  JoBeth nods.



	Sam nods.



	Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down 

	the dock.



	Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.



				 JONAH

		    Not.



				 SAM

		    My feelings exactly.



	EXT. LAKE UNION MARINA - EARLY MORNING



	Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.



				 SAM

		    How many people do you think 

		    heard that thing last night?



				 JONAH

		    It plays in 50 states.



				 SAM

		    What?!



				 JONAH

		    Nobody else is going to know it 

		    was us.



				 SAM

		    You're right.

			   (after a beat)

		    You better hope so.



	EXT. BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING



	INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY



	A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at 

	computers.  Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned 

	offices and meeting rooms.  Inside one of the offices is 

	BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.  She's at a 

	table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and 

	two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.  Wyatt is 

	playing Gameboy.



				 KEITH

		    This man sells the greatest 

		    soup you've ever eaten, there's 

		    a line around the block, and he 

		    is, I am not kidding, the meanest 

		    man in America.

			   (beat)

		    I feel strongly about this, 

		    Becky.  This is not just about 

		    soup.



				 BECKY

		    Do it.  What else?



				 WYATT

		    New Year's Eve.  Please don't 

		    make me write it.



	Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.



				 BECKY

		    Wyatt, I do not mean to remind 

		    you of your mother, but if you 

		    don't put that game away, no TV 

		    for a week.



				 WYATT

			   (pushing it to the 

			    center of the table)

		    Would someone look this up, 

		    don't tell me where.



	Becky is riffling through some papers on the table, 

	among which are some tearsheets from the Associated 

	Press wire.



				 BECKY

		    Listen to this.  Phone service 

		    in the greater Chicago area was 

		    tied up for two hours Christmas 

		    Eve because some kid called a 

		    phone-in show to get a wife for 

		    his father.  Two thousand women 

		    called in for the number.



				 KEITH

		    Jesus.



				 ANNIE

		    I heard it.  This kid calls up 

		    and says my dad needs a wife 

		    and I'm talking to myself in 

		    the car saying, this is 

		    completely disgusting, you're 

		    taking advantage of a child, 

		    and then the father gets on and 

		    this shrinkette says, do you 

		    want to talk about it? And he 

		    says no as a matter of fact I 

		    don't, and I am saying, bravo! 

		    Right on! Don't talk to her, 

		    it's none of her business --

			   (she's completely into 

			    this story now)

		    -- and then suddenly, for no 

		    reason at all, he's talking 

		    about how much he loved his 

		    wife, and how he just --

			   (she snaps her fingers)

		    fell in love with her and I am 

		    crying.  Me.  A tear is 

		    actually rolling down my face.  

		    It was like what happens when I 

		    watch those phone company ads.  

		    I don't have to see the whole 

		    ad, I just have to see the part 

		    where the daughter gives her 

		    mother a refrigerator with a 

		    big red bow on it, have you 

		    seen that one?



	Everyone looks at her.  Apparently she's finished.



				 BECKY

		    You should write something 

		    about this.



				 ANNIE

		    About what?



				 BECKY

		    Whatever it is.



				 KEITH

			   (waving the AP story)

		    What it is is, there are a lot 

		    of desperate women out there 

		    looking for love.



				 WYATT

		    Especially over a certain age.



	Annie is looking at them.  This isn't what she was 

	talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what 

	she was talking about.



				 KEITH

		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist after the age of 40 

		    than it is to get married --



				 ANNIE

		    That is not true.  That 

		    statistic is not true.



				 BECKY

		    It's not true, but it feels 

		    true.



				 ANNIE

		    There's practically a whole 

		    book about how that statistic 

		    is not true --



				 WYATT

		    Calm down.  You brought it up --



				 ANNIE

			   (sharply)

		    I did not, Wyatt.



	A beat, everyone pauses.  Things are a little out of 

	hand.



				 BECKY

		    So where were we?



				 WYATT

		    New Year's Eve.  I'll do it, 

		    okay?



				 BECKY

		    Okay.



				 ANNIE

		    If someone is a widower, why do 

		    they say he was widowed? Why 

		    don't they say he was widowered?



	Everyone looks at her strangely.



				 ANNIE

		    I was jus wondering.



	EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY



	Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying 

	to catch up.



				 BECKY

		    What was that about up there?



				 ANNIE

		    What was what?



				 BECKY

		    What's with you?



				 ANNIE

		    Nothing's with me.



	INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY



	Becky and Annie are having lunch.



				 BECKY

		    "Sleepless in Seattle"?



				 ANNIE

		    That's what she called him on 

		    the show.  Because he can't 

		    sleep.



				 BECKY

		    And now 2,000 women want his 

		    number.  The guy could be a 

		    crackhead, a psychopath, a 

		    flasher, a junkie, a 

		    transvestite, a chain-saw 

		    murderer, or someone really 

		    sick, like Rick.



				 ANNIE

		    Actually, he sounded nice.



				 BECKY

		    Oh? Oh, really? Now we're 

		    getting down to it.



				 ANNIE

		    Not.



	She reaches down for her purse.



	INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY



	A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle 

	newspaper, and



	PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



	Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old 

	house that's being renovated.  Jonah, who is playing 

	Cameboy, is walking along with him.  WORKMEN are active 

	everywhere.  Dry wall going up, cabinets being 

	installed, tile being set.



	One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him, 

	and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for 

	them in an unfinished doorframe.  Bob is hefty, older, 

	always eating something dietetic.  Jay is younger and 

	always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.



				 BOB LANGMAN

		    Now she wants a circular 

		    stairwell off the den.



				 JAY

			   (to Jonah, in b.g.)

		    Punch me, punch in right here.

			   (points to his stomach;

			    Jonah punches)

		    And she wants the Sub-Zero with 

		    the side-by-side doors --



				 BOB

		    Which means --



				 SAM

		    The cabinets have to be redone 

		    --



	They all nod at each other.  The woman has been a 

	nightmare.



				 BOB

		    So we thought --



				 JAY

		    Since you're on the make again 

		    --



	Sam looks at Jonah --



				 SAM

		    Great.  This is great.  The 

		    whole town knows.  Just out of 

		    curiosity, how do you two know?



				 BOB

		    Grace heard it.



				 SAM

		    Grace the dispatcher.  Great.



				 BOB

		    The point is, take the client 

		    out to dinner and ask her to 

		    marry you and then maybe we 

		    won't have to redo the kitchen 

		    cabinets.



				 SAM

		    Why me? What about Jay?



				 JAY

		    Hey, my plate is full.



				 SAM

		    Well, okay.  What's the big 

		    deal?  If she'll forget the 

		    new fireplace, I'll marry her.  

		    Just point me in the right 

		    direction.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, I don't know about this 

		    one --



				 SAM

		    Oh, you're changing your mind 

		    --



				 JONAH

		    No, I'm not, but --



				 SAM

		    What's the matter with this 

		    one? Wouldn't you like to have 

		    Imelda Marcos as your mother?



				 JONAH

		    Dad --



	Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.



				 SAM

		    We better take the measurements 

		    for the new cabinets.



	He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.  and 

	starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in 

	another area of the site.  Bob follows after him.  Jay 

	tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into 

	the wall.



				 BOB

		    Sam, if you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- 

		    obviously you're not doing 

		    anything New Year's -- we're 

		    having some people over, all of 

		    them married, not one even 

		    remotely interested in playing 

		    around.  Does that sound great 

		    or what?

			   (whistfully)

		    I can't think of the last time 

		    I was at a party when anything 

		    actually happened.



				 SAM

		    Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's 

		    kind of a big night.  I don't 

		    like to leave Jonah alone.



							CUT TO:



	SHOT OF  HOUSEBOAT BEING TOWED BY A TUG DOWN THE RIVER (OR A 

	SEAPLANE LANDING) - TWILIGHT



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - TWILIGHT



	Jonah watching it.  Sam visible in the distance in the 

	kitchen.



	INT. KITCHEN - TWILIGHT



	As Sam is busy installing the spice rack.  He marks the 

	wall, hammers in the nails, etc.



				 SAM

			   (as he starts putting 

			    new spices into the 

			    rack, in alphabetical 

			    order)

		    Does red pepper go under R or 

		    P?



				 JONAH

		    P.

			   (beat)

		    Dad?



				 SAM

			   (absently)

		    What?



				 JONAH

		    I forgot to mention.  Jed 

		    called --



				 SAM

		    Just out of curiosity, do you 

		    have any friends whose names 

		    don't begin with a J?  I feel 

		    like it was a failure of the 

		    imagination on our part naming 

		    you Jonah.

		  	   (looking at the spices)

		    What is marjoram? Does anyone 

		    know?



				 JONAH

		    Jed is having a slumber party 

		    New Year's Eve and he invited 

		    me.



	A beat.



				 SAM

		    Fine.  Fine.



				 JONAH

		    So I can go.



				 SAM

		    Sure.

			   (almost done with the 

			    spices)

		    Looking good.



				 JONAH

		    Shouldn't you have used a 

		    toggle bolt?



				 SAM

		    I think I know how to have a 

		    spice rack.



	He puts in the last spice.



	They stand back to admire it.  A beat.  The rack falls 

	off the wall.



	The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the 

	glass jars of spices break.



	There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc.  all 

	over the floor along with shards of glass.



				 SAM

	    	    God fucking dammit!  Shit! 

	    	    Fuck.  Piss.



	Jonah bursts into tears.



				 SAM

			   (still angry)

		    I'm sorry.

			   (softening)

		    I'm sorry.



	He picks up Jonah and holds him.



				 SAM

		    I'm sorry.  I'm just --



				 JONAH

		    Stressed.



				 SAM

		    Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm 

		    sorry.



	And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.  Sam closes his 

	eyes tight.



	INT. A TELEVISION SET OF NEW YEAR'S EVE ON TIMES SQUARE



	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam, alone, watching the ball drop.  He's got a bag of 

	Doritos and a beer.



				 A VOICE

		    Can I have half your beer?



				 SAM

		    Sure.



	It's Maggie.



	She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a 

	glass.



				 MAGGIE

		    What did I used to say? Here's 

		    looking at you? Here's mud in 

		    your eye?



				 SAM

		    Here's to us.  You used to say 

		    here's to us.

			   (he looks at her and 

			    his eyes well with 

			    tears)

		    Oh babe.  I miss you so much it 

		    hurts.



	He reaches out for her.  She's gone.



	And we hear the television set now counting down to 

	midnight in New York.



							CUT TO:



	INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT



	The same television show counting down to midnight.



	Champagne corks popping, etc.



	And we see Walter and Annie.



				 WALTER

		    Happy New Year, darling.



				 ANNIE

		    Happy New Year.



	They start to dance.



				 WALTER

		    I was thinking, I have to go up 

		    to Boston for the AAP 

		    convention and then visit 

		    Winston-Hughes about switching 

		    over our computers.  Why don't 

		    we meet in New York for 

		    Valentine's Day weekend?



				 ANNIE

		    Walter, I'd love to --



				 WALTER

		    We'll stay at the Plaza --



				 ANNIE

		    Go for a walk in Central Park --



				 WALTER

		    Go to the Symphony --



	A beat.



				 ANNIE

		    We will?

			   (beat)

		    The Symphony?

			   (beat)

		    Okay.

			   (beat)

		    I'll take you to the Russian 

		    Tea Room for pelmeni.


				 WALTER

		    What is it?



				 ANNIE

		    It's delicious, trust me.



				 WALTER

		    Does it have wheat in it?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't think so.



	They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where 

	everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, 

	looks thoughtful.



	ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY



	Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward 

	his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries.



	In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



	Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over 

	his face.



	A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the 

	front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt 

	for the mail.



				 JONAH

		    Look at this, Dad.  They're 

		    all for you --



	Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's 

	addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia 

	Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's 

	stunned.  As he signs the receipt:



				 MAILMAN

		    If you're having trouble 

		    sleeping, you might want to try 

		    drinking a glass of water from 

		    the other side.



				 JONAH

		    I thought that was for hiccups.



				 MAILMAN

		    Does it work for hiccups?



				 JONAH

		    For hiccups, a spoonful of 

		    sugar, you hold it in your 

		    mouth for a minute.



				 MAILMAN

		    Really?



	The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the door.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting 

	at the table, reading the letters from the stack they 

	found by the door.



				 SAM

		    Just out of curiosity, how did 

		    they get our address?



				 JONAH

		    They called and asked for it.

			   (reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle.  

		    You are the most attractive man 

		    I've ever laid ears on."



	Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of 

	rejects, opens another.



				 SAM

		    How did they get our phone 

		    number?



				 JONAH

		    You have to give them your 

		    phone number or they won't let 

		    you go on the air.



	Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.



				 JONAH

			   (continues, reading)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    am an SWF"--

			   (to Sam)

		    What is that?



				 SAM

		    Thank God.  Something you don't 

		    know.  It's a single white 

		    female.



				 JONAH

		    This is no good.  She's looking 

		    for someone French.  Or Greek.

			   (puzzled, he throws the 

			    letter into the reject 

			    pile, opens another)

		    "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

		    live in Tulsa." Where is that? 

		    --



				 SAM

		    Oklahoma.  Do you know where 

		    that is?



				 JONAH

		    Somewhere in the middle.



				 SAM

		    I'm not going to think about 

		    what they're not teaching you 

		    in school.  I am not going to 

		    think about it.

			      (beat)

		    Generally speaking I think we 

		    should rule out people who 

		    don't live somewhere near here 

		    --



				 JONAH

		    She's willing to fly anywhere.



	As Jonah hands Sam the picture.



				 SAM

		    She looks like my third grade 

		    teacher.  I hated my third 

		    grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait 

		    a minute! She is my third 

		    grade teacher!



				 JONAH

		    Dad, you're not taking this 

		    seriously.



				 SAM

		    This is not how you do it.

			   (referring to the 

			    hamburger)

		    You want this on an English 

		    muffin or a bun?



				 JONAH

		    English muffin.  How do you do 

		    it?



				 SAM

		    You see someone you like, you 

		    get a feeling about them, you 

		    ask them if they want to have a 

		    drink or --



				 JONAH

		    -- a slice of pizza --



				 SAM

		    But not dinner necessarily on 

		    the first date because by the 

		    time you're halfway through 

		    dinner you might be sorry you 

		    asked them to dinner whereas if 

		    it's just a drink, if you like 

		    them you can always ask them 

		    for dinner but if you don't you 

		    can go home if you see what I 

		    mean.

			      (beat)

		    I wonder if it still works this 

		    way.



				 JONAH

		    It doesn't.  They ask you.



				 SAM

		    I'm starting to notice that.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter are making love.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    If you get a new wife, I guess 

		    you'll have sex with her, huh?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    What do you think?



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    Will she scratch up your back?



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    What?



	JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.  Jonah is holding his teddy 

	bear while this conversation concludes.



				 JONAH

		    In the movies women are always 

		    scratching up guy's back and 

		    screaming and stuff.  When 

		    they're having sex.



				 SAM

		    Whose show was this on?



				 JONAH

		    Jed's got cables.



				 SAM

		    Go to sleep.



	He kisses him good-night.



				 JONAH

		    Kiss Howard.

			   (he holds out the 

			    teddy bear)

		    G'night, Howard.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter have just finished making love.



	Walter falling asleep.



	Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open.



	She starts to get out of bed.  Puts on a robe.



	INT. STAIRWAY - HOUSE



	As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe.



	She opens the door to the street.



	EXT. STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie starts to run down the street.



	CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING



	And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running 

	down.



	Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.



	Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.



	And another: Your feet are cold.



	And another: Will you find love.



	And another: Before you're cold?



	And another: Burma Shave.



	And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running 

	across a map of the United States -- it's a little like 

	the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's 

	like the famous map of the United States by Saul 

	Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one 

	is about Seattle.



	In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two 

	indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start 

	to wave at her, very slowly.



	Annie's eyes widen.



							CUT TO:



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Annie in bed, eyes open.  Walter fast asleep.



	She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did 

	in the dream sequence).



	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT



	As Annie comes down the stairs.



	INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE



	She turns the light on.



	Opens the refrigerator.



	Closes it.



	Opens it again.  Takes out some milk.



	Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes, 

	banana.  She's about to assemble it when:



	She sees:



	THE RADIO



	She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia 

	Fieldstone is on.  She sits back down with her corn 

	flakes.



				 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

		    Up next, "You and Your 

		    Emotions" with Dr.  Marcia 

		    Fieldstone, clinical 

		    psychologist and the best 

		    friend you never had.

			   (the teaser continues)



				 WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

		He says he doesn't love me any 

		more.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why do you want to be with 

		    someone who doesn't love you?



				 ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.)

		    Every time I come close to 

		    orgasm he stops and goes to 

		    make himself a sandwich --

	

				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why don't you make him a 

		    sandwich beforehand?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    When I met my wife, it was so 

		    clear.  I jus knew.



	Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    What was it that made you know?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    I don't think I could really 

		    describe it.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Why not?



				 SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

		    And if I could describe it, it 

		    probably wouldn't be on a radio 

		    show.

			   (he laughs to himself)

		    But what the hell.  It's not 

		    one specific thing.  It's more 

		    of a feeling.  

			      (continuing)

		    You touch her for the first 

		    time, and suddenly... you're 

		    home.  It's almost like... 

		    magic.



	Annie closes her eyes.



				 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

		    We'll be back after this 

		    commercial with Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone.



	EXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



	We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the 

	Peabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car.



	INT. LIBRARY - DAY



	As Annie strides purposefully across the library and 

	enters:



	INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY



	Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his 

	desk.  We barely has time to look up.



				 ANNIE

		    I think I'm going crazy, Tom.  

		    I really do.  Are you happily 

		    married?



				 TOM

			   (completely panicked by 

			    the question)

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    I mean, why did you get 

		    married? Was it all fireworks 

		    and trumpets and --



				 TOM

			   (regaining composure)

		    I got married because Betsy 

		    said we had to break up or get 

		    married.  So we get married.



				 ANNIE

		    But when you met her, did you 

		    believe she was the only person 

		    for you? That in some mystical, 

		    cosmic way, it was fated?



				 TOM

		    Annie, when you meet someone 

		    and you're attracted to them, 

		    it just means that your 

		    subconscious is attracted to 

		    their subconscious, 

		    subconsciously.  So what we 

		    think of as chemistry is just 

		    two neuroses knowing that they 

		    are a perfect match.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't even know him.  But 

		    I'm having all these fantasies 

		    about a man I've never met, 

		    who lives in Seattle.



				 TOM

		    It rains nine months of the 

		    year in Seattle.



				 ANNIE

		    I know, I know.  I do not want 

		    to move to Seattle.  But what I 

		    really don't want to do is end 

		    up always wondering what might 

		    have happened and knowing I 

		    could have done something.  

		    What do you think?

			   (Tom opens his mouth to 

			    say something, but 

			    before anything comes 

			    out, Annie fills the 

			    void)

		    It's just cold feet, isn't it? 

		    Everyone panics before they get 

		    married, didn't you?



				 TOM

		    Yes, I did.



				 ANNIE

		    Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much 

		    better just having blown this 

		    off.



				 TOM

		    Any time.



	INT. PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



	As Annie walks through it and pushes the door to exit.



	EXT. A DOOR OPENING TO SEATTLE STREET - DAY



	Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the 

	street.



				 JAY

		    Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda

		    ... She's a weightlifter, but 

		    it's not like her neck is 

		    bigger than her head or 

		    anything --



				 SAM

		    I'm not asking you to set me 

		    up, Jay.  That's not what I 

		    need your help for.  I want to 

		    know what it's like over there.



				 JAY

		    And that's what I'm trying to 

		    tell you.  What women are 

		    looking over, okay? Pecs and a 

		    cute butt.



				 SAM

		    You mean, like, "He has the 

		    cutest butt"? Where did I hear 

		    that recently?



				 JAY

		    Everywhere.  You can't even 

		    turn on the news without 

		    hearing about how some babe 

		    thought some guy's butt was 

		    cute.  Who the first babe to 

		    say this was I don't know, 

		    but it caught on.



	INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - DAY



	Sam and Jay at the counter.  Out the window, we can see 

	water.



				 JAY

		    When's the latest time you were 

		    out there?



				 SAM

			   (trying to remember)

		    Seventy... eight.



				 JAY

		    Well.  Things are different.  

		    First, you have to be friends.  

		    You have to like each other.  

		    Then you neck.  This can go on 

		    for years.  Then you have 

		    tests.  Then you get to do it 

		    with a condom.

			   (beat)

		    The good news is, split the 

		    check.



				 SAM

		    I don't think it could let a 

		    woman pay for dinner.



				 JAY

		    Great.  They'll have a parade 

		    in your honor.  You'll be Man 

		    of the Year in Seattle 

		    Magazine.  Tira misu.



				 SAM

		    What's tira misu?



				 JAY

		    You'll find out.



				 SAM

		    What is it?



				 JAY

		    You'll see.



				 SAM

		    Some woman is going to want me 

		    to do it to her and I'm not 

		    going to know what it is.



				 JAY

		    You'll like it.



				 SAM

			   (grimly)

		    This is going to be tougher 

		    than I thought.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



	Sam coming home.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



	As he enters.  It's very quiet.  Too quiet.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	No answers.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	He starts to look concerned.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.  The door is 

	shut.  He opens it.



	Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape.  

	Earphones on.  Next to him is a young girl named 

	JESSICA.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?



	Jonah takes off the earphones.



				 JONAH

		    Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.



				 SAM

		    It's nice to meet you, Jessica.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, this is amazing.  If you 

		    play this backwards, it says 

		    "Paul is dead."



				 SAM

		    I know.



				 JONAH

		    How do you know?



	Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, could you close the door?



				 JESSICA

		    H and G.

			   (Sam looks back)

		    Hi and goodbye.



	Sam closes the door to Jonah's room.



	Hold on Sam.



				 SAM

			   (to himself)

		    Get a life.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS



	As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office.  Closes

	INT. SAM'S OFFICE AT HOME - CONTINUOUS



	He goes to the phone.  Looks up a number in the phone 

	book.  Picks up the phone and dials a number.



				 SAM

		    Hi, Victoria?... It's Sam 

		    Baldwin, I don't know if you 

		    remember me.  Oh?  Well, great.  

		    I was wondering if you wanted 

		    to have a drink... Friday, 

		    say... Dinner?... Sure, dinner 

		    would be fine.  Sure.  Dinner.



	INT. AN UNFINISHED DINNER ON A PLATE IN ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM 

	- NIGHT



	Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, 

	tears pouring down her face.  Cary Grant is saying: "Are 

	you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not 

	now."



	She's sitting at the dining room table.  A dozen pieces 

	of paper litter the table.  Annie's been unsuccessfully 

	typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.



				 ANNIE

		    Now those were the days when 

		    people knew how to be in love.



	She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.  

	Becky leans in, refilling the glass.  Annie begins to 

	type and sob and look at the TV.



				 BECKY

		    You're a basket case.



				 ANNIE

			   (as she types)

		    They knew it.  Time, distance, 

		    nothing could separate them.  

		    Because they knew.  It was 

		    right.  It was real.  It was...



				 BECKY

		    ... movie.

			   (beat)

		    That's your problem.  You don't 

		    want to be in love.  You want 

		    to be in love in a movie.

			   (beat)

		    Read it to me.



				 ANNIE

			   (reading her letter)

		    "Dear Sleepless and Son..."



				 BECKY

		    It sounds like the name of a 

		    mattress store --



				 ANNIE

		    "I am not the sort of person 

		    who listens to call-in radio 

		    shows" --



	Becky flops on the couch.



				 BECKY

		    And this woman is a writer! 

		    That's what everyone writes at 

		    the beginning of letters to 

		    strangers.



				 ANNIE

		    I know that.  You think I don't 

		    know that? "I know that's a 

		    dumb way to begin, but it's the 

		    only way I can think of to 

		    convey what happened to me the 

		    other night when I heard the 

		    two of you on the radio.  On 

		    the other hand, maybe I'm just 

		    losing my mind."



				 BECKY

		    You are.  You're losing your 

		    mind.  What about Walter?



				 ANNIE

		    I'm going to marry Walter.  I 

		    just have to get this out of my 

		    system.



				 BECKY

		    Right.



				 ANNIE

		    I should say something in this 

		    about magic.



				 BECKY

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know.  I mean, what if 

		    I never meet him? What if this 

		    man is my destiny and I never 

		    meet him?



				 BECKY

		    Your destiny can be your doom.  

		    Look at me and Rick.



				 ANNIE

			   (typing some more)

		    "I want to meet you..."



	Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State 

	Building?"



				 BECKY

		    "On top of the Empire State 

		    Building at sunset on 

		    Valentine's Day."



				 ANNIE

		    Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New 

		    York with Walter, I can squeeze 

		    it in.



	She types in Becky's idea.



	Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter, 

	smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and 

	into Becky's lap.



				 BECKY

		    You want to hear about destiny? 

		    If my husband hadn't gone on a 

		    diet, which caused me to leave 

		    him, I would never have been on 

		    that flight to Miami, and met 

		    Rick, and ended up having sex 

		    in the bathroom of a 727 with 

		    that nob you slide that says 

		    "vacant-occupied, vacant-

		    occupied, vacant-occupied" --

			   (she shudders in 

			    ecstasy, then pulls 

			    herself together)



				 ANNIE

		    You never told me you left your 

		    husband because he went on a 

		    diet.



				 BECKY

			   (nods; after a beat)

		    He lost all the weight... 

		    there.



				 ANNIE

		    That's impossible.  A guy can't 

		    --



				 BECKY

		    Can too.



				 ANNIE

		    No.



				 BECKY

		    Yes.



				 ANNIE

		    And then you left him? He lost 

		    weight there and you left him?



				 BECKY

		    Plus he fell in love with a 

		    temp.



				 ANNIE

		    Listen to this, I love this 

		    part --



	Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never." And Cary Grant 

	says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." 

	Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no 

	warm memories."



	Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces.



				 BECKY

		    Men never get this movie.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.



				 BECKY

		    Do you think at the end of the 

		    movie when she's in the 

		    wheelchair they can still do 

		    it?



				 ANNIE

		    I always wondered about that 

		    too.



	As Becky reaches for a Kleenex.



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM



	A Kleenex being pulled from a box.  Sam is giving it to 

	Jonah, who's up.  His hair is mated with perspiration.



				 SAM

		    It's okay, it's okay.  I'm 

		    here.



	A beat while Jonah calms down.



				 JONAH

		    It was sinking.



				 SAM

		    What was?



				 JONAH

		    Our house.  There was water 

		    coming in all the windows.



				 SAM

			   (calm and definite)

		    You're worried we're going to 

		    be all right.  We're going to 

		    be all right.

			   (Sam gives Jonah a 

			    squeeze)

		    I remember sometimes you'd have 

		    nightmares as a baby.  Your mom 

		    would hold you and rock you and 

		    sing you a song.



				 JONAH

		    Bye bye blackbird.



				 SAM

		    Is that what she used to sing?



				 JONAH

		    I miss her.

			   (beat)

		    What do you think happens to 

		    someone after they die?



				 SAM

		    I don't know.



				 JONAH

		    Like do you believe in heaven?



				 SAM

		    I never did.  Or the whole idea 

		    of an afterlife.  But I don't 

		    know any more.  I have these 

		    dreams about... your mom... and 

		    we have long talks about... 

		    about you, and how you are, 

		    which she sort of knows but I 

		    tell her anyway.  So what is 

		    that? It's sort of an afterlife, 

		    isn't it?



				 JONAH

		    I'm starting to forget her.



				 SAM

		    I know.  But she's here, Jonah.  

		    Because I have you.  And as 

		    long as I have you, I have your 

		    Mom.



	Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye 

	Blackbird.



				 SAM

		    I... uh... have a date with 

		    someone Friday night.



				 JONAH

		    Good.



	A beat.



				 SAM

		    Did I ever tell you about the 

		    time I ate a dog biscuit?



	As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK 

	FROM THE BED AND...



							CUT TO:



	EXT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT



	AS MUSIC CONTINUES.  Annie waves as Becky gets into her 

	car and rides away.  Annie turns to her doorway and 

	stops.  She can't go back in.  She needs to walk and 

	think.  She crosses the street into a little 

	neighborhood park.  We can see the moon.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Sam comes out onto the porch.  Flops down in his deck 

	chair.  The city lights in the background.  Same moon.  

	The MUSIC CONTINUES.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. PARK - NIGHT



	Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park.  

	MUSIC CONTINUES.



							CUT TO:



	CLOSE ON SAM



	CLOSE ON ANNIE



	AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING



	As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled 

	out of.  Annie starts toward him.



	A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT



	Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late 

	tonight, blackbird, bye bye.



	FADE IN:



	INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY



	Annie on the phone at her desk.



				 ANNIE

		    Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'm 

		    fine.  Listen, I'm doing an 

		    article on call-in radio shows.  

		    Do you know anyone who works 

		    for someone named Dr. Marcia 

		    Fieldstone...?



							CUT TO:



	Annie on the phone.



				 ANNIE

		    I'm a writer for the Baltimore 

		    Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie 

		    Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece 

		    on how people handle 

		    bereavement and I understand 

		    that you had a caller the other 

		    night... I know you're not 

		    supposed to, but Laurie said 

		    you might, and I'll plug the 

		    show and everything --

			   (she winces in 

			    anticipation of a 

			    rejection, but then 

			    her face relaxes)



							CUT TO:



	Annie dialing Sam's telephone number.



				 JONAH (ON MACHINE)

		    This is Jonah Baldwin, we're 

		    not in right now but you can 

		    leave --



	Annie hangs up.



				 ANNIE

		    Baldwin.



							CUT TO:



	Annie at her computer modem.  She's dialing a number.  

	We hear some beeps.

	A PRINTOUT OF AN ARTICLE



	that Annie's reading.  There's a newspaper picture of 

	Sam at the dedication of a building site.  It's got that 

	kind of grainy quality that things have when they've 

	been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good 

	looks.



	EXT. BO'S SECURITIES/WORLDWIDE - DAY



	Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in 

	downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse.  

	Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance-

	chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner.



	The sign on the door reads: "No job too small." "All 

	major credit cards accepted." And then everything on 

	the sign is translated into Spanish.



	INT. BO'S SECURITIES - DAY



	Detective Bo Wheedle, a former cop, sits at his desk 

	listening to Annie.  He has some papers.



				 ANNIE

		    I need to know about him 

		    because... he's involved with 

		    my sister...



			    	 DET. WHEEDLE

		    Okay.



				 ANNIE

		    She has a pattern of getting 

		    involved with losers... Once 

		    she almost ran away with a 

		    human cannonball from the 

		    circus.



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    Do you want a matrimonial, past 

		    wives, any kids--



				 ANNIE

		    No, I know that part --



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    So you want a financial, is he 

		    a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --



				 ANNIE

		    No, no, no, it's more like, who 

		    is he, does he have a sense of 

		    humor, is he nice -- no forget 

		    nice, I've got nice --



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    A sense of humor.



				 ANNIE

		    I'll tell you the truth, I 

		    heard this guy on a call-in 

		    radio show and I might not 

		    marry the person I should marry 

		    because I've become obsessed 

		    with him.



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that 

		    movie.



				 ANNIE

		    No.  Not remotely.  I just want 

		    to find out about him.



				 DET. WHEEDLE

		    You want a tail.

			   (picking up the phone)

		    I got a guy in Seattle --



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah is watching Geraldo with his babysitter, CLARISE, 

	17.

	Geraldo is talking to a heavily made-up, sexily-dressed 

	WOMAN.



				 GERALDO

		    So how long have you been a 

		    woman?



				 WOMAN

			   (husky voice)

		    About two weeks.



	Sam is coming down the stairs.



				 CLARISE

			   (to Jonah)

		    Pssst!



	Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to 

	the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed 

	for his date.



				 SAM

		    Clarise, I'll be back by 

		    midnight I'm sure --



				 CLARISE

		    Whenever.



	Sam tosses Jonah a letter.



				 SAM

		    This one's for both of us.



				 JONAH

			   (reading from the 

			    envelope)

		    Sleepless and Son.

			   (reading the postmark)

		    Baltimore.



	He starts to open the letter.



				 SAM

		    I left the number of the 

		    restaurant I'll be at if 

		    there's any emergency.



				 CLARISE

		    Fine.



				 SAM

			   (to Jonah)

		    How do I look?



				 JONAH

			   (absently)

		    Great.



				 SAM

			   (looks in mirror)

		    I look stupid.  I look stupid, 

		    don't I? I look like I'm 

		    trying too hard.  I was going 

		    to get a haircut but then I 

		    thought I'd look like I just 

		    got a haircut.

			   (checks his teeth, 

			    peers up his nose)



				 JONAH

			   (reading the letters)

		    This is a good letter, Dad.



				 SAM

			   (checks his fly, looks 

			    down at his feet)

		    The heels on these shoes are 

		    very large.  Why have I never 

		    noticed this? The heels on 

		    these shoes are grotesque.



				 JONAH

		    Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.



				 SAM

		    Now I'm late.  Bye.



	He starts toward the door.



				 JONAH

		    Listen to this --



				 SAM

		    Not now, Jonah --



				 JONAH

		    Just this one part, okay?

			   (reading)

		    "I have been an excellent 

		    third-baseman for as long as I 

		    or anyone else can remember, 

		    and I guarantee you will not 

		    get one past me"



				 SAM

		    Jonah, I'm leaving --



				 JONAH

		    WAIT!!!

			   (Sam stops, amazed at 

			    Jonah's vehemence; 

			    Jonah continues 

			    reading)

		    -- "and while we're on the 

		    subject, let's just say right 

		    now that Brooks Robinson was 

		    the best third baseman ever.  

		    It's important that you agree 

		    with me on that because I'm 

		    from Baltimore."  Dad, she 

		    thinks Brooks Robinson is the 

		    greatest.



	Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the 

	letter.


	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



				 JONAH

		    Dad!



				 SAM

		    Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson 

		    is the greatest.



				 JONAH

		    It's a sign.



				 SAM

		    Oh, right.



	Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back 

	into the house.



				 SAM

		    Come here.  I want to show you 

		    something.



	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT



	As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is 

	hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah 

	in front of it.



				 SAM

		    Here is Seattle.

			   (moves his finger 

			    across the country)

		    And here is Baltimore.  Case 

		    closed.

			   (he pulls the map and 

			    it snaps back up)



				 JONAH

		    She doesn't want us to go to 

		    Baltimore.  She wants to meet 

		    us in New York City on 

		    Valentine's Day.  On top of the 

		    Empire State Building.



				 SAM

		    Perfect.  We'll be there.



	Sam goes out the door.  Jonah just looks down at his 

	letter, his hopes on hold.  Clarise switches the TV back 

	to Geraldo.



	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT



	Sam sits at a table.  Nursing a beer.  A little nervous.  

	He looks up and spots:



	VICTORIA



	walking into the place.  She's attractive.  She waves 

	and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer 

	from the maitre d'.



	After a beat.



				 SAM

		    Hi.



				 VICTORIA

		    Hi.



	An awkward pause.



				 SAM

		    You look good.



				 VICTORIA

		    You look good yourself.



	Another pause.



				 VICTORIA

		    I thought you were never going 

		    to call me.



				 SAM

		    You did?



				 VICTORIA

		    I really wanted you to call me, 

		    and I thought you were never 

		    going to --



				 SAM

		    You could have called me --



				 VICTORIA

		    No way.  No way I was going to 

		    be the first woman you went out 

		    with after...

			   (she gestures 

			    helplessly)

		    There is no percentage 

		    whatsoever in being the first 

		    woman anyone goes out with 

		    after...



				 SAM

		    You are the first woman I'm 

		    going out with.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh.



				 SAM

		    So whatdya say? I'll get the 

		    check, and I'll call you in 

		    eight months.



	Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.

		    Oh, you are funny --



	We hear a CLICK as the image FREEZES.

	Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.  Annie is

	near the clam bar.

		    Tell me he's living in squalor.  

		    Tell me everything he has is 

		    being repossessed, including 

		    his filthy, dented mobile home.



				 WHEEDLE

		    He's got a houseboat.



				 ANNIE

		    I hate boats.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It sounds nice.



				 ANNIE

		    Boats.  You go out in them.  

		    You come back in them.  I hate 

		    them.



				 WHEEDLE

		    Houseboats don't go anywhere.



				 ANNIE

		    Boats.  All anyone talks about 

		    is the wind.  Is it up, is it 

		    down.  I can't live with a man 

		    who only talks about the wind.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It's not a boat boat.  It's 

		    really a house.



				 ANNIE

		    But it's on the water.



				 WHEEDLE

		    It's on the lake right in the 

		    middle of Seattle.

			      (beat)

		    It rains nine months of the 

		    year in Seattle.



				 ANNIE

		    I hope I don't have to pay for 

		    that piece of information.



				 WHEEDLE

		    No, that's free.  He's an 

		    architect.  Used to do big 

		    high-profile projects.  He 

		    scaled it all back when his 

		    wife died.  Now he remodels 

		    people's homes.  He works in 

		    a small firm, makes a good 

		    living.



	He shows her a good picture of him.



				 ANNIE

		    He's real.



	She goes to the next shot.  Sees a picture of Sam and 

	Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of 

	Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair.



	Hold on Annie's face.



	INT. SEATTLE MARKETPLACE



	With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost 

	identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace.



	Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking 

	around, slightly distracted.



				 JONAH

		    I figure we could go to New 

		    York, catch the Knicks, and 

		    since we'd be there anyway, 

		    obviously we'd go to the Empire 

		    State Building --



				 SAM

		    There she is.



	As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of 

	groceries.



				 JONAH

		    Why is she bringing that bag?



				 SAM

		    She's going to cook something 

		    for us?



				 VICTORIA

		    Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- 

		    you must be Jonah.



				 JONAH

		    Hi.

			   (back to the subject)

		    He should book now because we 

		    can get an excursion fare.  

		    Jessica's parents are travel 

		    agents and --



				 SAM

		    Not now, Jonah.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - LATER



	Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, 

	finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.



				 SAM

		    We can't finish the job.  She's 

		    on her sixth painter, now she's 

		    thinking maybe she wants the 

		    fireplace rebricked --



				 VICTORIA

		    I know her pretty well.  Maybe 

		    I could call her --



				 SAM

		    I've already solved it.  I've 

		    hired a hit man.



	Victoria laughs a little too hard.



				 VICTORIA

		    Oh that is so funny, you are so 

		    funny.



	Sam smiles.  Jonah is appalled.



				 SAM

		    Every time she wants to change 

		    something, she talks in this 

		    little baby voice --

			   (in a little baby 

			    voice)

		    "Couldn't you just move the 

		    stairway a teeny tiny bit?"--



	Victoria almost dies laughing.  Jonah's eyes narrow to 

	slits.



				 JONAH

		    Do you like baseball?



				 VICTORIA

		    Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has 

		    box seats for the Mariners.  

		    Why don't we all go next week?



				 JONAH

		    What about camping?



				 VICTORIA

		    What about it?



				 JONAH

		    Do you like it?



				 VICTORIA

		    I went camping once.

			   (to Sam)

		    I love to brush my teeth in a 

		    brook and floss with a weed.



				 JONAH

		    We ought to start camping 

		    again, Dad.



				 SAM

		    Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.



				 JONAH

		    It's only ten o'clock.



				 SAM

			   (a little edgy)

		    Jonah!



				 JONAH

		    Okay.



				 SAM

		    Thank Victoria for dinner.



				 JONAH

		    Thanks for dinner.  I never saw 

		    anybody cook potatoes that way.



				 SAM

			   (gracious)

		    I'm glad you liked it.  Good 

		    night, Jonah.



	They watch as Jonah pads down the hallway.



	EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - REAR DECK - ON SAM & VICTORIA



	They're standing at the rail, talking.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Jonah has snuck downstairs and is peeking out the window 

	at them.



	Victoria runs her finger down Sam's arm.



	Jonah is horrified.



	He dashes over to the phone and begins to dial.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	A sleeping Annie and Walter are startled awake by the 

	ringing of her phone.



				 ANNIE

			   (groggy)

		    Hello.



				 BECKY

			   (through filter)

		    Turn on your radio!



				 ANNIE

		    What?



				 BECKY

			   (through filter)

		    The kid is on.  You've got me 

		    listening to this garbage.  

		    Go on, turn it on.



				 WALTER

		    Who is it?



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, it's just Becky, she's 

		    having trouble with Rich again.

			   (into phone)

		    Hold on, Becky, I'm going 

		    downstairs.



	She puts the phone on hold and gets out of bed.



	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT



	As Annie comes in and turns on the radio and picks up 

	the phone.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

		    This is a complete disaster.  I 

		    wanted him to find a wife, but 

		    he's got the wrong one --



				 ANNIE

		    How am I going to explain this 

		    to Walter?



				 BECKY (V.O.)

		    Shhh, listen to this --



	Annie takes the portable radio and the telephone 

	receiver, opens the broom closet and closes herself 

	inside.



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Shouldn't your father be the 

		    judge of whether she's right 

		    or wrong?



	ON JONAH



	sneaking glances out at Sam and Victoria as he talks.  

	Victoria puts her arms around Sam's waist and clasps 

	them behind him.



				 JONAH

		    Please, please don't make me 

		    sick.  He's not sane enough to 

		    judge anything.  She's a ho.



	ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BROOM CLOSET, WITH THE TELEPHONE 

	CORD LEADING INTO IT.



				 JONAH (V.O.)

			   (muffled slightly)

		    My dad's been captured by a ho.



	Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window.  Jonah 

	ducks down behind the desk before Sam sees him.



	EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware 

	that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.



				 VICTORIA

		    Is he there?



				 SAM

			   (turning back)

		    No.

			   (beat)

		    After he was born, every time 

		    we started to make love, he 

		    would cry.  He had an uncanny 

		    sense of timing.  We really 

		    shouldn't do anything here 

		    anyway.



				 VICTORIA

		    Absolutely.  Right.



	And she moves in to kiss him.



	ON JONAH



	Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the 

	coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a 

	kiss.



				 JONAH

		    Oh God, it's major.  He's 

		    kissing her on the lips.  I 

		    have to stop this.



	ON BROOM CLOSET



				 ANNIE

			   (muffled)

		    Come on, Jonah --



				 BECKY (V.O.)

		    Do something --



	ON JONAH



				 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

		    Jonah, you can't butt in here.



				 JONAH

		    Yes, I can.



	He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.



							CUT TO:



	ANNIE AS THE BROOM CLOSET DOOR OPENS.



	SHE SCREAMS.



	It's Walter.



				 WALTER

		    Miss Scarlett.  In the broom 

		    closet.  With the radio.



				 ANNIE

			   (to Becky)

		    I gotta go.  I'll see you at 

		    work.

			   (she hangs up, turns 

			    off radio)

		    Walter, you scared me.  Don't 

		    ever do that again.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	As Sam holds Jonah by the shoulders.



				 SAM

		    Don't ever do that again.



				 JONAH

		    I thought I saw a black widow 

		    spider.



	Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs.  Back to Jonah.



				 SAM

		    What are you doing up?



				 JONAH

		    I was thirsty.



				 SAM

		    There's a bathroom upstairs.



				 JONAH

		    The water tastes better in the 

		    kitchen.



				 SAM

		    That's true.  Why is that?



	INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT



	As she and Walter go upstairs to bed.



				 ANNIE

		    Becky heard this woman on the 

		    radio complaining about this 

		    guy she was sure was Rick, 

		    which meant he was cheating on 

		    her.  She was completely 

		    hysterical.  Then it turned out 

		    the woman lived in Duluth.



				 WALTER

		    That doesn't make any sense.



				 ANNIE

		    I know.  It makes no sense at 

		    all.  Thank God my life is in 

		    place.



	INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Walter asleep.  Annie stares up at the ceiling, wide 

	awake.  Thinking.



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Jonah lying on his pillow, staring up at the ceiling, 

	wide awake.  Thinking.



	INT. JESSICA'S PARENTS' TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY



	Jessica is reading the letter from Annie.  She's sitting 

	at a computer in their travel agency, which is on the 

	entrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse.  Jonah 

	sitting there.



				 JESSICA

		    Write her.



				 JONAH

		    You think so?



				 JESSICA

		    It's Y. O. H.



				 JONAH

			   (agreeing)

		    Yeah.

			   (a beat)

		    What's that?



				 JESSICA

		    Your only hope.



	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY



	Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky.



				 ANNIE

		    I thought I would look into 

		    doing a story about those radio 

		    shows.



				 BECKY

			   (nods; after a beat)

		    You'd probably have to go 

		    somewhere to really look into 

		    it.



				 ANNIE

		    Definitely.



	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER



	Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.  As Jonah opens the 

	mailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a SQUEAL OF 

	BRAKES.  It's Sam's car.



				 SAM

			   (angry)

		    Get in the car right this 

		    minute.



	Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica.



				 JESSICA

		    I'll call you later.



	Jonah gets in.



	INT. SAM'S CAR - CONTINUOUS



				 SAM

		    Did you call that radio station 

		    again?



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    Everyone at work heard you.



				 JONAH

		    I just called for a second.



				 SAM

		    Long enough to call Victoria a 

		    ho.



				 JONAH

		    It's a short word.



				 SAM

		    This is not a joke.  Thank God 

		    Victoria doesn't know.  It 

		    would really have hurt her 

		    feelings.



				 JONAH

			   (really getting into 

			    it)

		    If she knew, she'd never 

		    forgive me.  It would be 

		    hopeless for the two of you.



	EXT. SEATTLE STREET - CONTINUOUS

	And pull back to reveal:



	EXT. BALTIMORE RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie and Walter get out of the car, dressed for a 

	dinner.



				 WALTER

		    Couldn't you just do a phone 

		    interview?



				 ANNIE

		    Not for the kind of place I 

		    want to do.  I won't be in 

		    Chicago that long.



				 WALTER

		    When you get back, I'll be 

		    gone --



				 ANNIE

		    And then I'll see you in New 

		    York --



				 WALTER

		    Okay, okay.



	EXT. BALTIMORE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY



	A 747 accelerates down the runway and blasts into the 

	winter sky.



	INT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - DAY



	Annie is looking out the window, preoccupied.



				 PILOT'S VOICE

		    This is Captain Foster 

		    welcoming you aboard Flight 132 

		    to Seattle.  Our flying time 

		    today...



				 ANNIE

		    Do you believe that any lie is 

		    a betrayal? That's what Harold 

		    Pinter says, but it seems to me 

		    it's a very harsh way of 

		    drawing the line.



	Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate, 

	who in any case doesn't speak English, completely 

	mystified.



	INT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate, 

	watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound 

	for Minneapolis.



				 VICTORIA

			   (turning to Jonah)

		    Can I bring something back for 

		    you? A souvenir?

			   (to Sam)

		    Does he like those little snow 

		    scenes?

			   (to Jonah)

		    You know -- you shake them up 

		    and the snow floats down?



	Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly.  Be nice or else.



				 JONAH

			   (extremely polite)

		    Sure.  I'd really like that.  

		    Thank you so much.



				 VICTORIA

		    Well...



				 JONAH

		    I think they're announcing your 

		    flight.



	Sure enough, passengers are starting to board.



				 SAM

		    He's ten.



				 VICTORIA

			      (he's good at it)

		    He's good at it.



				 SAM

		    I read an article about this

		    ...



				 VICTORIA

		    I read the same article...



				 SAM

		    It takes time --



				 VICTORIA

		    Absolutely.  When I come back, 

		    maybe the two of us should 

		    spend some time together, on 

		    our own.  What do you think?



				 SAM

		    Sure.  Sure.



	Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.  

	As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his 

	finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.



				 SAM

			   (impatiently)

		    Jonah, this isn't fair.  You 

		    don't know Victoria.  I hardly 

		    know her myself.  She is, in 

		    fact, a mystery to me.  She 

		    tosses her hair a lot.  Why 

		    does she do this? I have no 

		    idea.  Is it a twitch? Does 

		    she need a haircut? Should she 

		    use barrette so it doesn't 

		    keep falling in her face? 

		    These are things that I'm 

		    willing to get to the bottom 

		    of, and that is why I am dating 

		    her.  That is all I am doing.  

		    I am not marrying her.  Can you 

		    appreciate the difference? 

		    That's what single people do, 

		    they try people on and they see 

		    if they fit.  But nobody fits 

		    perfectly, everyone is an 

		    adjustment.



				 JONAH

		    Was Mom an adjustment?



				 SAM

			   (complete exasperation)

		    I'm never going to meet anyone 

		    who's going to measure up to 

		    your mom in your eyes? What do 

		    you think? There's a perfect 

		    woman walking around out there?



	At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next 

	to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us.



				 SAM

		    There's no such thing as a 

		    perf --



	Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by 

	her looks, her fluidity, her poise.



	Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches 

	from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.  

	Sam continues to stare at her.



				 SAM

			   (to himself, referring 

			    to Annie)

		    God, she's beautiful.



				 JONAH

			   (unaware he's talking 

			    about Annie)

		    Victoria? She's okay.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to 

	lose sight of Annie.



				 JONAH

		    Dad, I was talking to Jessica 

		    about reincarnation, and she 

		    thinks that probably you knew 

		    Annie in another life.



				 SAM

			   (completely distracted)

		    Who is Annie?



				 JONAH

		    The one who wrote us.



	Sam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he 

	doesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because 

	he has to wait for Jonah.



				 JONAH

			   (continuing)

		    But Jessica says you and Annie 

		    never got together in that 

		    life, and your hearts are like 

		    puzzles with parts out of them 

		    and when you get together the 

		    puzzle's complete.



	He's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight.



				 SAM

		    God dammit.



	A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows.  

	As they walk into the distance --



				 JONAH

		    The reason I know this and you 

		    don't is that I'm younger and 

		    purer so I'm more in touch with 

		    cosmic forces.



				 SAM

		    I sincerely hope you are not 

		    going to marry Jessica.



	EXT. AIRPORT CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY



	As the shuttle bus drops Annie off at a rental car.  As 

	she gets in and starts the car.



	EXT/INT. SEATTLE/RENTAL CAR - DAY



	Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring 

	continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger 

	seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat.



	EXT. STREET FRONTING THE BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT SLIP -- DAY



	Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the 

	Baldwins' marina.  She stops, blocking the driveway to 

	the marina.



	ON ANNIE IN HER RENTAL CAR



	checking the map.



	Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.  She looks 

	into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in 

	their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into 

	their driveway.



	Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and 

	speeds away, tires squealing.



	EXT. SEATTLE GAS STATION - DAY



	Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room.



	INT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY



	Annie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her 

	face.  She towels it off and looks into the mirror.

	She settles on the matter-of-fact reading.

	watching.  She's at a safe distance, across the street 

	and down some from the marina entrance.  She watches it 

	for a moment, then gains courage.  She starts to cross 

	the street to enter the dock.



	EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS



	Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat.  Nervously.  Goes up 

	to the door.  Adjusts herself quickly and knocks.  No 

	response.  Let down, she's just about to walk away when 

	she hears a motor REV UP.



	Annie peeks around the side of Sam's houseboat and spots 

	Sam and Jonah heading out in their dingy.

	EXT. ALKI BEACH - ON SAM AND JONAH



	They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken 

	clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water.  

	They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of 

	skips, arguing over the merits of each throw.



	ON ANNIE



	checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak.



							DISSOLVE TO:



	ANNIE'S POV - ON SAM AND JONAH - LATER



	They're throwing a football.  Jonah catches it and 

	starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and 

	feinting.  Sam tackles him and they tumble together on 

	the beach.



	CLOSE ON ANNIE



	watching.  The purity and innocence of this little scene 

	-- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more 

	than she ever could have imagined.  Their LAUGHTER 

	filters up to her.  Right to her heart.



				 ANNIE (V.O.)

	Annie hangs up the phone.  She turns off the light.  

	Moonlight coming through the window.  Hold on her.



	EXT. STREET NEAR MARINA - DAY



	Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out.



	Sam's van pulls into a parking space.  Jonah in the 

	front with Sam.  They're diagonally across a four-lane 

	street.



	ON SAM AND JONAH



	As they start to get groceries out of the car.



	Annie watching.  This is it.  No chickening out this time.



	She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole 

	thing.  It's now or never.



	Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.



	Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and 

	rightness with every step.



	But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:



	SUZY



	who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at 

	the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide -- 

	beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose 

	boys have just come back from the front.  Sam and Jonah 

	are overjoyed to see her.  Jonah breaks into a run, 

	nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings 

	up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped 

	when he started running.



	ON ANNIE



	She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.  

	In shock.  The scene in front of her is too horrible to 

	bear.



	ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA



	Sam catches up.  Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious 

	than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam 

	and hugs them both.



	ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY.



				 SAM

		    God, it's wonderful to see you.  

		    Where's Greg?



				 SUZY

		    He's over at the boat show.  

		    He'll be by later.

			   (she looks around)

		    It's so beautiful here.



	ANNIE



	There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about 

	this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the 

	middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all 

	she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.  

	She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --



	A TAXICAB



	coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.  

	Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van 

	bearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps 

	back to the middle line.



	The cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes.



	Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.  

	The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.



	Annie screams.



	The cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the 

	other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.



	ON SAM



	responding.  He runs from the gate toward the near-

	accident.



	ON THE CAB DRIVER



	getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the 

	sidewalk.



				 DRIVER

		    Lady, what the hell are you 

		    doing?



	Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, 

	hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she 

	turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their 

	eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw 

	in the airport.



				 SAM

		    Hello.



				 ANNIE

		    Hello.



	Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything 

	that's happened, bolts for her car.



	Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is 

	coming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets 

	into her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there, 

	deflated.

	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



	Becky and Annie looking at the television.



				 BECKY

		    It's a sign --



				 ANNIE

		    It's a sign I've watched this 

		    movie too many times.

			   (beat)

		    I'm so stupid.  From the minute 

		    I listen to that stupid program 

		    on the radio, I've been a 

		    complete jerk.



	She starts absently going through the mail, throwing 

	almost all of it away without even opening it.



				 BECKY

		    You don't know who she was, 

		    Annie --



				 ANNIE

		    I saw her.  She looked just 

		    like this --



	She shows Becky the photo of Victoria and Sam having 

	dinner.



				 BECKY

		    This is a photo of hair.



				 ANNIE

		    Well, it's the same woman.  And 

		    he was crazy about her.

			   (looking at one letter)

		    What is this?

			   (beat)

		    This is from Seattle.



	She opens the letter.



	Reads it.



	Looks up at Becky.



				 ANNIE

		    Becky?



				 BECKY

		    So I mailed your letter.



				 ANNIE

			   (reading the letter)

		    "Dear Annie: Thanks for your 

		    letter.  It was great.  We're 

		    very excited about meeting you 

		    in New York on Valentine's Day 

		    and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. 

		    Sleepless in Seattle."



				 BECKY

		    M.F.E.O.?



				 ANNIE

		    Made for each other.



	A long beat.



				 BECKY

		    It's cute.  It's like a little 

		    clue.



	Annie looks at her balefully.



				 BECKY

			   (continuing)

		    So he can't write.  Big deal.  

		    I mean, verbal ability is a 

		    highly overrated thing in a 

		    guy, and our pathetic need for 

		    it is what gets us into so much 

		    trouble.



				 ANNIE

			   (with resolve)

		    I'm going to run back to 

		    Walter's arms, if he's still 

		    have me.



				 BECKY

		    What about the letter?



				 ANNIE

		    It doesn't mean anything.  It 

		    was written before I went out 

		    there.  Before the ho.



	She puts the letter on an ashtray, takes a match and 

	lights it.  They both watch it burn.



	CLOSEUP ON THE FIRE



	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



	A fire is blazing in the wood-burning stove.  Suzy is 

	sitting with her husband Greg and Sam.  Jonah is in 

	evidence, curled up on the couch under some blankets, 

	asleep.  On the table near the couch is red construction 

	paper for valentines, doilies, magic markers, etc.



				 SUZY

		    You saw her in the airport and 

		    then here?



				 SAM

		    I tried to talk to her...

			   (he shrugs)

		    It was like I knew her.  Weird.



				 GREG

		    Well, at least you're out there 

		    seeing people again.  That's 

		    terrific.



				 SAM

		    Well, just one really.



				 SUZY

		    How's Jonah taking it?



				 SAM

		    It'll take him a while to come 

		    around.  A month ago he called 

		    one of those radio call-in 

		    shows and told them I needed a 

		    wife --



				 SUZY

			   (charmed)

		    You're kidding --



				 SAM

		    Now that I'm seeing someone, 

		    it's a whole other thing.



	ON JONAH



	he's not asleep after all.  He's been listening all 

	along.



				 SAM

		    He's become obsessed with 

		    some woman who wrote me --



				 GREG

		    Are you serious?



				 SAM

		    She wants to meet me at the top 

		    of the Empire State Building.



				 SUZY

		    It's a little derivative.



				 SAM

		    What do you mean?



				 SUZY

		    "An Affair To Remember." Did 

		    you ever see it? Cary Grant 

		    and Deborah Kerr.  Before that 

		    it was called "Love Affair With 

		    Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."



				 GREG

		    Women love this movie.



	On Jonah, listening.



				 SUZY

		    They met at the Empire State 

		    Building, only they didn't.  

		    Never mind.



				 GREG

		    What kind of person would write 

		    to someone they heard on the 

		    radio?



				 SAM

		    I got hundreds of letters from 

		    women all over the country --



				 GREG

		    Desperate women --



				 SUZY

		    Just because someone's looking 

		    for a nice guy doesn't make 

		    them desperate.



				 GREG

		    How about rapacious and love-

		    starved?



				 SUZY

		    No.



				 GREG

		    It is easier to be killed by a 

		    terrorist --



				 SUZY

		    It is not --



				 GREG

		    Right, right.



	Suzy's irritated.



				 SAM

		    Anyway, Victoria's nice.



				 SUZY

		    Would you follow her through an 

		    airport?



				 SAM

		    Look, I met somebody.  She's 

		    good, and capable and smart.  

		    We hit it off.  We can't spend 

		    your life chasing after 

		    fantasies.



	Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is 

	serious about Victoria.



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - ON SAM IN BED - NIGHT



	The door to his bedroom opens.



	Annie walks in.  She's wearing a white men's shirt.



				 ANNIE

		    Hi.



				 SAM

		    Hi.

			   (a beat)

		    So far so good.  So.  What 

		    should we talk about? How 

		    insecure we were in high 

		    school.  Shirley Votypka, the 

		    first girl I ever felt up.  

		    Health.  What about health? 

		    Did you know that eating six 

		    macadamia nuts is the 

		    equivalent of eating a steak?



				 ANNIE

		    Shhhh --



	She unbuttons her shirt.



	And they kiss.



	FREEZE FRAME on the kiss.  It becomes the silhouette of 

	a man and a woman kissing.



	AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

	

	The silhouette of a man and a woman kissing on a red box

	of Valentine's Day chocolates and now we see:



	EXT. BALTIMORE - VALENTINE'S DAY - DAY



	A few quick shot of Valentine's Day in Baltimore: shop 

	windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts, 

	lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral 

	arrangements, old ladies selling chocolates, young 

	ladies selling perfume.



	A red Valentine's envelope is being tossed on a desk, 

	and pull back to reveal:



	INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY



	Annie at work.  She looks at the card and opens it.  

	It's from Walter.  She smiles.  Looks up.  There's 

	Becky.



				 BECKY

		    You're going to miss the train.



				 ANNIE

		    No, I'm not.

			   (she starts assembling 

			    her things)



				 BECKY

		    What are your plans in New 

		    York?



				 ANNIE

		    We're going to the Rainbow Room 

		    and the symphony tomorrow night.



				 BECKY

		    I love the symphony.



				 ANNIE

			   (cheerfully)

		    I hate it.

			   (she stands to go, 

			    starts toward the 

			    elevator)

		    I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I 

		    feel happy.  This is right.  

		    This is real.  Everything else 

		    is what happens when you watch 

		    too many movies and completely 

		    lose sight of what counts.

			   (as she steps into 

			    elevator)

		    Please don't tell anyone about 

		    what happened.  "Sleepless in 

		    Seattle" is history.



	INT. BALTIMORE TRAIN STATION - DAY



	Annie through the train window as the train starts to 

	move out of the station.



	MAP OF THE UNITED STATES.



	The map we saw at the beginning of the movie, as the 

	light dims in Baltimore and a light goes on in New York.



	EXT. NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT



	Annie steps out of a cab.



	INT. NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT



	Walter opens the door to a beautiful suite.  A bouquet 

	of flowers sits on the desk.  A bucket of champagne.



	Annie throws herself into his arms.



	Walter sneezes.



	EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DAY



	And pull back to reveal that it's a shot from "An Affair 

	To Remember."



	And pull back to reveal:



	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - DAY



	JONAH is watching with his little girlfriend JESSICA, 

	who's crying.



				 JESSICA

			   (weeping)

		    This is the best movie I've 

		    ever seen in my life.



				 JONAH

		    I don't get it.



				 JESSICA

		    You have to go to her, Jonah.  

		    You have to find her.



	Jonah nods.  But he isn't sure how he's going to do it.



				 JONAH

		    Do you know how much it costs 

		    to go to New York?



				 JESSICA

		    Nobody knows.  It changes 

		    practically every day.  How 

		    much money do you have?



				 JONAH

		    Eighty dollars.



				 JESSICA

		    I have forty-two.  So that 

		    would definitely cover 

		    taxicabs, I think.



				 JONAH

		    But how am I going to get 

		    there?



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Honey, I'm going out for a few 

		    minutes.

			   (sticking her head in 

			    the door to the living 

			    room)

		    Could you keep an eye on things 

		    out front till I get back?



	Jessica looks over at Jonah.



				 JESSICA

		    Sure.



	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - TRAVEL AGENCY OFFICE - DAY



	Jessica is working on the computer.  She punches Jonah's 

	name into it.



				 JESSICA

		    Do you want an aisle or a 

		    window seat?



				 JONAH

		    Window.



				 JESSICA

		    Do you want a fruit plate?



				 JONAH

		    I don't know.  Do I?



				 JESSICA

			   (shrugs)

		    I'd rather die than eat on an 

		    airplane.

			   (beat)

		    I'm telling them you're twelve 

		    so you can fly unaccompanied 

		    and they won't make you be 

		    carried around by a stewardess 

		    and everything.



	Jonah nods.



	Now Jessica takes a ticket form out of the desk and 

	starts to fill it out for Jonah.



	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - TIFFANY'S - A SCULPTED GLASS HEART 

	- DAY



	formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in 

	pink light and spotlighted in white.



	Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples 

	mostly -- looking in the windows.  Each one a variation 

	on the heart motif.  They move to a window -- "Broken 

	Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out 

	of the wound in the middle.



	ON WALTER AND ANNIE'S REFLECTION



	in the Broken Heart window.



	They're both in their own worlds.  Then they both start 

	to speak at once.  They stop.  Annie looks at Walter.



				 ANNIE

		    You go.



				 WALTER

		    Ever since Christmas, you've 

		    been different.  Kind of 

		    distracted, distant.  But I 

		    feel like you're coming back 

		    from wherever you were.



				 ANNIE

		    I am.

			   (she smiles at him)

		    I was just... I just got... I 

		    think I got nervous.  It's 

		    normal, right? Don't you ever 

		    feel nervous about, you know?



				 WALTER

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    About forever.



				 WALTER

		    No.



				 ANNIE

		    Well, I did.  And you know what 

		    I think? I think that it was 

		    almost... too perfect.



	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



	As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department 

	to the elevator.



				 ANNIE

		    I started to wonder whether we 

		    were the human equivalent of 

		    two rights making a wrong, you 

		    know?



	Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely 

	good-natured about it.



	INT. THIRD FLOOR TIFFANY'S - DAY



	Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed 

	by a SALESWOMAN who is carrying a large white card on 

	which she is noting their selections.



				 ANNIE

		    It was like kismet but not, if 

		    you see what I mean.



	Walter's brow furrows slightly.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    You have to grow up.  You can't 

		    have all these adolescent 

		    dreams about how exciting your 

		    life is going to be --



	Walter starting to look puzzled.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    Don't hate me but I love this 

		    pattern.



			    	 WALTER

		    You couldn't.



				 ANNIE

		    I do.



				 WALTER

		    It's just like my grandmother's 

		    china.



				 SALESWOMAN

		    How many place settings should 

		    I put down?



				 ANNIE & WALTER

		    Ten.



	Walter beams at her.



				 WALTER

		    Exactly.  Eight is too few and 

		    twelve is too many.



	The SALESWOMAN writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper.



	INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



	As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the 

	ground floor and WALTER stops for a moment at the 

	Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue 

	Tiffany's box he gives to Annie.



	Annie opens it.



	Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring.



				 ANNIE

		    Walter.



				 WALTER

		    It was my mother's.



				 ANNIE

		    It's so beautiful.  It's just 

		    what I would have picked out if 

		    I'd had every ring in the world 

		    to choose from.

			   (as she slips the ring 

			    onto her finger)

		    You see what I mean.  There are 

		    people who would like a 

		    relationship to be full of 

		    surprises, but I am not one of 

		    them.

			   (as she starts out the 

			    door with Walter 

			    behind, thinking about 

			    what she has just 

			    said)

		    Surprises are highly overrated.



	As they go out the door to:



	EXT. FIFTH AVE.  - DAY



	As they start down the street and go off into the 

	distance.



				 ANNIE

			   (continuing)

		    Promise me something, Walter.  

		    Promise me you will never have 

		    a surprise party for me.  Ever.  

		    You know what happens, you walk 

		    in the door in some horrible 

		    sweater you put on that morning, 

		    and there are hundreds of people 

		    in their best clothes shouting 

		    "Surprise!"



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



	Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing.  Jonah is 

	standing in the doorway, watching.



	He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find 

	it.  He tries a few drawers.



				 SAM

		    Have you seen my wallet?



				 JONAH

		    It might be in the kitchen.



	Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen.



				 SAM

		    I'm only going to be away one 

		    night, okay, and Clarise will 

		    be here.  You'll have a swell 

		    time.  You'll watch a little 

		    Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm 

		    Street 12, I'll never know.



				 JONAH

		    Are you going with her?



				 SAM

		    Yes.



	Jonah walks out of Sam's bedroom and we hear the door to 

	his bedroom slam shut.



	ON SAM



	Starting to boil.



	He walks into --



	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT



	And open the door to Jonah's room.



	INT. JONAH'S ROOM - NIGHT



				 SAM

		    I have to have a life.  I have 

		    to do things that I want with 

		    people my own age.  It's none 

		    of your business who I am going 

		    out with.  I don't give a good 

		    goddam if you're angry --



				 JONAH

			   (holding up Annie's 

			    letter)

		    This is the one I like.



	Sam starts back to his bedroom.



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



				 SAM

		    I don't care who you like.  

		    It's who I like.  But the truth 

		    is you're never going to like 

		    anyone because it isn't your 

		    mother.



	Sam throws a pair of socks into the suitcase.



				 JONAH

			   (yelling)

		    Fine.  I won't say anything.  

		    You can marry Count Dracula.



				 SAM

		    Thank you, Jonah.  But the 

		    point is, I am not asking 

		    permission.



				 JONAH

			   (yelling)

		    What's wrong with Annie?



				 SAM

			   (emphasizing every 

			    word)

		    Shut up.



	Jonah appears at the doorway.



				 JONAH

		    Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never 

		    did that.  Mom never said shut 

		    up to me.  Mom never yelled at 

		    me.



				 SAM

		    This conversation is finished.



				 JONAH

		    You said we could go to New 

		    York.



				 SAM

		    Did not.



				 JONAH

		    Did too.



				 SAM

		    I can't know what I said, but 

		    we're not going.



				 JONAH

			   (crossing his arms 

			    across his chest)

		    I'm not leaving this room until 

		    you say yes.



				 SAM

		    Get out.



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    Goddammit, I am sick of this 

		    --



	Sam picks Jonah up and carries him kicking and screaming 

	into:



	INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT



	and into:



	INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



				 JONAH

		    Put me down.  I hate you, I 

		    hate you --



	He throws Jonah on the bed.  Jonah in tears.



				 SAM

		    I'm sick of this phony 

		    melodramatic bullshit.  I'm 

		    sick of it.



	He leaves the room and slams the door.



	INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS



	Jonah weeping as Sam goes back to his bedroom.



	INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



	The sound of Jonah weeping.



	Sam sits down on the bed, wiped out.  Hold on him.



	EXT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - MORNING



	As Clarise the babysitter arrives at the houseboat.



	INT. HOUSEBOAT - MORNING



	Sam and Clarise in the hallway outside Jonah's door.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?  Clarise is here, okay? 

		    And I'm leaving.



	No response.



				 SAM

		    Jonah?

			   (to Clarise)

		    He's probably still asleep.



	He opens the door gently to the room.



	Jonah's gone.



	IN QUICK CUTS:



	Sam looks in the bathroom: no Jonah.  In the main cabin.  

	The back deck.  Out onto the docks.  Looking all up and 

	down.  Clarise coming down the deck -- she's apparently 

	been looking in the neighborhood.  As she shakes her 

	head no, Sam goes to the bicycle shed.  Jonah's bike 

	still there.  Sam stands on the deck.



	EXT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	We see a group of people filing off an airport shuttle 

	bus.  The sign in front rotates from "Airport" back to 

	"Marina."



	Jonah comes down the stairs and steps off with his 

	Mariners backpack.  He just stands there a beat, looking 

	around.  Then he goes through the glass doors.



	INT. AIRPORT FIRST CLASS TICKET COUNTER - DAY



	The TICKET CLERK turns back to the counter.



				 TICKET CLERK

		    Next.



	Jonah steps forward, with his ticket.



	INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - DAY



	Jessica is sitting defiantly in a chair in the middle of 

	the living room.  She is being interrogated but she is 

	not going to talk.  There's a clock on the mantel.  Sam 

	is in the room with Jessica's mother and father.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Jessica, this is not 

		    acceptable.



				 JESSICA'S FATHER

		    If you don't tell us right now, 

		    right this minute, I'm going to 

		    kill you.



	Jessica rolls her eyes.



	She looks over the clock on the mantel.  As it ticks 

	to 8:30:



				 JESSICA

		    He's on his way to New York.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    What?



				 SAM

		    How?



				 JESSICA

			   (the child of travel 

			    agents)

		    United 597.



	Jessica's mother and father are horrified.



				 JESSICA'S MOTHER

		    Jessica!



				 SAM

		    When does it leave?



				 JESSICA'S FATHER

		    Eight-thirty.



	Everyone looks over at the clock.  It says 8:31.  

	Jessica smiles.



	INT. SAM'S CAR - DAY



	CLOSE ON SAM



	Driving to the airport.



	EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



	As his car takes the airport exit.



	INT. AIRPLANE - DAY



	A stewardess bends affectionately over Jonah, ensconced 

	in the first-class section.  He's got his backpack on 

	his lap and he's holding it.



				 STEWARDESS

		    Here you go... here's a nice pin 

		    for you, for flying with us.



				 JONAH

			   (completely unmoved, 

			    but polite)

		    Thank you.



				 STEWARDESS

		    You're welcome.  Can I take 

		    that for you?



				 JONAH

			   (clutching it even 

			    tighter)

		    No.



	INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER - ON SAM - DAY



	at the reservations desk.  Desperation.



				 SAM

			   (frantic)

		    He's about this high, 90 

		    pounds, never combs his hair, 

		    Mariner's hat --



				 AIRLINE CLERK

			   (to his colleagues)

		    Anyone check in a 

		    unaccompanied minor on the New 

		    York flight?



				 FIRST CLASS TICKET CLERK

		    I did.



	Sam closes his eyes.



				 SAM

		    I'll kill him.

			   (beat)

		    I have to get to New York as 

		    fast as I can.



				 AIRLINE CLERK

		    We can get you on a flight to 

		    Chicago and you can change 

		    planes --



	Starting to punch information into the computer.



				 AIRLINE CLERK

		    How will you be paying for 

		    this?



				 SAM

			   (taking out his wallet)

		    American Express.

			   (there's no American 

			    Express card in his 

			    wallet)

		    Visa.

			   (beat)

		    I really am going to kill him.



	INT. O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY



	As Sam comes out of the plane from Seattle and dashes 

	through the concourse, managing to arrive at the plane 

	for New York at the very last moment.



	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY



	As Jonah comes out of the plane from Seattle and looks 

	up to see which way to go.  He looks very small.  Big 

	New York passengers in a hurry whiz by with their 

	carryons dangerously flying at their sides.



	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - A FEW MINUTES LATER



	Jonah stands in a taxi line.



	INT. TAXI - A FEW MINUTES LATER



	Jonah sits down in the back seat.  Looks up.  A big 

	bruiser of a CAB DRIVER leans back over the seat, sizing 

	Jonah up.



				 TAXI DRIVER

		    Where to?



				 JONAH

		    Empire State Building.



	INT. PLANE TO NEW YORK - DAY



	Sam is in an aisle seat.  He closes his eyes and 

	squeezes them tight.



				 SAM

			   (to himself)

		    Come on... come on... come on... 

		    COMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEON...



	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - AFTERNOON



	It looks magnificent in the waning afternoon light.



				 CABBIE'S VOICE

		    There it is.



	We are watching from:



	INT. A TAXICAB



	where Jonah, with his head out the window, regards the 

	building with awe.



				 CABBIE

		    What are you gonna do there, 

		    spit off the top?



				 JONAH

		    No.  I'm gonna meet...

			   (trying to figure out 

			    what to call her)

		    my mother.



	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



	Walter and Annie walking toward their table with the 

	MAITRE D'.



	Annie sits down, looks at the view.  Walter starts to 

	sit, revealing a spectacular view of the EMPIRE STATE 

	BUILDING directly behind him.  Annie's smile fades.



				 WALTER

		    Is something wrong.



	Annie shakes her head.



				 MAITRE D'

		    May I get you a drink?



				 WALTER

		    Some champagne?



				 ANNIE

		    Fine, fine.



	Walter glances back over his shoulder.



				 WALTER

		    Beautiful view, isn't it?



				 ANNIE

		    Walter, there's something I 

		    have to tell you --



	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DUSK



	As Sam rushes out of the terminal.  Desperate.



	A cab pulls up.  Sam bolts to the head of the line and 

	muscles his way into the cab.  The other people in line 

	are irate.



				 SAM

		    Sorry, this is an emergency.



	The cab pulls out to a chorus of verbal abuse.



				 SAM (V.O.)

		    Empire State Building.



	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING LOBBY - DUSK



	Jonah, carrying his backpack, walks through the majestic 

	lobby and follows the arrow to the Observation Deck.



	EXT. TOP OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - HELICOPTER SHOT - DESK



	Looking down on the observation deck.  The city below.  

	The tiny figure of Jonah walks into the middle of the 

	deck.  Looks around.



	EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DUSK



	Sam's cab speeds across the bridge and into Manhattan, 

	heading for the Empire State Building.



	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DUSK



	Jonah is going to take the bull by the horns.  He walks 

	up to a likely-looking WOMAN.



				 JONAH

		    Hi, I'm Jonah.  Are you Annie?



				 WOMAN #1

		    No.

			   (smiles at him)

		    I'm Cynthia.



	He spies another unattached woman.



				 JONAH

		    Excuse me, are you Annie?



	EXT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



	A helicopter shot of Annie talking animatedly to Walter.



	And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is 

	actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in:



	EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - DUSK INTO 

	NIGHT



	Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.  He turns 

	around, forlorn.  He takes off his backpack and is about 

	to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the 

	observation deck.



	Jonah leaps into his arms.



				 SAM

		    You're my family.  You're all 

		    I've got.  What if something 

		    happened to you?



	Sam's eyes well up.  Jonah starts to cry.



				 SAM

		    What if I couldn't get to you?



				 JONAH

		    I was scared of what you were 

		    gonna do.



				 SAM

		    When I found you?



				 JONAH

		    If I didn't go.



				 SAM

		    Listen, have I ever done 

		    anything really stupid?



				 JONAH

		    No.



				 SAM

		    I mean, so far, have I screwed 

		    it up for you?



				 JONAH

		    No.



	The two of them hold each other tight.  After a beat:



				 SAM

		    I can't believe you flew first 

		    class.



				 JONAH

		    It was all they had.



	INT. RAINBOW ROOM - NIGHT



	Annie and Walter.  There's champagne in their glasses, 

	but neither of them has drunk a drop.



				 ANNIE

		    I don't know what to say about 

		    it, Walter.  It was a form of 

		    temporary insanity.  But I had 

		    to tell you about it because --



				 WALTER

			   (matter-of-fact)

		    -- it was a betrayal.



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It 

		    was just...



				 WALTER

		    So what happened?



				 ANNIE

		    I told you.  Nothing --



				 WALTER

		    At the top of the Empire State 

		    Building --



				 ANNIE

		    I'm not at the top of the 

		    Empire State Building.  I'm 

		    here.



				 WALTER

		    Not really.

			   (beat)

		    Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's 

		    leave that out of it.  I don't 

		    want to be someone you're 

		    settling for.  I don't want to 

		    be someone anyone settles for.

			      (beat)

		    I have a life insurance policy,  

		    I'm fully invested in growth 

		    stocks, I have a paid 

		    subscription to Home Rox 

		    Office, I have no sexual 

		    diseases, I have been steadily 

		    employed in a part of the 

		    economy that isn't soft, I have 

		    expectation in the way of 

		    inherited wealth, I dress 

		    nicely, I am a member of the 

		    private sector, an independent 

		    voter, I don't watch Monday 

		    Night Football, the only thing 

		    wrong with me is that I am 

		    allergic to wheat, 

		    strawberries, penicillin, 

		    pollen, nuts and wool.  There 

		    are plenty of women who see me 

		    as the brass ring.  If you 

		    don't -- marriage is hard 

		    enough without bringing such 

		    low expectations into it, isn't 

		    it?



	Annie is nodding.  She wipes a tear from her face.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve 

		    you.



				 WALTER

		    I think that's what I'm saying.



	Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off 

	her finger and hands it to Walter.



	No bitterness here.  Both of them trying to be gentle 

	with each other.



				 ANNIE

		    You okay?



				 WALTER

		    Yes.

			   (beat)

		    Some people will do anything to 

		    get out of going to a symphony.



	This breaks the tension.  Both of them smiles.



				 ANNIE

		    Oh!



				 WALTER

		    What?



				 ANNIE

		    Look!



	Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie 

	sees:



	THE LIGHTS HAVE JUST GONE ON ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 

	VALENTINE LIGHTS:



	A huge pink and white heart.



	Walter turns back to Annie.



				 WALTER

		    Go for it.



	And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.



							CUT TO:



	EXT. WEST 50TH STREET - NIGHT



	As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.



	As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.



	INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT



	The lights are on all over the city.



	The crowd has thinned out considerably.  Jonah and Sam 

	are among the last people left.  They gaze out at the 

	twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.



				 ELEVATOR OPERATOR

		    Last call.  Closing time.



	Jonah looks at Sam.



				 JONAH

		    This is pretty dumb, wasn't 

		    it?



	Sam shrugs.



				 SAM

		    Big deal.



	After a beat.



				 SAM

		    Maybe we'll get a dog when we 

		    get back.



				 JONAH

		    Okay.



				 SAM

		    What do you mean, okay? 

		    Wouldn't you like a dog?



				 JONAH

		    Sure.



	Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the 

	elevator.



				 SAM

		    Let's go home.



	EXT. FIFTH AVE - NIGHT



	Annie's cab stuck in traffic.



	As Annie gets out of the cab.



	She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State 

	Building.



	INT. LOBBY OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



	Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators 

		    are closed.



				 ANNIE

			   (out of breath)

		    No.  Please.  I really need to 

		    get up there.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    We're closing up.  No more runs 

		    tonight.



	Annie takes a deep breath.  She's hit the end of the 

	road.  She turns to go but then turns back.



				 ANNIE

			   (out of breath)

		    Listen, can I just take a look? 

		    Maybe... maybe... There's 

		    someone I was supposed to 

		    meet... He's probably not 

		    there, but if I don't at least 

		    look I'll always wonder about 

		    it.



	The Information Booth Person looks at her.



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    Cary Grant, right?



				 ANNIE

		    You know that movie?



				 INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

		    One of my wife's favorites.



	INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING



	After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very 

	empty platform.



				 ELEVATOR MAN

		    Sorry, ma'am.  Empty.



	Annie slowly walks out.



				 ANNIE

		    Can I take a minute?



				 ELEVATOR MAN

		    Go ahead.



	She sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the 

	twinkling lights below.



	She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees 

	something on the floor.



	Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.



	She picks it up.  She realizes that it might be... 

	could be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and 

	Jonah's teddy bear.  As she takes out the bear the other 

	elevator DINGS.



	Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.



				 JONAH

		    I left it near the...



	And they stop.  There she is.  There they are.  Sam 

	can't believe it.  It's the mystery woman.



				 SAM

		    It's you.



				 ANNIE

		    It's me?



				 SAM

		    The one in the street.  I 

		    chased after you.



				 JONAH

		    Are you Annie?



				 ANNIE

		    Yes.



				 SAM

			   (confused)

	    You're Annie too?



	She smiles awkwardly.



				 ANNIE

			   (indicating the 

			    backpack)

		    Is this yours?



	Jonah walks over to her.  He puts his hand out.  She 

	shakes it solemnly.



				 JONAH

		    I'm Jonah.

			   (nodding back to Sam)

		    That's my dad.  His name is 

		    Sam.



				 ANNIE

		    Hi, Jonah.  Sam.

			   (indicating the teddy 

			    bear)

		    And who is this?



				 JONAH

		    Howard.



				 ANNIE

		    Howard.



	Sam nods.  Smiling.  Starting to put it all together.  

	Annie smiles.  Still nervous.  No one knows what to do 

	next.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS 

	HIS THROAT.



				 SAM

		    We better go.



	Annie nods.



	Sam holds out his hand.



				 SAM

		    Shall we?



	Annie slips her hand into his.  It feels comfortable, 

	natural, right.



				 ANNIE

		    Sam?



	He looks at her.



				 ANNIE

		    It's nice to meet you.



	On Annie.



	On Sam.



	On Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist 

	gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.



	EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



	WE SEE THE BUILDING from above, all lit up, a romantic 

	confection, the world's largest Valentine.



	The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States 

	spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.



	And





	FADE OUT

          FADE IN:
          
          
          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          CLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard,
          in teacherly cursive.
          
          We PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful
          Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing
          out, "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"
          
          Starla glances at the classroom of high school students.
          She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking,
          but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the
          class.
          
                                   STARLA
                     When Darwin said 'fittest,' he
                     didn't necessarily mean the
                     strongest or the most intelligent,
                     or any one trait -- he merely meant
                     those organisms most well-suited
                     to their environment.
          
          The boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks.
          KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside
          her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits
          him. He CHUCKLES.
          
                                   STARLA
                     We humans think we're more fit,
                     more evolved, because we're smarter.
                     But we're neophytes. We've been
                     around two million years, give or
                     take. The cockroach has been here
                     for 350 million. You tell me who's
                     the more successful species.
          
          A BOY raises his hand.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Will.
          
                                   WILL
                     How's all this go with how the
                     Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?
          
          Some of the kids LAUGH at the boy.   Starla pauses, about
          to answer, when the BELL RINGS.
          
                                   STARLA
                     We'll tackle that tomorrow...
                     Everyone bring your boxing gloves.
          
          The kids start to leave.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Celebratory banners are strung over this street, including
          one that reads: "DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!" We're in the
          center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed
          small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and
          near crowd the streets in their massive pickups.
          
          MEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of
          ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand
          outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW
          TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his
          truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose.
          
          JACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving
          through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a
          hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic. Jack
          jams on his HORN.
          
                                  JACK
                    Get the fuck out of the way,
                    cocksucker!
          
          Jack turns to see a MOTHER and her two CHILDREN on the
          sidewalk, listening and staring in shock.
          
                                  MOTHER
                    Mornin', Mayor.
          
          Jack smiles, a bit embarrassed. Jack notices a group of
          HUNTERS on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something
          up in the sky.
          
          He looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth.
          
          
          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Students file out of the open door for the day. Kylie,
          Starla's pretty student, is among them. She and her FRIEND
          are looking up at the falling meteor.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Prolly go find it later, sell it
                    on eBay.
          
          
          EXT. HORSE RANCH - DAY
          
          A RANCHER with a cleft palate turns his head to see the
          meteor, much closer to him. It's rushing down toward the
          treetops of a nearby forest.
          
                                                                  3.
          
          INT. GRANT'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          A framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a
          large man is sitting on a desk. The photo TREMBLES
          LIGHTLY, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth.
          
          GRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties,
          notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from
          his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP.
          Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking
          relieved they didn't drop it.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Just a tremor, boys.
          
          Grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders
          with a Sharpie.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Four cops -- BILL PARDY, the town's young,   relaxed, and
          handsome Chief of Police, WALLY, an older,   toad-like cop,
          TREVOR, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and   MARGARET, a
          mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in   the station
          parking lot. They CHUCKLE.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Did ya' feel that?!
          
          They enter the station.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          The four cops start to remove their holsters and so forth,
          finished for the day.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I always get afraid when that
                    happens, 'cause what if the ground
                    cracks open and you fall inside?
                    It's so hot in there you get all
                    burnt to nothin' like that --
                          (snaps)
                    Happened to my uncle Barry.
          
          Wally and Bill LAUGH at him.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Who told you that story, Trevor?
          
                                    TREVOR
                    My aunt.
          
                                                                   4.
          
                                  BILL
                    Your uncle Barry left her for a
                    stripper up in Winnsboro.
          
          Trevor looks shocked, sad.
          
          SHELBY, a slightly dim dispatcher, on his headset at the
          police operator's unit, swirls toward them, alarmed.
          
                                 SHELBY
                    Chief! We got a 'mergency over at
                    the diner!
          
          
          INT. DINER - LATER
          
          The four cops move in.   There's a COMMOTION.   Most of the
          patrons are standing.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    Back there, Bill!
          
          The Waitress nods back through the service window, into
          the kitchen, where a large DOE is hopping around. A
          DISHWASHER stands on the counter, YELPING with fear.
          
          
          INT. DINER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill, Wally, Trevor, Margaret, and the Waitress enter.
          The doe skips around.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    She slipped in, was eating trash.
                    We seen it on TV, how they kill
                    ya'--
          
                                   BILL
                    Right.
          
                                  WAITRESS
                    So we thought we best call in.
          
          Bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer
          toward it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on now, honey, door's this
                    way.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    It's open season. Let's shoot
                    her.
          
                                  BILL
                    She's just scared, Margaret.
          
                                                                 5.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Also, Bill likes to take a female
                    through the back door any chance
                    he gets.
          
          Wally and Margaret LAUGH. Trevor snatches a dish-towel
          and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. The scared doe
          leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.
          
                                  BILL
                    She ain't a bull, Trevor!
          
          The animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Goddamn bambi-rat!
          
          As the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped
          in a telephone cord.
          
          The cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in
          place. Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for
          the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.
          
                                  BILL
                    Get back.
          
          The other cops step away.   Bill steps slowly toward the
          doe, speaking calmly.
          
                                  BILL
                    It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's
                    gonna hurt you.
          
          The doe looks at him, settling a bit.   His voice seems to
          be soothing her. Bill gets closer.
          
                                  BILL
                    That's right. Just gonna pull
                    this cord out. It's gonna be all
                    right.
          
          The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe,
          breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past
          her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.
          
          Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking
          Bill over, and streaks out the back door.
          
          Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway
          and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond,
          dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, she took a phone. Now them
                    forest critters are gonna be calling
                    us all hours of the night.
          
                                                                     6.
          
          Everyone LAUGHS.   Wally pretends to be on the phone.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Chief of police there? This a
                    squirrel. Bring me a bag of
                    peanuts, motherfucker!
          
          Everyone LAUGHS some more.
          
          
          INT. GLASS WORKSHOP - EVENING
          
          Grant locks his office for the day.   His SECRETARY sees
          him going.
          
                                  SECRETARY
                    'Night, Mr. Grant.
          
                                  GRANT
                    See ya', Ashley.
          
          Grant walks across the workshop toward the door. He sees
          a crowd of WORKERS lounging around a glass-cutting table,
          LAUGHING at something.
          
          Some of them nod at Grant, and he nods back.   But he's
          completely outside their circle.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          A sizable two-story suburban home.    All the lights are
          off but one.
          
                                  GRANT (O.S.)
                    So I get home today, phone's
                    ringing. It's Hank Wilcox.
          
          
          INT. GRANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla and Grant eat dinner in this well-decorated room.
          As Grant chatters, Starla occasionally smiles politely at
          him.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Callin' for you. What the hell?
                    I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit
                    outta line don't'cha think, a single
                    man callin' someone's wife?' At
                    night, nonetheless.
          
          Starla is quiet, almost afraid:
          
                                                                     7.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's teaching environmental science,
                    Grant. Probably wants to borrow
                    my lesson plans from last semester.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Oh yeah, that's what he wants to
                    borrow, this guy.
          
                                  STARLA
                    It's just a work thing.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Work thing hell, Starla. He just
                    wants to get in your pussy. Him
                    and most these other ones around
                    here. That's where their minds is
                    at, them sick fucks.
          
          Grant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're
                    lucky you got me. You're too damn
                    trusting. Without me to protect
                    you, you'd get kilt one of these
                    days.
          
          Starla nods.
          
          
          INT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - LATER
          
          Starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her
          hair. She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling.
          
                                  GRANT (O.S.)
                    Sugarplum, you coming into bed?
          
          Starla turns toward the door.       She doesn't say anything
          for a moment.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Just a second.
          
          Starla sets her brush down on the counter. She arranges
          it neatly beside the others. And walks into the bedroom.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant turns off the TV as Starla gets into bed with him.
          It's almost completely dark in here.
          
          Grant crawls on top of Starla. He kisses her and grabs
          her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without
          grace.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          After doing this for a few moments, Starla starts to push
          him off her.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just --
                    I'm not in the mood.
          
          Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Come on, baby, it's --
          
                                   STARLA
                    I'm sorry.   I don't just have some
                    switch.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Sure you do.
          
          Through Starla's nightgown, Grant pretends to flick one
          of her nipples.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Flip.
          
          Then the other.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Flip.
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's disrespectful.
          
          Grant, peeved, gets off of her. He sits on the edge of
          the bed for a moment, in silence. Starla looks afraid.
          
                                  GRANT
                    When are you in the mood, exactly?
                    Seems to me that mood's as rare as
                    winnin' the Goddamn lotto.
          
          Grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting
          them on.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Where are you going?
          
                                  GRANT
                    I'm just some big clown to you,
                    ain't I?
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's not true -- Where are you-?
          
                                   GRANT
                    Out.
          
                                                                9.
          
          INT. HENENLOTTER'S SPORTS BAR - LATER
          
          Grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila.
          He's getting drunk. He taps his glass.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hit me again there, killer.
          
          The BARKEEP fills his drink.
          
                                  BARKEEP
                    Hey, Grant, how's it you come to
                    have the same last name as first?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Parents thought it sounded pleasant,
                    I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?
          
          Grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup -- BRENDA
          GUTIERREZ -- staring at him from across the bar, smoking
          a cigarette. Grant stares at her, trying to figure out
          who she is. She slides off her stool.
          
          She sashays toward him. She props herself on the stool
          beside him, leans drunkenly in toward him.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Megan Halesy' little sister.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Shit.   You're kidding me.
          
                                      BRENDA
                    Nope.   Brenda!
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hell, you were --
          
          Grant holds his hand only so high.
          
                                 BRENDA
                    I was! And I'll tell you somethin',
                    Grant Grant. I's in love with
                    you.
          
          Grant stares at her.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    My sister Megan, she's a big fat
                    cow. Was then, even more so now.
                    I'd be thinking, what'd you see in
                    her ain't in me?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been
                    eleven.
          
                                                                  10.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Hell, I was game!
          
          She LAUGHS. So does Grant. He stares at her,
          contemplating sinful things. He nods at her wedding ring.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Who's the lucky fella?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn
                    half-Mexican.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Already ain't.     Married a gal named --
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Starla Covington. Don't be
                    ignorant. Everyone knows that.
                    Fucking prom queen.
          
          Grant thinks.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Yeah.
          
          Grant finishes his drink, and gets up to go.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Where you goin'?
          
          Grant speaks more loudly than need be:
          
                                  GRANT
                    Starla, she gets real worried 'bout
                    me I stay out too late. Loves me
                    too much, that one.
          
          He glances around to see if people have heard, and stumbles
          out.
          
          
          EXT. SHADED CREEK - LATER
          
          Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable,
          downing a six pack.
          
          He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances
          down and sees particles flowing down the river.
          
          Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the
          particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down
          between the trees.
          
          Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are
          coming.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water
          splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill.
          
          He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on
          the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater,
          but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost
          organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of
          the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing
          downstream.
          
          Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some
          sort of goo inside it. It's sticky.
          
          He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the
          crater itself and into the woods.
          
          Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail.
          
          He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something
          is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in
          closer.
          
          A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between
          the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high,
          gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around
          it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts
          and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret
          that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.
          
                                   GRANT
                    What the...?
          
          Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even
          frightened. He looks around for someone else.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo?
          
          No one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure.
          He picks up a tree branch.
          
          Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of
          the branch.
          
          Nothing happens.
          
          He does it again.   The thing pulses a little, and surges
          toward Grant.
          
          Grand pokes it again.
          
          A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity
          in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering
          and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as
          well.
          
          Grant slowly bends down to look at it when --
          
                                                                12.
          
          The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.   It strikes Grant in the
          stomach.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Ow!   Fuck!
          
          Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his
          abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears
          inside him.
          
          He clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back
          into the colorful flowers. His body convulses.
          
                                                        MATCH CUT TO:
          
          
          CAT SCAN SHOT - INT. GRANT'S BODY
          
          We see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half.
          We ZOOM IN on the little spore, which is jittering up
          through his body, and into his neck.
          
          The spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and
          his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front
          of him, silent. He's utterly still, a wax corpse.
          
          A hippie CAMPING COUPLE run into the area, looking for
          the source of the screams. The man looks down at the
          frozen Grant.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    Over here!
          
          The Camper crouches down beside him.
          
                                 CAMPER
                    Hey, man. You all right?...
                    Dude?... Oh shit.
          
          The Camper turns from Grant to his girlfriend.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    I think he's d --
          
          Grant GASPS suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man,
          like a drowning man popping up above water. The Camper
          YELPS and jumps back. Grant sweats and heaves, trying to
          speak, but hardly can --
          
                                  GRANT
                    It's taking... my... brain.
          
                                                                  13.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    Buddy?
          
          Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves
          there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if
          seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    You all right, man?
          
          Grant looks down curiously at the camper. Then he turns
          and stumbles away from them, out of the forest.
          
                                  CAMPER
                    That might of been a stroke, buddy.
                    You better take it easy.
          
          
          INT. GRANT'S PICKUP - DAWN
          
          Grant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck,
          sweating and blinking rapidly.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Grant steps out of the truck in his driveway, when he
          hears --
          
                                  NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                    Hey ya', Grant.
          
          Grant swings his head toward his NEIGHBOR, who is taking
          a happy BEAGLE for a morning walk.
          
                                  NEIGHBOR
                    What were ya', night-fishing again?
                    You catch anything?
          
                                  GRANT
                    I caught a little somethin', yeah.
          
          Grant walks inside his house.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MORNING
          
          Grant looks around the foyer.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Grant creeps into the bedroom, looking around.   We can
          hear the SHOWER RUNNING.
          
          Grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser. He
          moves in close to the mirror, and stares at his own image.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          He pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with
          excitement. He smiles at himself.
          
          Grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears
          the running shower. He creeps toward it.
          
          Grant peeks around the doorway. Starla is in the shower,
          soaping herself. She looks beautiful there. Grant tilts
          his head to the side like a dog. He watches her,
          mesmerized, even moved.
          
          
          INT.   GRANT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair
          in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears Air Supply's
          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD coming from the bedroom. She's
          struck by it.
          
          She moves toward the door.   Opens it.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          The shades are drawn, darkening the room. A few candles
          have been lit. Grant is standing there, mostly in
          silhouette. He's silent, and he doesn't move.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Hey there, sugarplum.
          
          Starla looks at him, stirred.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Haven't heard this for a while.
          
          Grant walks toward her. He takes her hand in his own,
          lifting it beside him. He wraps his other arm around her
          waist. And he slow dances with her. Starla dances too,
          a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.
          
                                   STARLA
                     I never danced in a towel before.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Wearing white, just like on our...
                     wedding day. I remember it.
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                   GRANT
                     I'm sorry about last night. I get
                     a little insecure sometimes, want
                     to hold on too tight. It's just
                     'cause you're precious to me,
                     Starla.
                                   (MORE)
          
                                                                15.
          
                                  GRANT (CONT'D)
                    But I swear to God, baby, I'm
                    turning over a new Goddamn leaf.
                    Okay?
          
          Starla nods, touched.    Grant's eyes are teary.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I love you, sugarplum.
          
          Starla and Grant kiss, tenderly.
          
          Grant falls to his knees in front of her. He runs his
          hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock,
          with as much fascination as lust. He pushes Starla back
          onto the bed.
          
          He lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little,
          scrapes his teeth on it. Starla is surprised by this,
          but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's
          had in years.
          
          Grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her
          breasts, her face. Starla's hand moves over Grant's back,
          and to his stomach. When she stops, startled.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, what's that?
          
          She gazes down at the wound between them, on Grant's bare
          abdomen, where the spore entered him. The wound is
          yellowish, and surrounded by veins.
          
          Grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Just a little bug bite is all.
          
          Grant kisses and munches on Starla as she lies back on
          the bed, enjoying it.
          
          O.S. HUMMING.
          
                                                             FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY
          
          Starla is HUMMING Every Woman in the World as she drops
          coins into a soda machine and chooses Tab. JANENE, a
          heavyset black teacher, notices this.
          
                                  JANENE
                    What are you so smiley about, girl?
          
                                    STARLA
                    Oh, nothin'.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          Starla grabs her soda and sits down with Janene.   Janene
          just stares.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Just, Grant and I had a nice
                     morning. It's been a while.
          
                                   JANENE
                     Oh! You got that fresh-fucked
                     glow, don't you?
          
                                    STARLA
                     Janene.
          
                                    JANENE
                     You slut.
          
                                    STARLA
                     Hush.
          
                                    JANENE
                     No shame.   You're a married woman.
          
                                   STARLA
                     He was... considerate. Maybe this
                     is the start of a real change in
                     Grant.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BATHROOM - DAY
          
          Grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso.
          The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is
          starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy
          bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout.
          A pus oozes out.
          
          Grant looks concerned. He squirts some Neosporin onto
          his fingers. He massages it slowly into the wound.
          
          
          INT.   GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around
          inside. He pulls out some bread. Some cheese.
          
          He opens the meat drawer. It's replete with cold cuts.
          He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney. Turkey. Pastrami
          and salami. He grabs every type of meat there is.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of
          bread and some cheese. He starts putting the meat on.
          But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a
          little sandwich tower.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          He looks at it. Something seems off about it. He removes
          the cheese. Better. And then the bread. Even better.
          He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Meat.
          
          After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and
          carries off the pile of meat.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant enters the garage through a door from the FOYER.
          He flips the lights on with his shoulder. He looks around.
          
          Grant spots an old file cabinet. He sets the tower of
          meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. It's
          filled with files. He closes that drawer, and opens
          another. It has manila file folders, but no files.
          
          Grant takes out the folders. He uses a Sharpie to write
          out "BALONEY" on a folder. Then he stuffs all the baloney
          into the folder and files it away.
          
          He starts writing out "PASTRAMI".
          
          
          LATER
          
          Grant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from
          "BALONEY" through "TURKEY." But he doesn't look satisfied.
          
          
          INT. SUPERMARKET - LATER
          
          Grant stands beside the butcher's counter with a shopping
          cart. He peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows
          of steaks, pork chops, and so on.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Meat.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to
                    the Deer Cheer this weekend?
          
          Grant snaps out of his reverie.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Sure thing, killer.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    What can I do you for?
          
                                                                18.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple
                    of these big ol' rib eyes.
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    How many you need?
          
          Grant stares at the steaks.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Well... having us a little dinner
                    party... I'd say... eight. No,
                    no... fourteen...
          
          The Butcher nods, starts to grab steaks.   Grant CHUCKLES.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Hell, what am I holding back for?
                    Why don't you just give me
                    everything you got here?
          
                                  BUTCHER
                    All the rib eyes?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Yep. And while you're at it, get
                    me a few of them chicken wings...
                    some pork loins... and, ooo, what's
                    this here? Osso buco?...
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - LATER
          
          Grant backs his pickup toward the garage. Meat is piled
          into the bed. Wrapped packages of meat fill the seats
          around him.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant stands in the garage, tearing open the packing, and
          letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor,
          muttering:
          
                                    GRANT
                    Meat.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a
          pile.
          
          SOMETHING skitters across the garage and around the pile.
          Grant peers around the pile and sees a RAT nibbling on
          some ribs. He realizes something.
          
                                                                  19.
          
                                     GRANT
                     You're meat.
          
          The rat moves away from Grant. But Grant snaps out his
          arm with alarming speed, snatching the rat. It SQUEAKS
          and wriggles in his grip, tearing and biting at him, trying
          to get free.
          
          Grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the
          pile of meat. Continues on.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Starla pulls into the driveway.     She presses the button
          on her garage door opener.
          
          The door SHUDDERS but stays closed.    Starla's confused.
          
          She gets out of the car and examines the door. She looks
          down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement
          driveway with bolts on both sides.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla enters the house. She heads toward a door along
          the wall that leads to the garage. There's a shiny new
          lock on that door as well. She touches it, baffled.
          
          She turns to see Grant standing at the end of the foyer.
          He's in shadows, a little spooky in the darkness.
          
                                     GRANT
                     Welcome home.
          
                                   STARLA
                     Grant? Why are there -- did you
                     put locks on the garage?
          
          Pause.   No answer.
          
                                   STARLA
                     You drilled into the driveway.
          
          Grant walks into the light.
          
                                   GRANT
                     Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got
                     so excited about... your present.
          
                                     STARLA
                     My present?
          
                                   GRANT
                     You're my princess, aren't you?
          
                                                                20.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Okay.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I got a super-special birthday
                    present for you this year. I
                    couldn't risk you finding it, so I
                    had to put them locks on the doors.
          
          Pause.
          
                                   STARLA
                    All right... I have to clean up
                    before dinner.
          
          Grant smiles at her. Starla confused, tries to smile
          back, then turns and heads up the stairs. Grant watches
          Starla's fine form from behind, somewhat lustily. But
          his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker,
          and he has a realization.
          
                                   GRANT
                    You're meat.
          
          Starla turns.
          
                                   STARLA
                    What?
          
          Grant snaps himself out of it.
          
                                   GRANT
                    Oh, nothin'.   Nothin'.   See you in
                    a sec.
          
          Starla smiles uneasily, and heads on upstairs.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant steps onto the front porch to get some air. He's
          blinking and seems a little dizzy. He gazes around the
          neighborhood:
          
          Down the way, a BOY in a little league uniform and his
          MOTHER get out of their car and walk toward the front
          door.
          
          Across the street, THROUGH A KITCHEN WINDOW, a PLUMP MAN
          and his WIFE are eating dinner.
          
          At another home, a SHORT MAN steps on a stepladder,
          changing the dome light on his porch.
          
          Grant stares at these individuals, looking like an animal
          ready to lunge at its prey, fighting the urge.
          
                                                               21.
          
                                      GRANT
                     Meat.
          
          He HEARS a BARKING. Grant turns to see the beagle next
          door, tied to the tree, YAPPING at him.
          
          Grant looks around to make sure no one's watching.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING
          
          Starla walks to get the paper in her robe, and she sees a
          BOY, aged thirteen or so, stapling a LOST: REWARD flyer
          to a telephone pole, with a picture of the beagle.
          
                                      STARLA
                     Roscoe's gone?
          
          The Boy's face is streaked from a long night of crying.
          
                                   BOY
                     You haven't seen him, have you?
          
          Starla shakes her head.
          
                                   STARLA
                     I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.
          
          The Boy nods, and walks to the next telephone pole to put
          up another flyer.
          
          
          EXT. SHADED FOREST - DAY
          
          Grant moves up a hill, between trees, looking around for
          something. He comes to a stop, trying to remember which
          way to go. He does, and moves on.
          
          
          EXT.   OLD BARN - LATER
          
          Grant comes upon an old wooden barn. The structure is
          maybe a hundred years old, and long abandoned. It's
          spattered with graffiti. Grant stares at it.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms.
          
          
          INT.   OLD BARN - LATER
          
          Grant spreads the plant life over the floor of the barn.
          He arranges it, fluffs it there. His actions are very
          animal-like when no one's around. He seems to be making
          a nest. He sits back, looks at it.
          
                                                                 22.
          
          He's happy.
          
                                                             FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla, dressed in her weekend finery, is looking in the
          mirror above her dresser, and putting on earrings.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, are you almost ready?
          
          
          INT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant looks ill. He is leaning over the sink, sweating,
          clutching his stomach.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!
          
          Grant turns and pushes open his door.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant sees Starla sitting on the edge of the bed, her
          back to him, as she puts on her nylons. She doesn't know
          he's there.
          
          Grant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward
          her, stalking her.
          
          Something starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach,
          like a bellybutton erection. The thing slips out of his
          shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's
          back.
          
          Grant looks at the nape of Starla's neck.    Her delicate
          ear. He becomes confused; he softens.
          
          Starla turns to see Grant, his body now turned away from
          her. He's trying to push the tubule back down.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What are you doing?
          
                                     GRANT
                    You're pretty.
          
          Starla nods, confused by his behavior.
          
                                                               23.
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - LATER
          
          A banner hangs across the front of the lodge, "DEER CHEER
          '05" -- the first Friday of deer season in Wheelsy.
          Inflatable deer totems decorate the front of the wooden
          lodge. RAMBUNCTIOUS MUSIC comes from inside. Partyers
          enter.
          
          Grant and Starla step out of his truck. As they do, one
          of Starla's students, Will, sees her and waves. Starla
          waves back.
          
          Grant notices this and grabs Starla's arm, a bit too hard,
          pulling her back.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Who's that?
          
                                  STARLA
                    It's just one of my students, Grant.
          
          Grant stares at the boy with distrust, and ushers Starla
          towards the lodge.
          
          Bill, Trevor and Margaret are hanging out on a large rock
          outside the entranceway, drinking beer. Bill watches
          Grant and Starla cross the lot. Trevor sees this.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What's she see in that douchebag?
          
                                  BILL
                    That's the mystery of the ages
                    there, Trev. Starla was seventeen
                    when they got engaged. He was,
                    like, in his thirties. No one
                    even knew they were goin' out till
                    she had that ring on her finger.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Ain't no mystery to it. She's
                    raised in them shanties off St.
                    Luc. Dirt-poor.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Gold-digger, huh?
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
          
          Margaret shrugs, BELCHES. Jack, the mayor, with his WIFE,
          stops beside them after she does, staring at her.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, you're Chief of police now.
                                  (MORE)
          
                                                                 24.
          
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                    Comes with some Goddamn
                    responsibility, like keeping your
                    people in line.
          
                                  BILL
                    You're right, Jack.    Margaret,
                    you're fired.
          
          Margaret and Trevor LAUGH. Jack shakes his head with
          disdain, and enters the party.
          
          
          INT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - NIGHT
          
          Wheelsy citizens celebrate.   A country-western band PLAYS.
          Couples two-step.
          
          Starla and Grant move through the party. Grant looks
          around at the dancing and laughing bodies. Starla sees
          her friend from school.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Janene!
          
          Janene LAUGHS heartily and the two embrace
          
                                  JANENE
                    Hey, Grant.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Why don't you two catch up? I'll
                    go see what the boys are doing.
          
          Starla nods. She and Janene watch as Grant moves off
          through the crowd.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's been strange the past couple
                    days.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Grant steps outside, and looks around.
          
          Across the parking lot is a playground. Two YOUNG CHILDREN
          are spinning on a little carousel there.
          
          Grant starts toward them.
          
          
          EXT. SADDLE LODGE PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
          
          The Children GIGGLE, unaware of Grant inching up on them.
          Grant gets closer, excited, when he hears:
          
                                                                 25.
          
                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    Hey there, handsome.
          
          Grant turns and see Brenda Gutierrez standing there.
          Once again, she's very drunk.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Must be fate, us meeting again
                    like this.
          
          Grant smiles.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Well, you might be right...
          
          Grant sees if anyone's watching.   He circles around her.
          
                                  GRANT
                    You're lookin' awful pretty.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Shut up.
          
          Brenda SNICKERS.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Where's the old half-Mexican?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Took the kids to his Mom's for the
                    weekend.
          
          Grant smiles.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Grant holds Brenda's hand, and he pulls her between the
          trees. She GIGGLES.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
          
          Grant stops in a secluded place, beside the creek, looking
          around. No one's there. He turns toward her, smiles.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Take off your shirt, doll.
          
          Brenda looks at him, confused.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Guess it's hard to explain how
                    amazin' a human brain is to someone
                    who that's all they know.
          
                                                                   26.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    What?
          
                                  GRANT
                    Stuff you can never imagine.
                    Feelings. Big thoughts. And love.
                    Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it
                    into somethin' more. So, go ahead
                    there, beautiful, and take off
                    your shirt.
          
          Brenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and starts
          unbuttoning her blouse. After a moment, she looks at
          Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it. Grant looks
          at her in her bra.
          
                                    GRANT
                    Nice.
          
          Grant unbuttons his shirt as well.    As he removes it
          completely, he turns toward her.
          
          Brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a
          veiny, blue-moss-encrusted yellow spout, huge and pulsing.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    Grant!?    What -- ?!
          
          Grant grabs her.    She tries to push his arms away.
          
                                    BRENDA
                    No, no, we --
          
          Brenda gets up, trying to run away. But Grant grabs her
          necklace, yanking her back. The necklace snaps and falls
          into the creek beside them.
          
          Grant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock.    She struggles
          to get free.
          
          Brenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing,
          tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound. She
          SCREAMS.
          
          Grant shoves his hand over her mouth, shutting her up.
          He's extremely strong. She watches as the tubule twitches,
          feeling its way like a blind snake.
          
          The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream
          down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.
          
          Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid --
          pumps through the tubule and into Brenda.
          
          Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms
          there beside him.
          
                                                                27.
          
          Then she falls back, unconscious.   The tubule retracts
          into Grant's torso.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE BACK PORCH - NIGHT
          
          Starla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the lights
          of the town below. She turns to see Bill lean on the
          rail beside her. She looks genuinely happy.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Hey, Bill!
          
          Starla catches herself, and looks around to see if Grant
          is watching.
          
                                 BILL
                    Don't worry. The lurker ain't
                    around. I checked.
          
                                  STARLA
                    That's not funny.
          
                                  BILL
                    Sorry.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Whatcha' doin'?
          
                                  BILL
                    Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm
                    too buff. Too much muscle mass.
          
          Starla LAUGHS.
          
                                  BILL
                    What you up to?
          
                                  STARLA
                    Just checking out the lights.
          
          Bill and Starla look out over the city together.
          
                                  BILL
                    Pretty, ain't they?
          
                                  STARLA
                    I don't know. I've seen them so
                    many times before. I guess any
                    spot gets boring after awhile.
          
                                  BILL
                    Well that's only if you're in the
                    wrong spot.
          
          Starla looks at him.
          
                                                                     28.
          
                                    BILL
                      There's a place over there on the
                      bluffs. When the fog is just right,
                      like tonight, the lights of Main
                      look like a kaleidoscope.
          
                                      STARLA
                      Oh, yeah?
          
                                    BILL
                      Mm hm. But only a few folks know
                      how to get there. Wally. Rollo
                      Linkski coulda taken you, but
                      'course he got hit by that train.
                      Me.
          
                                    STARLA
                      I'll get Wally to show me sometime
                      then.
          
            Starla LAUGHS out loud.   So does Bill.
          
                                    BILL
                      Oh, will you now?
          
                  STARLA                            GRANT (O.S.)
          Or Rollo's ghost.               Starla.
          
            They turn to see Grant approaching.     He's a mess.   His
            pants are streaked with mud.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Grant, where'd you go?
          
                                      BILL
                      Hey, Grant.
          
            Grant eyes Bill with suspicion.    He grabs Starla.
          
                                    GRANT
                      You ready, sugarplum?
          
            Starla nods.   She looks at Bill and mouths:
          
                                      STARLA
                      Bye.
          
            Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the
            rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him.
          
                                    WALLY
                      Surprised you're able to lift a
                      mug after carrying that torch for
                      so long.
          
                                                                 29.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey, Wally. Glad you're here.
                    There was something I wanted to
                    tell you...
          
          Bill SNAPS his fingers, trying to remember.
          
                                     WALLY
                    What?
          
                                     BILL
                    Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass.
          
          They both LAUGH.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Starla lies on her side, awake. She's staring at the
          dirt on Grant's pants, which are hung over a valet. Grant
          holds her from behind, sleeping peacefully.
          
                                                              FADE TO:
          
          
          INT. WHEELSY POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          The front door of the precinct opens, and a confused
          Mexican MAN walks inside. He is trying to keep from
          crying. Three half-naked children follow him, clutching
          onto his clothes. The man walks slowly through the office,
          looking around for help.
          
          Margaret sees him from her desk.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Sir, may I help -- ?
          
                                  BRENDA'S HUSBAND
                    My wife, Brenda. I think something
                    has happened to her!
          
          
          EXT. STOP SIGN - DAY
          
          Starla, in her car with groceries, comes to a stop sign.
          She looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that
          it's covered with flyers for missing pets.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla enters with a shopping bag.    The lights are off.
          CREEPY MUSIC plays.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
                                                                  30.
          
          No answer.    Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing
          happens.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Damn fuse.
          
          She passes the door to the garage, noticing the lock.
          
          
          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla sets down the bags on the counter, looks around.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant?
          
          Again, no one's here. She sees a potted flower on the
          counter. A green INCHWORM is crawling up the stem, little
          by little. She stares at it, as if it's a portent.
          
          She hears a MOAN, coming from upstairs.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her
          husband. It seems no one is here.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant, where are y -- ?
          
          Starla turns, when Grant POPS INTO FRAME. Starla,
          startled, SCREAMS. Grant is sick and trembling. But,
          worse, he's been transforming. There are small pustules
          all over his face.
          
                                    STARLA
                       Grant. Oh my God. What happened
                       to your -- ?
          
                                     GRANT
                       Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks,
                       sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here.
                       I had a reaction to a bee sting.
                       He gave me a prescription. Said I
                       should be fine, in a couple days.
          
          Starla stares at him, mute and horrified.
          
                                     GRANT
                       Don't look at me like that, baby.
                       Please? I'm gonna go get my...
                       prescription filled.
          
          Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his
          pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.
          
                                                                      31.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I'll get if for you.
          
                                       GRANT
                    No!   No.   Heh.     I'll be right back.
          
          He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - DAY
          
          It's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant
          putting meat into a garbage bag.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - DAY
          
          Grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he
          places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes
          it.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - EVENING
          
          Grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging
          the garbage bag.
          
          Grant comes upon the old wooden barn.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Grant enters. It is almost completely dark.          He hears
          WEEPING. CHAINS RATTLE.
          
          Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting
          on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS
          through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is
          horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous
          pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so
                    fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna
                    die.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Brought you munchies.
          
          Grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead
          animals out in front of her.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Been saving for a rainy day.
          
          CLOSEUP: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. She
          stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed.
          
                                                                 32.
          
          She looks up at Grant.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Grant, I'm sorry if I did something
                    wrong! I think I gotta -- I think
                    I should go to a hospital!
          
          Grant doesn't respond.    Brenda's eyes trail back down to
          the meat.
          
          Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested
          pork chop, pulling it toward her.
          
          We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the
          raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.
          
          
          INT. GRANT'S TRUCK - LATER
          
          Grant gets into his pickup; he trembles and YELPS as his
          body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform
          even more.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          There's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it
          open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried.
          
          Wally tries to see inside.
          
                                     WALLY
                    Grant around?
          
                                   STARLA
                    No.   He went to the pharmacy.
          
                                     WALLY
                    Pharmacy?
          
                                  STARLA
                    He's got a... rash.
          
          Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means
          something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across
          the street, talking to another neighbor.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
          
          Starla shakes her head.
          
                                  BILL
                    Maybe she's ever called the house,
                    or -- ?
          
                                                                  33.
          
                                     STARLA
                    No.   What...?
          
                                  BILL
                    She disappeared Friday night. We
                    got reason to believe foul play
                    might be involved.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Some kids found her necklace near
                    Tipper Creek, as well as what might
                    be her blood on a rock.
          
                                  BILL
                    The problem, Starla, is, the last
                    person anyone saw her talking to
                    was Grant.
          
          Starla looks at him, surprised.
          
                                  BILL
                    The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me,
                    we also saw him that night, with
                    mud all over his slacks.
          
          Bill hands her his card.
          
                                  BILL
                    Have him call me right away, okay?
          
          Starla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly before
          he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors'
          homes.
          
          Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked.
          
          She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage.
          Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what
          appears to be blood drop stains near the door.
          
          She gains courage, and moves off toward --
          
          
          INT. GRANT CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused
          sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the
          door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then
          she swings the bat at the lock on the door.
          
          She swings it again, GRUNTING.
          
                                                                 34.
          
          And again.
          
          Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door.
          
          Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to
          the floor.
          
          Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door
          into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench
          hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand,
          and enters.
          
          
          INT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of
          rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly
          divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground
          Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily
          insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She
          looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle,
          his tongue dangling out.
          
          Starla starts to CRY.
          
          She moves quickly back inside.
          
          
          INT. GRANT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla runs to the front picture window, and looks out
          onto the street. She can't see any of the cops.
          
          She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone.
          She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number.
          The phone RINGS, and:
          
                                     SHERRY (O.S.)
                       You've reached Chief Pardy at the
                       Wheelsy Police Department. Please
                       leave a message and your call will
                       be returned as soon as possible.
          
          There's a BEEP.    Starla tries to speak through her SOBS,
          pacing:
          
                                     STARLA
                       Bill, it's Starla!
          
          As Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't
          see Grant staring in at her, his face now that of some
          diseased cephalopod.
          
                                     STARLA
                       It's -- I think you better come
                       over right away -- I think Grant's
                       sick, he --
          
                                                                  35.
          
          Starla turns to see the monstrous Grant through the window.
          
          She just stops.   They stare at each other for a moment.
          
          And then Grant lets out a FURIOUS WAIL.
          
          Starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house.
          
          Grant disappears from the window.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          As Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the
          front door to make sure Grant isn't following.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALL - NIGHT
          
          She runs past a wall of family photos.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to
          the backyard.
          
          She arrives at it, and flings it open --
          
          Grant is there.
          
          He lunges onto her. Starla SCREAMS and drops the cordless
          phone, just as it starts RINGING. Grant crawls on top of
          her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he
          pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes.
          He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy.
          
                                  GRANT
                    Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant, no!
          
                                     GRANT
                    I loved you.     I loved --
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant, you're sick!
          
          Grant is about to cry.
          
                                  GRANT
                    I wanted you by my side, but you --
                    I can't trust you now!
          
          Starla's WEEPING, confused. Grant rips his shirt open.
          Starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the
          
                                                                36.
          
          now enormous yellow spore on Grant's chest. The tubule
          feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it.
          It starts to poke into her skin.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Noooo!
          
          Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She
          SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and
          surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from
          under him.
          
          Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer
          ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1.
          
          Grant thrusts the couch aside.
          
          Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from
          behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her
          back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as
          his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her
          like a snake.
          
          Starla gasps for air. Her face turns purple.   She hears
          a SLAMMING on the door.
          
                                   BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla?!!   Starla, are you in
                    there?!
          
          Starla tries to speak but she cannot.   Suddenly, we HEAR
          the FRONT DOOR OPEN.
          
                                   BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla?!
          
          Starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees
          Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living
          room.
          
          They are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased
          humanoid strangling Starla from behind.
          
                                   TREVOR
                    Fuck!
          
          The cops, freaked out, pull their guns. Grant makes a
          SCREECHING SOUND at them. They SHOOT at Grant, nicking
          him.
          
          Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows,
          SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor.
          
          Grant slips out the back door and away.
          
          The cops stare, gape-jawed and frozen with shock; what
          the hell was THAT?!
          
                                                                       37.
          
            Starla rubs her neck, COUGHING.
          
            Bill Pardy runs toward the back door.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
            Bill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind
            him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area.
            Grant is nowhere to be seen.
          
            We CRANE UP and AWAY from them as we...
          
                                                              FADE TO BLACK.
          
            O.S. SNIFFLING.
          
                                       PASTOR (O.S.)
                         Jesus, these past few days have
                         been a trying time for us.
          
          
            INT. CHURCH - DAY
          
            We PAN OVER an altar where family members have placed
            little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs,
            mementos, "Come home, Mommy" cards, etc.
          
                                       PASTOR (O.S.)
                         We ask you now for the safe return
                         of our beloved Brenda.
          
            Everyone in this modest little church has their heads
            bowed as the PASTOR leads the prayer service.
          
                                      PASTOR
                         Our sister. Our daughter.    Our
                         mother. Our wife.
          
            Brenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it, CRYING.
            His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats.
          
                                       PASTOR
                         And we ask that you keep your light
                         alive in her heart, wherever she
                         may be. We ask all this in your
                         name, Lord. Amen
          
            Bill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands.
          
                  BILL                               CONGREGATION
          Amen.                            Amen.
          
            Bill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the
            very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty.
          
                                                                38.
          
          He also sees a group of OLD CRONES nearby, pointing at
          Starla, and whispering about her.
          
          
          EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla's high heels CLACK on the pavement as she moves
          quickly to her car.
          
                                     BILL (O.S.)
                    Starla.
          
          Starla turns to see Bill coming after her.   She stops.
          
                                  BILL
                    I talked to the CDC. They didn't
                    have nothin' on file consistent
                    with Grant's... symptoms.
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                  STARLA
                    How about Brenda?
          
                                  BILL
                    New? No. We're hoping we find
                    Grant, he'll lead us to her.
          
          Starla nods. The wind is strong. Her hair is flying
          over her face. Tears come to her eyes.
          
                                     BILL
                    You all right?
          
          Starla nods.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Yeah.
          
          She moves away from him.
          
          Bill watches her go.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
          
          Bill enters. A few COPS and SECRETARIES are bustling,
          making phone calls, etc. They all look tired, as if they
          haven't slept. Jack, the mayor, sees Bill.
          
                                     JACK
                    Bill!
          
          Bill spots him, moving quickly toward him.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shit.
          
                                                                 39.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, we need to talk!
          
                                  BILL
                    'Mornin', Jack.
          
          Bill crosses the station.   Jack follows.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's
                    niece. We need to find Grant
                    yesterday! The town council has
                    lit a Roman candle and stuck it up
                    my ass!
          
                                  BILL
                    Hell, Jack, your leisure activities
                    ain't my business.
          
                                  JACK
                    Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your
                    post here as Chief is in dire
                    straits you don't work this shit
                    out.
          
          They come to a desk with Wally and Trevor working away.
          
                                  BILL
                    Don't worry, we'll find him.
                          (to Trevor)
                    Anything new?
          
          Trevor shakes his head.
          
                                  JACK
                    How are you going to find him?
          
                                  BILL
                    Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many
                    places he can hide. Sea World,
                    maybe.
          
          Jack sees a SECRETARY making copies nearby.    He speaks in
          hushed tones:
          
                                  JACK
                    That young lady heard you say
                    'squid.' She's gonna go out and
                    create a Goddamn hysteria!
          
                                  BILL
                    Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
          
                                  SHERRY
                    Not today, Bill.
          
                                                               40.
          
                                  JACK
                    Still, quit that talk! You yourself
                    said it was dark in there! You
                    don't know what you saw!
          
                                  TREVOR
                    We saw his arm was all bendy.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bastard obviously got lyme disease!
          
                                   BILL
                    What?
          
                                  JACK
                    Touch some deer feces out in the
                    forest. Eat a sandwich without
                    washing your hands. Then you got
                    lyme disease.
          
                                  BILL
                    And that makes you look like a
                    squid?
          
                                  JACK
                    I'll tell you what, no one with
                    lyme disease gonna win any damn
                    handsome contests!
          
          Bill, Wally, and Trevor can't help but SNICKER.
          
                                  JACK
                    Well, screw you all for laughin'.
          
                                   SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Bill!
          
          Bill looks over at Shelby, on his headset at the dispatch
          unit.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Another ranch attack!   Up at the
                    Castavets'.
          
          Bill nods for Trevor and Margaret to get up from their
          desks. They do, and start to move out with Bill and Wally.
          
                                   JACK
                    'Ranch a -'?   What 'ranch attacks'?
          
          
          EXT. CATTLE RANCH - LATER
          
          POV: A dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the long
          grass, its gut split open and intestines spilling out,
          almost perfectly symmetrical.
          
                                                                  41.

                       It looks like one of them psyche
                       tests. What do they call it?
          
          Bill and Wally are staring at the dog from above.
          
                                     BILL

                       What do you see? I see a butterfly.
          
          Bill moves on through the windswept weeds.
          
                                      BILL
                       I see we're fucked.   Three ranches
                       in three days.
          
          Margaret is taking measurements and writing in a note
          pad; she sees Bill.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So, I think I got it part-way
                       figured. You want to hear it?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So Grant -- I mean, we're saying
                       this is Grant, right?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       Grant kills a cow right about here.
                       See there's the blood, musta slit
                       its neck.
          
          Margaret walks backward, showing the trail of blood in
          the crushed grass.
          
                                     MARGARET
                       So he drags the cow backwards here.
                       Only he prolly didn't know 'bout
                       the Castavets had them dogs.
          
                                     TREVOR (O.S.)
                       Hey, look!
          
          Bill looks over at Trevor, standing up between the tall
          weeds, holding a dog's head in his hand.
          
                                     TREVOR
                       He knocked this'n's head clear
                       over here!
          
                                                                42.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Put that down, numbnuts!
          
          Bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    So the dogs attacked, somehow he
                    slew 'em all, and he stole off
                    with the cow into the forest.
          
          Trevor heads toward them. Bill looks off into the dark
          forest on the edge of the ranch.
          
                                  BILL
                    He's gotta be in the forest. All
                    three ranches run alongside it.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Think we should get up a search
                    party, head in there?
          
                                  WALLY
                    It's a hundred thousand acres. Be
                    finding a needle in a fuckstack.
          
          Bill has a realization.   He moves quickly for his car.
          
                                  BILL
                    Wally, come on. Trevor and
                    Margaret, get some folks together.
                    I think I know where he's gonna
                    hit next.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - LATER
          
          CLOSEUP: A property map of Wheelsy is tacked to a bulletin
          board. Red Magic Marker circles are around various ranch
          properties on the edge of the city, next to an enormous
          forest. A finger points to one of the red circles.
          
                                  BILL
                    So the night after Grant ran off,
                    a calf went missing from here, the
                    Raglans' ranch.
          
          REVEAL Bill, standing beside the bulletin board. A posse
          has gathered, listening intently: Wally and the usual
          cops; Jack; an OLDER COP, probably pulled out of
          retirement; and a couple of recruits -- a REDNECK and a
          GOOD OL' BOY. Bill points to the next red circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    Two nights ago, a mare was stolen
                    from this property, run by
                    Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with
                    the cleft palate.
          
                                                              43.
          
          Wally whispers to Margaret, amused:
          
                                  WALLY
                    Looks like a chipmunk.
          
                                  BILL
                    Your momma wasn't too proud when
                    you came out neither, Wally.
          
          Bill points to the next circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    And then we get here, the
                    Castavets', where last night's
                    shit-storm took place.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I see. It's like as if he's going
                    in a pattern. Is that what you're
                    saying, Bill?
          
          Bill nods and points to the next red circle.
          
                                  BILL
                    And if he sticks to that pattern
                    he'll be here next. Belongs to a
                    family, the Strutemyers'. Now I
                    know y'all are tired and you've
                    barely seen your families. But
                    we're gonna have to go there
                    tonight, lie low and wait.
          
          The posse nod, agreeing.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Let's get that son-of-a-bitch,
                    Chief.
          
                                  BILL
                    Just remember, we don't know what
                    we're up against here. So let's
                    be careful.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION/ARMORY - DAY
          
          Beside a small armory, Trevor loads a Benelli M-1 super
          semiautomatic shotgun. Margaret checks the site on a
          Remington 700 PSS rifle. Bill takes a Springfield M-1A
          pump-action for himself, while Wally stuffs numerous
          pistols and ammo into a leather satchel. Trevor notices
          a dusty grenade on a shelf.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we
                    confiscated from them jokers wanted
                    to use it fish for trout?
          
                                                                 44.
          
          Bill looks at Trevor, considering.
          
                                  BILL
                    Can't hurt.
          
          As Trevor puts the grenade into a side-pocket on the
          satchel, Bill sees Jack and the Older Cop, watching.
          
                                  JACK
                    I didn't know the Russkies were
                    invading there, folks.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    You seen this guy, you'd wished
                    they was.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER
          
          The posse loads up their vehicles, and start taking off
          out of the parking lot.
          
          Bill and Wally walk out to their police car.   Bill tosses
          the leather satchel into the trunk.
          
          They get in the car, Bill starts the engine, when --
          
          Starla Grant pulls quickly into the parking lot. Bill
          rolls down the window as she gets out of her car and runs
          toward them.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Bill, I heard what you're doing.
                    I think I should go along.
          
                                 BILL
                    Why? Listen, it doesn't matter.
                    I gotta go.
          
          Bill starts to roll away, but Starla holds on to the car,
          following.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's
                    still out there, how will you find
                    her? How, unless you bring Grant
                    in alive? Your best chance of
                    doing that is with me. I can talk
                    to him --
          
                                  BILL
                    He tried to kill you, Starla.
          
                                  STARLA
                    He did. I know. But I got him
                    angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This
                    time I could --
          
                                                                      45.
          
          Starla's on the verge of tears.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Please, Bill. What happened, it's
                    my fault, I know it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, it ain't --
          
                                  STARLA
                    It is. He'd been acting strange.
                    And the physical changes. I should
                    have told someone right away...
                    But I was just blind. I wanted to
                    pretend it wasn't happening... If
                    I don't do what I can to help now,
                    I just couldn't live with it.
          
          Bill looks at her.   He looks at Wally.     Wally shrugs.
          
          Bill nods for Starla to get in.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER KITCHEN - EVENING
          
          Kylie is blowing on a cup of coffee. Her MOM, DAD, and
          two younger SISTERS, aged 9 and 11, are relaxing after
          dinner. As Kylie's Mom picks up plates --
          
                                 KYLIE'S MOM
                    Kylie! What'd you do to your
                    fingers?
          
          Kylie's Mom grabs her hand, looking at her very long
          fingernails. They're painted sky blue and spotted with
          minute teddy bear and bumblebee decals.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Kiri Goshima done 'em.    She's
                    Japanese.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Looks like Pokemons done 'em to
                    me!
          
          Kylie's sisters LAUGH out loud.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Foreign stuff is classy if you
                    knew something.
          
          Kylie's family sees, OUT THE WINDOW, police cars pulling
          up by a gravel road.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all
                    to stay inside tonight. All right?
          
                                                                  46.
          
          Kylie's sisters nod.   Kylie too.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER FARMHOUSE - EVENING
          
          Kylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint
          family farmhouse. He sees Jack heading toward the ranch,
          and waves. Jack gives a little salute, while muttering
          to the Older Cop.
          
                                  JACK
                    This turns out to be a mountain
                    lion we're gonna look like a damn
                    bunch of idiots.
          
          The Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch
          as well. They see Bill with Starla.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Didn't know it was date night.
          
          The Good Ol' Boy LAUGHS.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    I'll be expecting you toss my salad
                    at the end of all this then,
                    Charlie.
          
                                     GOOD OL' BOY
                    Shut up.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle
          graze, finding places to hide. The sun sets behind them.
          
                                                            FADE TO:
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful,
          pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister.
          
          The wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds.
          
          A rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and
          CLINKS on its half-bent perch.
          
          A piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING
          incessantly against the wooden wall.
          
          Trevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and
          Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch,
          waiting, watching or dozing.
          
                                                               47.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and
          it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill
          peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the
          trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side
          as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she
          snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her.
          
          Bill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's
          embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she
          wants to be.
          
          They sit there for a moment in the dark.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey, Starla, remember that time
                    when you were a kid and you came
                    knocking on my window in the middle
                    of the night?
          
          Wally looks at them.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla here's twelve. Guess I was
                    fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what
                    the hell you doing out there?'
                    She tells me she's running away to
                    Hollywood to become a big star.
                    She said she knew I was in ROTC,
                    and she was gonna need a bodyguard.
                    Invited me along.
          
          Wally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but
          grudgingly enjoys the story.
          
                                  BILL
                    I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody
                    can take care of herself, I think
                    it's you. I'm gonna have to
                    decline.'
          
                                  WALLY
                          (to Starla)
                    How far'd you get?
          
                                  STARLA
                    About the bus stop. Ranger Rick
                    here called my dad.
          
                                  WALLY
                    Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You
                    son-of-a-bitch!
          
                                  STARLA
                    You fucked up our fame and fortune,
                    Bill Pardy.
          
                                                               48.
          
                                  BILL
                    Yeah, maybe I did.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the
          cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown
          off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass,
          trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls
          forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and
          sees...
          
          A large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the
          edge of the forest.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the
          forest. He has transformed into something much more
          monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump
          of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various
          tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown
          eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease,
          he now seems to BE the disease itself.
          
                                    STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across
          the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out
          prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers:
          
                                  JACK
                    You said 'squid'!
          
                                    TREVOR
                    It got worse.
          
          The Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped.
          
          The diseased Grant slithers through the grass just a few
          feet beside Margaret and the Older Cop. They duck below
          the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart
          attacks.
          
          Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of
          protest when he gets too close, and steps back.
          
          The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into
          the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking.
          Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over.
          
                                                                49.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless.
          
                                  WALLY
                    What we gonna do now, Bill?   Cuffs
                    won't even fit on 'im.
          
          Starla musters courage.   She stands, and moves out of the
          barn.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, where you...?
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts
          dragging it back in the direction of the forest.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Margaret motions to Trevor.
          
          Trevor motions to the recruits.
          
          And Starla moves slowly in toward Grant.
          
                                    STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes.
          His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a
          wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up,
          their guns at the ready.
          
          Starla moves even closer.   Bill and Wally are coming in
          close behind her.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Grant?   It's okay.
          
          As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost
          scared. His eyes dart around from cop to cop.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You're just sick is all. But we'll
                    take you to get help right now.
                    I'll stay by your side, Grant,
                    just like I swore I would. For
                    better or worse. Remember?
          
                                                                 50.
          
          Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Okay?
          
          The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle.
          
          Grant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest.    All of the
          posse stop, terrified.
          
          Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross
          breathing. Deep: In, out.
          
                                     STARLA
                     Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all
                     right.
          
          Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla
          to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.
          
          Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away.
          His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again
          drags it toward the forest.
          
          While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy
          nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at
          him.
          
                                   GOOD OL' BOY
                     You stop right there, you son of a
                     bitch. I don't care what kinda
                     leprosy you got. We need to find
                     that girl. Now you can make this
                     peaceful, or you can make it hard.
          
          Pause.   Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other.
          
          And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up
          the front of the man's body, and back.
          
          The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly
          in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two
          different sides of his split head look down in disbelief
          as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he
          topples over.
          
                                     BILL
                     Fire!   Fire!
          
          The posse SHOOT at Grant.    Starla covers her head.
          
          Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the
          cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the
          forest.
          
          Bill and the other posse members take off after him like
          hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          Starla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods.
          
          Starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she
          darts off after them.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is running a bath.    She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the
          distance.
          
          She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to
          see where the shots are coming from.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          The posse run through this very dark forest after Grant,
          leaping over brush and rocks. They're nervous, but also
          excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. Their
          eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust.
          
          They're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses --
          a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing
          around brush.
          
                                     WALLY
                    There he is!     Over there!
          
          They FIRE at the creature, taking chunks out of trees,
          but missing. He's too fast.
          
          
          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
          
          Grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek,
          and into the plentiful trees beyond. He rustles thick
          fronds as he moves up alongside the creek.
          
          The posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to
          peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant.
          
          Jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek.
          He cuts his knee on a sharp rock. He stands, and keeps
          going.
          
          They come to --
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
          
          The posse come up out of the creek. They've completely
          lost track of the diseased man-beast.
          
          They stop, out-of-breath and looking around.   They whisper:
          
                                                                 52.
          
                                     TREVOR
                    Where'd he go?
          
                                  MARGARET
                    We ain't never gonna find that
                    girl now.
          
          The Redneck is WEEPING with rage.
          
                                  REDNECK
                    I'll kill that asshole what he did
                    to Charlie.
          
          Bill sees Starla run up behind them.    He waves her back.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, get the hell out of here!
          
          Starla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave. She
          watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around,
          searching for some trail of Grant.
          
          Margaret looks down into the bubbling creek. She sees
          it's turning red. She looks up the trail of red, which
          is rippling downhill in the water. The red flow starts
          somewhere near a boulder.
          
          Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder.
          Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up
          on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a
          shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed,
          lifts a tentacle.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Bill!!
          
          Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He
          falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.
          
          Bill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already
          slithering swiftly back into the thick brush.
          
          The posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          The posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to
          be confronted by a terrible odor. They cover their noses
          and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell's that smell?
          
                                  WALLY
                    It's something dead.
          
                                                                 53.
          
          The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant
          had brought Brenda.
          
                                  JACK
                    It's coming from in there, ain't
                    it?
          
          Margaret looks at Bill.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Think he's inside?
          
          Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn.
          
          The posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they
          get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes.
          Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't
          react to the stench at all.
          
          Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens.
          Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and
          Wally exchange a look.
          
          Bill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the
          door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to
          open it. Starla watches all this from the rear.
          
          Margaret swings open the door.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside.   But
          they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.
          
                                    BILL
                    Oh...
          
          It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little
          head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is
          what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is
          nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from
          the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes,
          slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be
          slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The
          woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin
          are stained with blood.
          
          The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are
          equally astounded.
          
                                    OLDER COP
                    Oh, shit!
          
          They see the source of the awful stench:
          
                                                                 54.
          
          Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and
          horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as
          they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with
          flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces
          with the bottom of their shirts.
          
          The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Something's wrong with me.
          
                                    WALLY
                    Uh, yeah.
          
          Bill and Wally get in a little closer.
          
                                    BILL
                    Brenda, um...
          
                                  BRENDA
                    I didn't want no one to be seeing
                    me like this.
          
          As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly
          LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is
          trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in
          agony.
          
          The posse jump back.    They stare as she recomposes herself.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    How are my boys, Bill?    Are they
                    all right?
          
                                  BILL
                    Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's --
                    what's happening here, exactly?
          
                                  BRENDA
                    I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm
                    so hungry. I just never knew
                    anybody could be so hungry.
          
          Brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy
          into giving her candy. This is creepy as hell.
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Would you mind handing me a piece
                    of that possum there at your feet?
                    Little bit?
          
          Trevor gags and runs out of the barn.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor vomits into some bushes.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill eyes poor Brenda.
          
                                  BILL
                    I think we best get you to a
                    hospital right quick.
          
                                  WALLY
                    What the fuck they gonna do with
                    her in a hospital, Bill?
          
          Again, Brenda SCREAMS.    Her body LURCHES FORWARD.
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Why's she doing that?!
          
                                  REDNECK
                    Her tumors is moving.
          
                                  JACK
                    Bill, get her to stop that shit!
          
                                     BRENDA
                    It hurts!
          
          Her body lurches forward AGAIN.     She sobs.
          
                                     BRENDA
                    Help me!!     Help!!
          
          And then AGAIN. Starla notices that Brenda's skin is
          starting to SPLIT AND TEAR on her side.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Bill!
          
                                  BRENDA
                    Little fuckers are tearing me
                    aparrrr- !
          
          Brenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births
          at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in
          quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out
          one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling.
          
                                  BILL
                    He led us here.
          
          And then Brenda's body BURSTS OPEN COMPLETELY, like a
          water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little
          SLITHERING EYELESS PARASITES with slippery black-red skin
          like slugs spill forth. The horrid creatures, eight inches
          long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse,
          completely covering them before they can react.
          
                                                               56.
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the
          barn. The parasites are especially drawn to the posse's
          heads. Because there are so many, the weight of the beasts
          knocks most of them down.
          
          Trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway,
          covering him like lava in One Million B.C., and he buckles.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          A parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth.
          He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and
          his body starts to spasm.
          
          Jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too
          slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. His body,
          too, convulses, and he spits up blood.
          
          Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of
          the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their
          eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the
          things oozing up Margaret's neck.
          
                                  BILL
                    Margaret, cover your mouth!
          
          Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to
          slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone:
          
                                  BILL
                    Don't let 'em in your mouths!
          
          One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he
          slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.
          
          Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the
          parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls
          back onto the floor.
          
          A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when,
          suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to
          the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla.
          
          Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand
          firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites
          away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his
          free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies
          and faces as closely together as possible so the things
          don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them,
          flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight
          their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to
          himself and Starla.
          
                                                                 57.
          
          Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and
          begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off
          the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.
          
          Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from
          Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.
          
          She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering,
          holding her shirt over her mouth. They gaze out the front
          door of the barn.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands. He spits
          violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They wanted us to eat 'em!   Why
                    would they want that!?
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at
          Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton
          spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous
          bloody tiger rug.
          
          He looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled
          positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still
          lightly convulsing.
          
          He gazes out INTO THE FOREST to see the parasites rushing
          away like an ugly wormy army, shaking the brush as they
          head off in different directions.
          
                                                               CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto
          the ranch. The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath. Her head is back,
          her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water. The tub
          faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking
          to the wood siding.
          
                                                                       58.
          
            INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
            Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry
            sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still.
          
            There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward
            the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the
            window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail.
          
                                     KYLIE'S MOM
                      Kylie! You're gonna turn into a

                                      KYLIE
                      Prune, Mom.    Plums turn into prunes.
          
          
            INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
            Kylie's Mom is at the bathroom door.
          
                                    KYLIE'S MOM
                      I know what turns into what. You
                      got school tomorrow. Finish up in
                      there and get to bed.
          
            O.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement.
          
            Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door.
          
            She KNOCKS once, then opens the door to --
          
          
            INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
            Kylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading
            Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards.
          
                                    KYLIE'S MOM
                      Time to turn in, ladies.
          
                                    KYLIE'S SISTER 1

                      Come on now.
          
            The girls SIGH in lazy protest, but still turn off their
            reading lamps.

          Night, Mom.                     Night.

          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Kylie's Mom start to close the
          door.
          
                                   KYLIE'S MOM
                    Sleep tight.   Don't let the bed
                    bugs bite.
          
          Numerous parasites slither INTO FRAME, up the side of the
          house, approaching the girls' bedroom window, which is
          open a few inches for air.
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's Mom shuts their door completely. The girls turn
          on their sides and close their eyes to sleep.
          
          And the parasites pour in through the cracked window.
          They slither over the walls. Their slimy black-red bodies
          contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper.
          
          
          INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          The door cracks open, and a parasite enters.   It slithers
          silently over the linoleum tiles.
          
          It arrives at the base of the tub, and crawls up the side.
          
          Kylie continues relaxing, her eyes closed. She doesn't
          see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet.
          
          Kylie hears a SOFT SPLASHING and peers down. She spots
          the creature swimming toward her between her knees.
          
          Kylie SHRIEKS and scrambles up to get out of the tub.    As
          she clamors out, she slips and falls to the floor.
          
          The parasite squirms up Kylie's wet naked back. Kylie
          SHRIEKS again, jumping up as she tries to slap the thing
          off.
          
                                   KYLIE
                    Mom!!
          
          The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab
          it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing
          slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it.
          
          Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her
          long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there,
          digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it
          from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps
          its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her.
          
                                                                  60.
          
          Kylie falls to her knees. Her eyes roll back in her head,
          and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the
          very tip of the parasite's tail.
          
          We TRACK IN to a CLOSEUP of Kylie's face: a slight white
          electrical-telepathic charge can be seen SPARKING inside
          her mouth.

          KYLIE'S VISION
          
          We are RUSHING through some amoebic landscape, PAST
          microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to:
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - CREATURE'S POV
          
          Perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth. Its
          eyesight is not like our own; it's in grainy black and
          white and amber outlines. Various images FLASH in quick
          succession, including the following:
          
          -- We are on top of an alien ANIMAL, pinning it down.    It
          HOWLS beneath us as we tear into its flesh, feasting.
          
          -- All around us, diseased monstrous BEASTS feed on more
          alien animals. They lunge toward them and pin them down,
          ripping them apart, like some National Geographic
          documentary shot in Hell.
          
          -- In FAST MOTION, unfamiliar plant life around us grows
          sick and withers, dying out.
          
          -- A group of diseased monstrous beasts CRY OUT in uniform
          pain. They buckle to their knees; now they're dying.
          
          -- The diseased beasts feed on their own appendages.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          Kylie tries to regain control of her mind. Her eyes fight
          against flipping back in her head. Tears pour down her
          face. She pulls the parasite out just a bit.
          
          But then it SLAMS back into her and there are more SPARKS
          inside her mouth --
          
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - MANGLED INSECT POV
          
          -- We are CLIMBING UP through a creamy, gelatinous yellow.
          An opening slit widens in front of us, and we see Grant
          slowly bending to look at us, the forest behind him.
          
                                                                61.
          
          KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - GRANT'S POV
          
          -- We watch Starla soaping herself in the shower.
          
          -- We make love to Starla, our hands on her face.
          
          -- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with
          our tubule.
          
          -- We see the posse members coming in toward us.
          
          
          BACK TO SCENE
          
          With a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted
          worm, pulling it fully from her mouth. It flaps in her
          fingers. Kylie spits up blood.
          
          Kylie tosses the parasite away from her. Though slightly
          crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her.
          
          Kylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged
          in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it
          into the wormy thing.
          
          The parasite SQUEAKS and trembles with pain. Smoke rises
          from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning
          it, and, finally, killing it.
          
          Kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it.
          The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal.
          
                                      KYLIE
                    Mom!!!
          
          Kylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes
          lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and
          into --
          
          
          INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Kylie runs to the stairway.
          
                                      KYLIE
                    Mom!!    Mom!!!
          
          Kylie stops. Dozens of the things are slithering up the
          stairs and up the handrail towards her.
          
          O.S. Kylie hears her SISTERS' SCREAMS.   She looks in their
          direction, running toward their room.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    Emily!!    Jenna!!
          
          Kylie tosses open her sisters' door.
          
                                                                  62.
          
          INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a
          parasite sticking out of her mouth. Her eyes are rolled
          back. Her arms flail spastically. The slithering beast
          wags its tail as it disappears down her throat.
          
          Kylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with
          parasites crawling up her body. She's SCREAMING bloody
          hell, trying to slap them off.
          
          Kylie runs toward her to help. Kylie slaps the parasites
          off her sister. But there's too many and they're too
          fast. They slide into her sister's mouth.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    No!!   Nooo!!
          
          Her sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing
          disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood.
          
          Kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her.
          There's a clear path toward a window. Kylie runs to the
          window, and shoves it open. As the things approach her,
          she crawls out --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE AWNING - NIGHT
          
          Kylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the
          front porch. She turns to see the parasites slithering
          out towards her. She looks down. It's probably too far
          to jump, but she has no choice.
          
          So she jumps down onto --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
          
          Kylie lands, hard, tumbling over.
          
          She glances back at the front of the house.
          
          THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes
          rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood.
          
          More parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the
          grass.
          
          She spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway
          in front of her. She breaks for it.
          
          She throws open the front door, and jumps inside.
          
          The things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries
          to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck
          in the door jamb.
          
                                                                    63.
          
          They SQUEAK in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward
          her.
          
          So she SLAMS the door AGAIN, and AGAIN, and she slices
          the little bastards in half.
          
          
          INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Kylie makes sure none are inside.
          
          She feels for the keys in the ignition.    There aren't
          any.
          
          The creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows,
          trying to get in. Slithery shadows cover over Kylie,
          leaving her in almost complete darkness.
          
          Kylie crouches down in on herself, and WAILS.
          
          
          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Starla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken.
          All three seem to be in some mild state of shock.
          
          Bill, suppressing his desperation, is trying to make
          contact on his police radio.
          
                                  BILL
                    11-41. We're gonna need paramedics
                    out here right away. We got four
                    men down.
          
          Bill listens for a response, but there's only STATIC.      He
          presses the button again.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, you there?
          
          Still, only STATIC.    Bill tries another frequency.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an
                    emergency here.
          
          STATIC.
          
                                    BILL
                    Goddammit.
          
          Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get
          reception. Trailing off:
          
                                    BILL
                    Shelby?
          
                                                                 64.
          
          Starla sees Wally's body on the floor. His skin is white
          and corpse-like. His mouth is streaked with blood. Starla
          crouches beside him, and takes his pulse. Her hands are
          visibly shaking.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Is he alive?
          
          Starla looks at Margaret, and nods.
          
                                     MARGARET
                    Praise Jesus.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking
                    pushing it, Margaret.
          
          Trevor looks about to cry.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell were those things?!
                    You ever seen anything like that?
                    You ever heard of anything like
                    that?
          
          Margaret shakes her head.    Trevor looks at Starla, who
          also shakes her head.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Me neither. And I watch 'Animal
                    Planet' all the fuckin' time!
          
          Bill re-enters.
          
                                  BILL
                    No reception out here.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Bill, I'll run out to your car,
                    call for paramedics from there.
          
                                   MARGARET
                    That's a long ways. Them worms
                    are out there.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I'll keep my mouth covered.
          
                                  BILL
                    No. I'll go. The three of you,
                    you wait here. Get these folks,
                    out of the barn. The stench and
                    rot can't be any good for 'em.
          
          Margaret and Trevor nod.    As Bill starts to leave, Starla
          grabs him.
          
                                                               65.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Be careful, Bill.
          
          Bill nods. Makes a feeble attempt at a smile.   He jogs
          off into the forest.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying
          to remember which way he came from.
          
          He gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and
          spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage. A couple
          more deer and a fawn are eating as well. Bill looks at
          them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope...
          
          And then a parasite crawls up the deer's neck and slithers
          into its mouth. Parasites crawl up the bodies and necks
          of the deer behind it. The deer buck and flounce and
          scratch trying to get the things off of them.
          
          Bill runs away as fast as he can.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          Trevor and Margaret carry Jack out of the barn. He's
          bloated, corpse-like and covered in varicose veins.
          Margaret is wearing a gag-like swatch of clothing tied
          around her mouths, to protect themselves. Trevor's gag
          is down around his chin so he can chatter.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    It's got to be some Goddamn
                    biological weapons. Government's
                    testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who
                    gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears,
                    right?!
          
          They set down Jack and head back toward the barn.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    I hope it ain't contagious. I'll
                    be pissed as hell I turn into a
                    big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I
                    swear to God.
          
          Starla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside Wally, who
          is similarly sick and bloated. His lips are parched and
          cracking.
          
          Starla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto
          Wally's lips. Then she stands, and heads toward the creek.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          She doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her. He sits
          up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels
          down beside the water.
          
          Starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re-
          wetting it.
          
          She stands, and turns, only to see Wally directly in front
          of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered
          in darkness.
          
                                   WALLY
                     Hey, sugarplum.
          
          Pause.   Starla pulls the gag from her mouth.
          
                                      STARLA
                     What?
          
          Wally speaks with Grant's cadence.
          
                                   WALLY
                     Marriage. It's a sacred bond.
                     Just like you said.
          
          Starla stares at him.   Wally almost looks weepy.
          
                                   WALLY
                     I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle
                     you and all. I lost -- Lost my
                     head. I didn't want to do none of
                     the things I done. Not kill them
                     pets. Not make Brenda a womb.
                     But it's my nature, ain't it? How
                     can you blame a one for actin'
                     according to his nature?
          
          Starla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him.
          
                                   WALLY
                     I wanted to tell you what was going
                     on. But I didn't - didn't think
                     you'd love me no more. I never
                     knew... love, Starla, I --
          
          Trevor and Margaret are setting down the Older Cop.   They
          see Wally standing. Margaret pulls down her gag.
          
                                      MARGARET
                     Wally?
          
          Wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal.
          
                                      MARGARET
                     You all right?
          
          Wally doesn't answer.
          
                                                                  67.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Maybe you better sit back down.
                    You don't look so good.
          
                                   TREVOR
                    Margaret.
          
          Trevor's staring at something. Margaret follows his eye
          line. Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at
          her, just like Wally.
          
          The Redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring
          at them.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE/INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are
          clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as
          they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in
          the car, trembling, afraid to leave.
          
          She HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her
          sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home.
          They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts
          are stained with the blood they spit up.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
                    out.
          
          Her family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with
          their milky eyes. Her youngest sister pushes her face up
          close to the window.
          
                                   KYLIE'S SISTER 2
                    Hi, Kylie.   It's me.
          
          Her family tries the door handles, but they're locked.
          
                                  KYLIE'S MOM
                    Open the door, sweetie. I know we
                    don't look so good, but your mommy
                    and daddy love you.
          
                                   KYLIE
                    Get away!!
          
                                  KYLIE'S MOM
                    Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why
                    not to be with your family. This
                    is family fun day, isn't it?
          
          They continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over.
          They SLAP the windows.
          
          Kylie SOBS.   Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice:
          
                                                                    68.
          
                                  KYLIE'S SISTER 1
                    Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-
                    ance.
          
          Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries
          it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield
          CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST NEAR STRUTEMYER'S - NIGHT
          
          Bill, out of breath, runs out of the forest --
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or
          six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the
          field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked.
          Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.
          
          Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased
          Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now,
          smashing the pickup's windows.
          
                                  BILL
                    Hey!
          
          The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing.   They turn toward him.
          
          Kylie sees Bill through the rear windshield.    She unlocks
          the door, and jumps out of the car.
          
                                  BILL
                    What's -- ?
          
          Kylie runs past her family and up to Bill.    She grabs
          onto him, and hides behind him, WEEPING.
          
                                  BILL
                    What's going on here?
          
          Kylie's Dad's cadence is also like Grant's:
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Well, hello there, Pardy.
          
                                  BILL
                    What happened to you, Dwight?
          
          Kylie's Dad looks down at his own bloated arm.
          
                                  KYLIE'S DAD
                    Poison ivy out back, maybe?
          
                                                                   69.
          
                                   KYLIE'S SISTERS
                    We're itchy!
          
          Kylie is obviously in shock.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    They're not my... They killed...
          
                                 BILL
                    Okay. Y'all just wait in this
                    spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics
                    for you. Kylie can come with --
          
                                  RANCHER (O.S.)
                    Hey there, killer.
          
          Bill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now
          diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill,
          knocking him down.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS. Her family runs in toward them. She looks
          around to see a couple more DISEASED RANCHERS rushing
          toward them through the fields.
          
          The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the
          shovel to bring it down again.
          
          Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the
          dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger.
          
          The BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot.    He buckles.
          
          Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased
          folks rush toward them through the fields.
          
                                   BILL
                    Come on.
          
          Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the
          diseased chase them.
          
          
          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
          
          The infected posse -- Wally, Jack, the Older Cop, and the
          Redneck recruit -- are all coming in towards Trevor and
          Margaret.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just
                    sit down! You need to get some
                    Goddamn rest! You're sick!
          
          Starla watches this, by herself, next to the creek.      She
          eyes a rifle in the dirt.
          
                                                               70.
          
          Jack grabs a fistful of Trevor's hair and restrains his
          arms. Wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and
          tosses them into the dirt.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Let go!!
          
          Margaret goes to grab her pistol, when the Redneck opens
          his mouth wide and --
          
          GLEEKS; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream
          shooting out of the back of his throat. The glob SPLASHES
          on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    It burns!!
          
          Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into
          her skin. The hand is swelling monstrously. It's soft.
          Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone.
          
                                  MARGARET
                    What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!
          
          Jack opens his mouth and GLEEKS too -- shooting the stream-
          glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again,
          grabbing onto her neck.
          
          Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe,
          as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Meat.
          
          The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy
          flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. He
          stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.
          
          As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members
          turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor. The Redneck
          opens his mouth at him, when --
          
                                  STARLA (O.S.)
                    Let him go!
          
          The posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over
          to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing
          the rifle at the posse, trembling.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Trevor, come on.
          
          Surprised, they release Trevor.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What'd you do to her?!
          
                                                                      71.
          
            Jack stares at Starla.    He too speaks with Grant's cadence.
          
                                    JACK
                      There you go, sugarplum! Why you
                      choosing camps 'fore you hear --
          
                  JACK                            REDNECK
          Both sides of the story!?       Both sides of the story!?
          
                                    STARLA
                      Why are you talking like Grant?!
          
            The posse moves toward her. Starla is CRYING. The posse
            makes a COLLECTIVE SCREECHING sound, then speaks again:
          
                                    WALLY
                      'Cause I am Grant!
          
                  WALLY                           REDNECK
          I'm you husband --              I'm you husband, Goddammit --
          
                                    JACK
                      You swore to honor and obey --
          
                  OLDER COP                       REDNECK
          Obey me --                      Obey me, so put that Goddamn
                                          gun down.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Don't come any closer.    I'll...
                      shoot.
          
                                    WALLY
                      You ain't gonna shoot me! You
                      always needed me to protect you!
                      You for damn sure ain't got the
                      balls to --
          
            Starla BLASTS Wally, blowing open a big crater into his
            face.
          
            Wally falls to his knees.    Starla and Trevor look on in
            shock, as they see...
          
            A slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his
            face -- out of the Wally's brain.
          
            The little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers
            off quickly into the woods. Wally falls over, dead.
          
            The sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated.
          
            And then they leap at her.
          
            Starla tries to shoot them.   But she's out of ammo.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          She and Trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their
          legs can take them.
          
          
          EXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Trevor and Starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees
          rooted closely together, panicked, breathing heavy.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Bill and Kylie arrive at his police car. Bill throws the
          door open, and shoves Kylie inside. As he starts to get
          in, he turns to see the two little girls closing in.
          
          One opens her mouth and GLEEKS -- it shoots out and lands
          on the car right beside Bill's hand.
          
          The other little girl opens her mouth to GLEEK as Bill
          jumps into the driver's seat. He slams the door shut
          just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside
          him.
          
          Bill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much
          time. He goes to reload his shotgun, when he remembers.
          
                                   BILL
                    Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk.
          
          He grabs the police radio.
          
                                   BILL
                    Trevor!   Margaret!
          
          
          EXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Trevor turns and sees Jack, the Redneck, and the Older
          Cop leap powerfully over the brush behind them, coming in
          fast. But he's able to grab onto his radio.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They killed Margaret!
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          Kylie's two sisters jump onto the hood, SCREECHING.   They
          SLAM rocks on the windshield. Kylie SCREAMS.
          
                                  BILL
                          (into radio)
                    Where are you?!
          
                                                               73.
          
                                  TREVOR (O.S.)
                    We're coming your way, man!
          
          Bill JAMS the car forward, knocking the sisters off the
          hood. Then he slams on the brakes.
          
          He looks back and sees the two little girls running toward
          the car again.
          
          And he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also
          running toward the car. Kylie is SCREAMING and CRYING.
          
                                    KYLIE
                    Go!   Go!   Please!
          
          But, instead, of pulling forward on the gravel road, Bill
          turns up and onto the ranch itself -- back towards the
          running diseased.
          
                                  BILL
                    My friends are still in the forest.
          
          Bill speeds the police car over the dirt field, trying to
          avoid approaching ranchers. Some leap at the car, holding
          on and getting tossed aside. Bill zooms back toward the
          trees.
          
          Just as Bill gets a little headway on the diseased, the
          car gets stuck in some mud. The wheels spin, spraying
          mud, as the infected approach.
          
          
          INT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Starla looks back to see Jack right behind her.
          
          
          EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
          
          The infected arrive at the car. Bill just lets his foot
          off the gas, and sits there, letting the ranchers leap
          onto the car. Kylie looks at Bill, panicked by his choice
          to do nothing.
          
                                  BILL
                    We need their weight.
          
          Bill slams down the gas again, and the car zooms forward.
          The diseased get knocked off.
          
                                    BILL
                    Dumbshits.
          
          Bill rushes toward the trees of the forest.
          
                                                                74.
          
          INT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
          Starla keeps running, when she trips and falls. She looks
          down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing,
          now long fallen and curling on the forest floor. Starla
          forces herself up, as Jack closes in.
          
          Jack grabs onto her blouse, SCREECHING furiously.   When
          he HEARS something and looks over to see:
          
          Bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, directly
          toward him. Jack, frightened, lets go of Starla. He's
          about to get hit when --
          
          The police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees,
          inches from Jack.
          
          Jack smiles, and moves toward Bill -- but Starla rises
          behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed-
          wire fence.
          
          She thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front
          of Jack's neck.
          
          Jack turns to look at Starla, and topples over into the
          leaves.
          
          Bill backs the car out from between the trees. He sees
          the Older Cop and Redneck coming in toward them.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on!
          
          Trevor and Starla get into the car.   The Older Cop watches
          them back away and yells:
          
                                  OLDER COP
                    Starla!!
          
          
          EXT. ROAD AWAY FROM FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The police car pulls up and out of the forest. The car
          is in bad shape. Steam rises from the smashed grill.
          
          Bill looks to his side; he's down a bit from the
          Strutemyers' ranch. He pulls away, heading back toward
          town.
          
          The foursome sit in a stupefied daze. Starla's beside
          Bill. Trevor and Kylie are in the back. Bill grabs the
          police radio.
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby?
          
                                                                 75.
          
          Nothing. STATIC.   Everyone notes this, worried.    Bill
          tries again:
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, you there?
          
          For a moment, there's nothing.    And then:
          
                                   SHELBY (O.S.)
                    Yo, Chief.   How y'all doin'?
          
          Bill and Starla look at each other, relieved.
          
          
          INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
          
          Shelby sits at the police operator's unit, peppy.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    You dig that rat out of the hole?
          
          
          INTERCUT POLICE CAR AND STATION
          
                                  BILL
                    Listen, you got any reports of...
                    I don't know what you call 'em.
                    They look like big slugs, only
                    fast.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin'
                    about that new waitress down at
                    Sloan's! Ha ha!
          
                                   BILL
                    Shelby --
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police
                    radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
          
                                  BILL
                    Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out
                    for these things. If you see 'em,
                    keep your mouth covered. Otherwise
                    they'll go straight down it. All
                    right?
          
          Shelby looks confused, and nods.
          
                                  BILL
                    Are you nodding?
          
                                   SHELBY
                    Yeah.
          
                                                                  76.
          
                                  BILL
                    I can't hear when you're nodding.
          
                                    SHELBY
                    Sorry.
          
                                  BILL
                    We'll be there in ten minutes.
          
          Bill hangs up. Kylie is clutching onto herself, hollow-
          eyed, in deep shock. She mutters, almost unintelligibly:
          
                                  KYLIE
                    The worms are in their brains.
          
          Starla, Bill, and Trevor look at her.
          
          
          INSERT - FOREST
          
          The CAMERA TRACKS QUICKLY FORWARD, through the forest,
          and to a CLOSEUP on the Redneck, who is hunched over
          Margaret's body, eating her flesh.
          
          MATCH CUT TO a CAT SCAN of the REDNECK'S HEAD: a parasite
          is imbedded into his brain; its tail hangs down his spine,
          wagging just a bit.
          
                                  KYLIE (O.S.)
                    Drivin' 'em around...
          
          
          BACK TO THE POLICE CAR
          
          Bill stares at Kylie like she's insane.
          
                                  STARLA
                    She's right. We saw one -- one
                    came out of Wally's head.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came
                    out there --
          
                                  STARLA
                    Kylie, how do you --
          
          Kylie is rocking back and forth.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Kylie, how do you know that?
          
          Kylie shakes her head.    She doesn't want to answer.
          
                                    BILL
                    Kylie, honey.    Please.

                                                         77.
          
                                  BILL (CONT'D)
                    A lot of bad things have happened
                    to you today, we know. But we
                    need your help to find out what's
                    going on.
          
          Kylie CRIES.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    I was in the bath. It tried to go
                    inside me and I -- for a minute I
                    became it.
          
                                     BILL
                    The worm?
          
                                     KYLIE
                    I got it out.
          
                                     TREVOR
                    What are they?
          
                                     KYLIE
                    Part of him.
          
                                     BILL
                    Who?
                           (pause)
                    Who?
          
                                  KYLIE
                    Mrs. Grant's husband.
          
          Starla stares at her.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    But not always. I was -- He was...
                    other stuff too.
          
                                  STARLA
                    What other stuff?
          
          Kylie kind of points at the sky.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    He's a fucking Martian?!
          
                                  BILL
                    A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
          
          Kylie tries to think.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    For real it looks like a needle.
                    Its real face. But it always gots
                    another.
                                  (MORE)
          
                                                               78.
          
                                  KYLIE (CONT'D)
                    He goes from place to place,
                    worlds... planets... killing 'em.
                    He takes over half of what's alive
                    and eats the other half. Till
                    they're gone.
          
          They stare at her, freaked out.
          
                                     KYLIE
                    Now he's here.     He went in Mr.
                    Grant.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Through a wound on his stomach?
          
          Kylie nods.
          
                                  KYLIE
                    He took him over. His body. His --
                    his brain, everything what he knew.
                    He's only been dumb stuff before -
                    amoeba-things, and rhino-things.
                    He liked being human. Didn't want
                    to change.
          
                                  STARLA
                    And you said the worms are part of
                    him. They're all linked, like one
                    creature?
          
                                  KYLIE
                    When one sees you they all see
                    you.
          
                                  STARLA
                    An animal that doesn't procreate.
                    It spreads, grows. A living
                    disease.
          
                                   BILL
                          (to Kylie)
                    So the way to stop this thing is
                    to stop Grant?
          
          Kylie shrugs.   The police car starts CHUGGING.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shit.
          
          The car slows, and comes to a stop.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD TOWARD WHEELSY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill, Starla, Kylie, and Trevor step slowly out of the
          car. They look around the deserted road.
          
                                                                79.
          
          The wide-open night is shrouded in darkness. Quiet.
          They can see the lights of Wheelsy down the road in front
          of them.
          
          Bill speaks into the radio again, as he gets his leather
          satchel of weaponry out of the trunk. Trevor grabs ammo
          from the satchel to reload his pistol.
          
                                     BILL
                       Shelby, we broke down on 22, a
                       mile outside town. Come pick us
                       up.
          
                                     SHELBY (O.S.)
                       I got to leave my post.
          
                                      BILL
                       Do it.
          
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The foursome walks down the road, toward the city.   Starla
          and Bill are in the lead.
          
                                      BILL
                       Hey, Starla.
          
          She looks at him.
          
                                     BILL
                       Was always curious why you...
                       married Grant in the first place...
                       Just never seemed outta love.
          
                                     STARLA
                       I know what people say, Bill.
                       I... Remember, back in high school
                       I worked at my father's gas station?
          
          Bill nods.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant used to get filled up every
                       day. I knew it was just to see
                       me. He was too old -- But he was
                       handsome. And he had that big ol'
                       Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
          
                                     BILL
                       Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess
                       I would have flirted with him too.
          
          Starla smiles, thinks.
          
                                                             80.
          
                                     STARLA
                       My father, he was -- he was real
                       close to evil. People didn't know.
                       Still don't. From the time I was
                       a toddler he'd beat the hell out
                       of me. I don't mean just like a
                       smack for smart-mouthing... he
                       took a real enjoyment in it. And
                       when I turned eleven or twelve,
                       things... well, they got worse.
          
          Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
          
                                     BILL
                       When you wanted to run away, I
                       called your dad.
          
                                     STARLA
                       That wasn't a good night, no.
          
                                     BILL
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Starla shrugs it off.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I
                       fill his tank with like an eighth-
                       a-gallon as usual. And he notices
                       my lip's all swollen up, and starts
                       asking me how it happened. I don't
                       know why I chose then, why Grant --
                       I guess I saw an opportunity. And
                       I told him everything, first time
                       I told anyone. Grant was furious.
                       He picked up a tire iron, walked
                       straightaway into the garage, and
                       beat my father half to death. You
                       say it's not about love, Bill.
                       But that was the closest thing to
                       it I ever knew.
          
          Pause.
          
                                     STARLA
                       Grant asked me to marry him a few
                       weeks later. I felt... safe with
                       him.
          
          Bill nods.    Starla looks at him, smiles.
          
                                     STARLA
                       After all this shit tonight, I
                       know for sure now you regret not
                       running off with me to Hollywood!
          
                                                                 81.
          
                                    BILL
                    Hell, Starla.    I always regretted
                    that.
          
          Starla looks at him, moved.
          
          Trevor looks at Kylie, shivering and terrified.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon,
                    we'll be in town, everything'll be
                    fine.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY CITY LIMIT - NIGHT
          
          A slithering parasite squirms over a paint-chipped sign
          that reads "WELCOME TO WHEELSY, SOUTH CAROLINA, THE WHEELS
          OF THE FUTURE," featuring early-'sixties graphics of a
          utopian future.
          
          THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the road, where hundreds of
          slithering parasites squirm into the city. They divide
          off in thin lines heading toward the various homes.
          
          We MOVE UP TO a WINDOW on a SMALL HOUSE, through which we
          can see an OVERWEIGHT WOMAN in spasms with a slithering
          thing in her mouth.
          
          We PAN TO the WINDOW of the HOME NEXT DOOR, where we can
          see a FAMILY gathered around a CORPSE, feasting on his
          goopy flesh.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD TOWARD WHEELSY - NIGHT
          
                                    STARLA
                    What's that?
          
          Our foursome look up to see a Buick Century parked at a
          haphazard angle in the middle of the road. The driver's
          side door is open. The headlights are still on.
          
          They look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off
          his belt and aims it in front of him. They all slowly
          approach the car, in the darkness.
          
          Bill aims his flashlight into the Buick.   The keys are
          still there, but no one's inside.
          
          Trevor looks at the grill of the car.   It's dented.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    They musta hit a deer. Probably
                    got out to see if it's okay.
          
          Bill and the others look around.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          Bill hears a LAPPING sound behind him.   He turns, aiming
          the flashlight downward.
          
          A DISEASED DEER is lapping a thick purple tongue on the
          wound of a dead man. The sick creature is mostly hairless
          and pink and covered in veins. Bulbous black eyes hang
          on the sides of its head like a goldfish's.
          
          The diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low
          growl.
          
                                  BILL
                    Fuck me.
          
          The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's
          chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping
          his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings
          his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head
          against the hard road.
          
          Kylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at
          them from different directions. The deer SCREECH like
          dying rabbits.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Bambi-rats!
          
          Trevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He
          SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps
          his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost
          like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve
          with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting
          go of his gun.
          
          Kylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a
          rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's
          going on from there.
          
          Starla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside
          her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED
          BUCK, careening toward her.
          
          She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can.
          
          A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder
          and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him.
          Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able
          to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun
          above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being
          battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of
          his fingers barely graze the muzzle.
          
          Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the
          front seat.
          
          But the horned buck is upon her.   He bites into Starla's
          ankle. She SCREAMS.
          
                                                                 83.
          
          He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road.
          But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her
          might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power.
          
          The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him
          down the road as he HOLLERS.
          
          Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to
          scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just
          a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly
          starts to crawl out toward him.
          
          As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on
          her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able
          to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition;
          the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the
          floorboard, pressing on the gas.
          
          The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the
          horned buck's mouth.
          
          Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too
          far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the
          rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into
          Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat,
          and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him,
          knocking the beast back.
          
          The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole
          head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over,
          dead.
          
          Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs
          the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg.
          The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face
          and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the
          telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.
          
          Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.
          
          He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It
          has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill
          SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight
          on.
          
          Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running
          through the fields toward them.
          
          Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up
          alongside her friends. Throws open the passenger door.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Get in!
          
                                                                84.
          
          INT. BUICK CENTURY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill fumbles for the radio controls.
          
                                     BILL
                    Shelby!
          
          Trevor looks out the window, watching the deer fade away
          behind them.

          EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Shelby, sick and bloated, speaks into his radio, as he
          moves down the street with a hoard of the infected.
          
                                  SHELBY
                    Already on our way.
          
          
          BACK TO BUICK
          
          Kylie turns her head, and glances out the window.   And
          SCREAMS. Starla, Bill, and Trevor turn to see --
          
          An SUV barreling straight towards them.
          
          It SLAMS hard into the side of the Buick.
          
          And SMASHES the car back, across a short lot, and through
          the glass storefront of a flower store.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The Buick and SUV are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this
          store. Shattered vases and flowers surround them. Glass
          fragments dangle from the window frame. Some fall and
          CLINK to the floor.
          
                                                                   85.
          
          Starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. She looks
          beside her to see Bill and Trevor, seemingly unconscious.
          
          She looks back at Kylie. The impact has killed her. Her
          neck is bent at an ungodly angle. Bone juts up out of
          her skin.
          
          Starla looks out her rear window and sees the SUV door
          open, and the DISEASED DRIVER stumble out. His body is
          battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her.
          He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a MUMBLY
          MOAN comes out.
          
          Starla struggles to get out of the car. Eventually, she
          does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass
          from the shattered window, and the water all over the
          floor from the broken vases.
          
          She sees the moaning driver limping toward her.   He's
          still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible.
          
          The driver gets close, ready to grab her. Starla sees a
          metal bar. She grabs it. And SLAMS it into the diseased
          man's shin.
          
          He topples over.
          
          She crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal
          bar down into his head, again and again, SHOUTING and
          CRYING with fury.
          
          Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead.
          
          Starla looks up to see dozens of DISEASED TOWNSFOLK coming
          at her, from down the street, between buildings. They
          see Starla there.
          
                                  DISEASED TOWNSFOLK
                    Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!
          
          Bill and Trevor limp up behind Starla, pulling her toward
          a door on the back wall.
          
                                  BILL
                    Come on.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill closes and locks the door behind them.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all
          sides. They SCREECH.
          
                                                                 86.
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
                                  TREVOR
                    What the hell are we going to do?!
          
                                  BILL
                    Just block the doors, any way you
                    can.
          
          Bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench.
          
          Trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal
          shelving.
          
          Starla looks doubtful of this whole activity.   But still,
          she helps.
          
          The storeroom has two doors.    They start nailing anything
          over them they can.
          
          Trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a
          crack in the upper corner of the room.
          
                                  TREVOR
                    Goddamn snakes!!
          
          Trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting
          wildly at them, BLASTING up the whole room.
          
          Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from
          other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at
          them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.
          
          Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and
          Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts
          jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting
          big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk WAIL and SLAP their hands on the
          walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual.
          Some push on the doors.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill hears something POP behind him. He turns to see a
          little hole in one of the doors. Three diseased fingers
          slip inside, trying to pull away more.
          
          Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers.
          
          An arm pops through the door.    Bill slams the circular
          saw into that. Blood spurts.     Bone grinds.
          
                                                               87.
          
          A man's eye peeks through another crack. Bill jams the
          circular saw through the crack and into the man's face.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The FACE-SAWED MAN backs away from the hole, clutching
          his bleeding eye.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door
          across from him. He runs over to the space, when the
          circular saw stops turning. Bill turns to see he's
          accidentally unplugged it.
          
          
          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of
          the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing
          down one door. Some have even climbed onto the roof above
          it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead.
          
          
          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
          
          Bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his
          shotgun. Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have
          almost torn down one of the doors.
          
                                  STARLA
                    This is stupid.
          
          Starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away
          the planks they nailed there.
          
                                  BILL
                    What are you doing?!
          
                                  STARLA
                    We can't make it. Just get away,
                    when you get the chance.
          
                                   BILL
                    What?
          
                                  STARLA
                    He wants me, Bill! I'm going to
                    get him to take me to him! See if
                    you can follow me, and kill him!
          
                                   BILL
                    No, Starla!   No!
          
                                                                     88.
          
            Another full metal plate is pushed off the door. A
            DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see
            it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor
            looks down, in shock.
          
            And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The
            Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over
            him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor
            starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab
            him.
          
                                     BILL
                      Nooo!
          
            Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him
            away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid
            has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart
            like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.
          
            Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.
          
            Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door.
            She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this
            side of the building anymore. She moves outside.
          
          
            EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
          
            Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING
            and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he
            makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across
            the street.
          
            He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But
            she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground.
            Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head
            for Bill to go. Bill is confused.
          
            The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the
            sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to
            Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily
            at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in
            their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.
          
                  DISEASED WOMAN                 DISEASED KID
          Starlaaaaaaa!                  Starlaaaa!
          
            And they WAIL, in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all
            the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they
            inherited from Grant Grant, such as:
          
                                    SMASHED-FACE MAN
                      You said for better or worse! You
                      lied!
          
                  NO LONGER PRETTY                BRENDA'S HUSBAND
          I gave you everything!         I.   Loved. You!
          
                                                                      89.
          
                  SHELBY                           FAT SICK GUY
          It's not just about lesson       I wanted you by my side,
          plans! Hank Wilcox wants         sugarplum. But I'm too
          your pussy!                      ugly now, huh!!?
          
                  MR. INAPPROPRIATE                WAITRESS
          Your daddy'd still be            You always thought I was a
          fucking your every hole          joke, ain't you?
          weren't it for me!!
          
                                    BRENDA'S HUSBAND
                      You like Pardy better'n me? That's
                      who you want to screw now?!
          
                                    STARLA
                      Grant... Please...
          
            They surround her. They touch her body, her ass, her
            breasts. Pull on her clothes. She trembles.
          
                                    STARLA
                      I'm sorry... I know I haven't
                      behaved how you -- how you want.
                      I know. Don't... hurt... me.
          
            Starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her
            calf, tasting her.
          
                                    STARLA
                      We need... to... talk.
          
            A DISEASED MAN grabs the side of her neck and face.
          
                  DISEASED MAN                     BRENDA'S HUSBAND
          Then talk.                       Then talk.
          
                                    STARLA
                      Not here, though, okay? Not all
                      of you. I'm not used to -- I want
                      to talk to your face, Grant. Your
                      more real face. Your --
          
            The diseased townsfolk grab Starla, enveloping her, and
            start dragging her away.
          
            A few townsfolk remain behind.    They look around for Bill.
          
                                     SMASHED-FACE MAN
                      Pardy?!!   Where are you, Pardy!!
          
            But he's nowhere to be seen.    They SCREECH angrily.
          
          
            EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
          
            Bill runs as fast as he can across the street here -- the
            same direction the hoard took Starla, but down a block.
          
                                                                 90.
          
            EXT. SIDE OF MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
          
            Bill falls against the side of this building, hiding in a
            dark crevice. Down the way, he can see numerous dead
            bodies, and a WOMAN chased down and tackled by some
            infected townsfolk.
          
            Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him.
            Bill crouches down so he isn't seen.
          
                   DISEASED WOMAN               SHELBY
          Pardy.   Pardy. Pardy.        Come on out, Pardy.
          
                                     PASTOR
                       We've surrounded the town, you
                       prick! Ain't no way outta here!
          
            Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill
            looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard
            moving Starla across that street.
          
            He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT STREET - LATER
          
            One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls
            to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She
            stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost
            hyperventilating.
          
          
            EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
            Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop. She
            looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front
            yard. Starla gazes up at her home:
          
            The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the
            front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive
            thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been
            partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,
            the roof is caved-in and sloping.
          
            Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of
            the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.
          
          
            EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
            Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can
            see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind
            some shrubs.
          
                                                                   91.
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to
          the front door.
          
          Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house.
          It's pitch black inside. She looks back at the rotting
          faces behind her. And then slowly enters.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla balks at the smell. She looks beside her at the
          garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become
          Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some
          bodies, in a pile.
          
          Starla steps slowly forward, looking around.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here.
          
          
          EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home.
          They seem impossible to get through.
          
          Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet
          from the Grants'. He makes sure no one's paying attention
          for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked
          car. The diseased don't see him. Bill gazes down the
          street beside him.
          
          The sun is just barely beginning to rise.   They don't
          have much time to move in the darkness.
          
          Bill makes a break for the house next door.
          
          
          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Starla walks into the kitchen. Cooking supplies and
          condiments are scattered over the floor. She spots a
          meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils.
          
          She glances out the rear window. Diseased people are
          guarding the backyard, looking away from the home.
          
          She grabs the meat thermometer. She snaps the thermometer
          part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal
          spike into the seam of her skirt.
          
                                                                  92.
          
          Suddenly, Starla hears EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD, the song
          she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through
          tinny speakers.
          
          Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she
          can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Grant?   We should talk.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - NIGHT
          
          Bill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over
          at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard
          could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back
          door, but it's locked.
          
          Bill notices a window slightly open.    He starts to push
          it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY.
          
          He peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws
          the window up further, and crawls inside the home.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla stands at the base of the stairwell.    The SONG is
          louder.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Grant?
          
          She starts to ascend the stairs.     They CREAK beneath her
          feet.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the
          diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in
          the home next door, walking up the stairs.
          
          Bill runs toward the stairwell here.
          
          
          INT. GRANT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Starla looks down the hall.    Most of the walls have been
          torn away.
          
          Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome
          mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom.
          
          In front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts
          into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his
          crusty tentacles to push the back button.
          
                                                                  93.
          
          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD starts over.
          
          Starla walks toward him.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant keeps his back to her. Starla takes in the room.
          Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls:
          photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family
          parties.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Hey, Grant.
          
          Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You did some real interesting
                    decorating here.
          
          Grant watches her from the corner of his sad, purulent
          eye.
          
                                     STARLA
                    Hey.
          
          Starla walks by a window.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Look, the sun's starting to come
                    up.
          
          Starla starts to open the drapes.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
          
          Bill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom
          and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling
          the drapes away from the window. She sees Bill there.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant SCREECHES angrily at Starla. She quickly closes
          the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know
                    you wanted it dark.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with
          airplanes and sports memorabilia.
          
                                                                   94.
          
          He peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom
          window, now closed to him. He makes sure his shotgun is
          loaded.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall
          with the photos.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You like these memories, huh, Grant?
          
          Grant looks away from her.   Starla moves toward him, almost
          seductively.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You like being called Grant, don't
                    you?
          
          Grant is silent.   She gets closer.
          
                                   STARLA
                    I think you do. You really do.
                    You like being Grant. Like when
                    we danced. And when you... made
                    love to me here on the bed.
                    Remember that?
          
          Grant looks embarrassed.   Starla becomes more brazen.
          
                                  STARLA
                    I know you've been alone, Grant.
                    Almost forever. From here to there
                    to there to here, there's never
                    been another one for you.
          
          Starla almost looks as if she's about to cry, out of
          compassion for him.
          
                                  STARLA
                    Grant. Grant, I could help you.
                    Be with you the way you want.
                    See, I want to live. I've never
                    had much use for this world, not
                    really. You and I, together, we --
          
          She touches his tentacle with her fingers.   He moves it
          back, and GROWLS a little.
          
          Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again. She
          sets them on his tentacle once more. He glares at her
          distrustfully, breathing his deep, sick breath.
          
                                  STARLA
                    You don't trust me, I know. That's
                    why I brought you someone, Grant.
          
                                                                   95.
          
          Starla looks into his eyes.
          
                                 STARLA
                    It's Bill. He's in the house next
                    door. Just look.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at
          him. In fact, they're all looking up at him. Bill is
          confused.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant looks at Starla with sad eyes, perhaps touched.
          Starla smiles nervously, expectantly.
          
                                  STARLA
                    See? I brought him here for you!
                    As an offering! To prove I love
                    you more than him!
          
          Grant wraps his tentacle around Starla. Starla, though
          obviously disgusted, touches his face with her hand.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk break down the door, moving into
          the downstairs below Bill.
          
          
          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bill hears them approaching. He SHATTERS the window, and
          crawls onto a small mock-balcony outside.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla moves slowly in toward Grant, as if to kiss him.
          Grant looks, well, joyful.
          
          And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and
          JABS it into Grant's eye.
          
          Grant SCREECHES, blind and bucking.   Starla SLAMS the
          spike into his other eye.
          
          And she STABS him again, shoving the spike into his
          forehead, where it stays.
          
          Starla leaps to the window.   She throws open the drapes.
          
                                                               96.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Now, Bill!!   Kill the motherfucker!!
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          Bill raises his shotgun and BLASTS as Starla jumps away
          from the window.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          The WINDOW SHATTERS and the shot strikes Grant. He
          SCREECHES, swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the
          room in fury.
          
          One tentacle SLAMS Starla against the wall, probably
          breaking a rib or two. Another tentacle SMASHES the CD
          player, squelching the song.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          The diseased townsfolk enter the kid's bedroom, rushing
          toward Bill on the balcony. But Bill won't stop. He
          BLASTS the shotgun again.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Grant is struck in the head. He starts slithering out of
          the bedroom, feeling his way out.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          Bill is out of shells. He drops his shotgun. He grabs
          the grenade out of the pocket on the black leather bag.
          
          
          INT. GRANT BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Starla, clutching her ribs and barely able to move, pulls
          herself up on the window.
          
          Bill tosses her the grenade. She tries to catch it, but
          misses it. It lands on the carpet. She see Grant's
          tentacles slipping away. She tries to move but she's
          hurt bad, bleeding.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
          
          The diseased GLEEK at Bill, but Bill throws himself
          forward, letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade --
          
                                                                  97.
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes. He
          grabs a .38, and stands beside the window on Grant's house.
          
          Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs.
          
          Bill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass.
          
          He UNLOADS the clip into him.
          
          The diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him. Grant,
          using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward,
          wrapping it around Bill's neck, raising him up. Grant
          SCREECHES.
          
          
          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Starla appears at the top of the stairs, clutching her
          bloody side. She has the pin in one hand and the grenade
          in the other.
          
          With all her remaining effort, she lobs the grenade behind
          Grant.
          
                                     GRANT
                    Er...?
          
          It EXPLODES.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Grant's exploding flesh sends Bill flying backwards.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Starla is thrown back.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
          
          Around the house, the diseased's eyes gaze lifelessly
          upward as they each plummet to the grass.
          
                                                            FADE TO:
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING
          
          Bill unwraps what's left of the tentacle from his bruised
          neck, and looks around at the dead diseased. Grant's
          splattered flesh is around him.
          
                                                               98.
          
          Bill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him.
          And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a
          distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum. Sticking out of a
          new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore.
          It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs
          popping out.
          
          
          INT. GRANT HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke:
          most of the second floor has been blown away. Her mutated
          husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs.
          
          
          EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla comes around the side of the house, holding a paper
          towel roll to the slice on her ribs. She sees Bill
          standing there. She smiles.
          
                                   STARLA
                    Hey.
          
          Bill smiles too.
          
                                   BILL
                    Hey.
          
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
          
          Bill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather
          bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around
          them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as
          well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but
          no life remains.
          
          
          EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill finds an abandoned Nissan Maxima in the middle of
          the street, with the keys still in it.
          
                                  BILL
                    Starla, over here.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELSY EXIT - LATER
          
          In the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled
          ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant, and out
          onto --
          
                                                                  99.
          
          EXT. ROAD BEYOND WHEELSY - DAY
          
          The sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car.
          Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as
          they head up this long, barren road outside the city.
          
          
          EXT. CLUSTER OF STORES - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill and Starla pass through a small block of stores.
          
          Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual,
          HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going
          about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.
          
          Bill grabs Starla's hand.   She clenches his tightly.
          
                                  STARLA
                    We can probably get some first aid
                    and food at this gas station up
                    here.
          
                                    BILL
                    Yeah.   Good.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The Maxima pulls into the station, and stops.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Starla and Bill pile stuff up on the cashier's counter --
          Band-Aids, gauze, alcohol; Power Bars and Gatorade. The
          CASHIER rings it up, staring at them because of their
          wounds.
          
                                  CASHIER
                    Comes to 32.87.
          
          Bill pulls money out of his pants pocket. As he does,
          Starla glances down. His arm pulls up his shirt, and
          Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his
          stomach. She turns away, looking around, confused.
          
          Bill pays, smiles at the cashier.
          
                                    BILL
                    There you go.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
          
          A stunned Starla steps with Bill out of the station, moving
          toward the car.
          
                                                                100.
          
          Starla stops.
          
                                 STARLA
                    Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to
                    get aspirin.
          
          She starts to move back inside.     Bill stops her.
          
                                  BILL
                    I'll get it for you.      Ibuprofen or
                    aspirin?
          
                                     STARLA
                    Aspirin.
          
          Bill smiles, and goes back inside. Starla moves quickly
          with the bag of stuff toward the car.
          
          
          INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Bill pays for the aspirin, and walks out with it.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          Bill walks out; the Maxima is still there.
          
          
          INT. MAXIMA - DAY
          
          Bill gets in the driver's seat, puts his keys into the
          engine.
          
                                  BILL
                    We'll just head up here into
                    Bishopville, get checked up in the
                    hospital. Then maybe we'll head
                    off to Hollywood after all, huh?
          
                                     STARLA
                    Okay.
          
          Bill turns to smile at Starla. She's aiming the .38 at
          his face. Tears are streaming down her cheeks.
          
                                  BILL
                    Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my
                    best not to hurt anybody --
          
                                     STARLA
                    You took Bill.
          
                                  BILL
                    It's my nature.
          
                                                                101.
          
                                  STARLA
                    And this is mine.
          
          Starla pulls the trigger, the GUNSHOT CRACKS OUT.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          As the Maxima sits in the lot, ANOTHER GUNSHOT CRACKS
          OUT. Then we hear the HORN BLARING.
          
          
          INT. MAXIMA - DAY
          
          Bill's dead body is slumped over the steering wheel.
          Starla really can't bring herself to look at it, as she
          reaches across it and toward the door handle.
          
          
          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
          
          The car door flips open.    The horn stops blaring.
          
          And Bill's body is kicked out of the car, sliding onto
          the pavement.
          
          
          INSERT TITLE, FULL SCREEN:
          
          SLiTHER
          
          
          INT. MAXIMA - DAY
          
          Starla WIPES the tears away from her face. She glances
          out the window to see the cashier peeking out of the
          cashier's station.
          
          Starla scoots over into the driver's seat.    She shoves
          the car into drive.
          
          And she takes off down the road, not looking back.
          
          Starla's blanched and numb but the tears still keep coming.
          
                                                       CUT TO BLACK.
          
          
          
          
                                    THE END

    CLINKING GLASSES and other assorted BAR SOUNDS.

                        KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
              Let's give a hand to Rodney!

    Scattered APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER.

                        KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
              Next up, we've got a little lady
              named...KATE!

    Joyful APPLAUSE.

                        BAR VOICES (V.O.)
              Yeah, Kate!


    THE OPENING MUZAK STRAINS OF A "KARAOKE SONG TO BE
    DETERMINED"

                                                      FADE IN:


1   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                     1

    CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     *
    oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny

    KARAOKE STAGE

    in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.

    Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke
    version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent
    she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.

    At a table near the stage is --

    -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      *
    handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps
    and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --

    -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       *
    who sings along with --

    -- the small but energetic CROWD.

    Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points
    to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the
    Queen of Karaoke.

    LATER
                                                         2.


Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to
join Charlie and Owen.

                    CHARLIE
          That was so good, baby!

                       KATE
          Bullshit.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm serious. You sing like an angel
          -- a drunk angel.

Owen and Kate LAUGH.

                    KATE
          If you were writing about my
          performance for your blog, what
          would you say?

                    CHARLIE
          I'd say that, uh...my wife is the
          sexiest, most amazing woman alive.

                    KATE
          That would be such a shitty article
          -- nobody would read it.

Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at
Owen and makes a puppy dog face.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
              (to Owen)
          Aw...we need to find you a lady,
          Owen.

                    OWEN
          Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt
          with the bartender, but...I can't
          tell.

Owen motions to the --

-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's.                                *

                    KATE
          She's hot! What can't you tell?

                    OWEN
          She looks like she could kick my
          ass. No way would she go for a guy
          like me.
                                                         3.


                    KATE
          You're being a little girl -- just
          go talk to her.

                    OWEN
              (clearly shy)
          I don't know...forget about it.

                    KATE
              (not going to take "no"
               for an answer)
          I'll take point -- follow me.

Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts
her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          I want to buy a gimlet for me and a
          double-shot of whiskey for my
          brother-in-law `cause he's had a
          hard week.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
          `Kay.

The bartender quickly pours the drinks.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          That's fifteen.

                    KATE
          Wait -- don't you wanna know what
          happened to him?

The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see
if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she
listens.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
              (unenthused)
          What happened?

                    KATE
          He just got back from England --
          because he went there for a girl! A
          preppy, bitchy girl. Diane
          Court...that was her name. He loved
          her so much that he went with her
          because she had a fellowship or
          something. He gave up being a
          kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *
              (sad)
          And she dumped him.
                                                         4.


The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation
to hear her response, which is --

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
              (to Owen)
          You kickbox?

                    OWEN
              (caught in the headlights)
          Yeah.

And...that's all Owen's got.

                    KATE
              (jumping in)
          And he teaches kids at the
          kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so
          cute!

The bartender glances back to Owen.

                     OWEN
              (finally)
          A lot of `em don't have parents --
          so...it's kinda more than just a
          teacher/student thing.
              (beat)
          I know it sounds silly, but I feel
          responsible for them -- like...
              (emotional)
          ...I could be their parent.

Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.

                    KATE
              (hushed)
          I think I got him laid.

                       CHARLIE
          Yeah?

                    KATE
          She seems totally game.

                    CHARLIE
          Sure she just didn't want to get
          into your pants?

Kate rolls her eyes.

                    KATE
          I think I'm done for the night.
                                                5.


                    CHARLIE
          Yeah?

Owen wanders over, dejected.                         *

                    OWEN
          She's seen "Say Anything."

                      CHARLIE
          Eh, well...what're you gonna do,
          huh?
               (beat)
          Wanna drive us home?

                    KATE
          No -- he needs to keep working it!         *
          You guys stay here.

                     CHARLIE
          I don't want to watch my brother
          not score. I want to go to bed with
          you and...
              (whispered into Kate's
               ear)
          ...you know.

                    KATE
          I'll be home when you get there. We
          can "you know" then.

                    OWEN
              (to Charlie)
          Yeah, man -- you don't have a job
          to wake up for in the morning or
          anything.

                    CHARLIE
          Writing is a job! Not having to
          report to an office only makes work
          harder.
              (to Kate)
          Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen
          should take us home -- you're too
          drunk to drive.

                     KATE
          So's Owen.
              (suddenly focused)
          I'm not that drunk. Besides, you
          know I focus when I drive -- it
          sobers me up.

                    CHARLIE
          Tell that to the cops.
                                                             6.


    Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.

                        KATE
                  (to Charlie)
              I love you, baby. I'll be waiting
              for you in a nice warm bed. You
              have exactly one mission: get your
              brother laid -- and don't talk to
              any other women.

    Beat.

                        CHARLIE
              That sounds like two missions.

                        KATE
              No, it's just one.

                        CHARLIE
                  (to Owen)
              It kinda sounded like two, right?

                        OWEN
                  (nodding)
              It did.

    Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.

                        KATE
                  (really fast)
              GoodbyeIloveyouboth!


2   EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                        2   *

    Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances
    over and sees:

    A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS
    again.

    Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and
    Freda.

                          KATE
              You okay?

                        FREDA
                  (quick)
              Yeah. Are you?

                         KATE
                  (taken aback)
              Um...sure.
                                                             7.


                        FREDA
              Good.
                  (whispers)
              Hey, I'm not really okay.

                        KATE
              Oh...

                        FREDA
              My bitch sister just took off and
              left me here so she could hook up
              with some asshole. Now what am I
              supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a
              car here.

                        KATE
              I guess I could...

                         FREDA
              You'll give me a ride? Oh my god!
              Thank you!

    Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.                   *

                        KATE
              I was gonna say "call you a cab,"
              `cause, you know -- I don't even
              know you.

                         FREDA
              It's not far. Please? Pretty
              please...?

    Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.

                                                      CUT TO:


3   INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT                             3   *

    The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.             *

    Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances
    down at the floor and notices a FLASK.                            *

                        FREDA
              You know, you shouldn't drink and
              drive.

                        KATE
              I wasn't --

                        FREDA
              Just kidding. Can I have a sip?
                                                            8.


Kate's speechless.

                    FREDA (CONT'D)
          I'm really thirsty.

                    KATE
          It's, uh...whiskey.

                    FREDA
          Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love
          whiskey. You're the real thing,
          huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like
          me!

Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask.

                    KATE
          I don't know. No.

                    FREDA
          Can I smoke in your car?

                    KATE
              (slightly annoyed)
          Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you
          just roll down the window?

                    FREDA
          Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.

Freda takes out a --

-- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.

                    KATE
              (in disbelief)
          WHOA!

Kate immediately pulls the car over.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Not what I thought you meant.

                    FREDA
          Want a hit?

                    KATE
          No, I...is that pot?

                    FREDA
              (as though it's a
               ridiculous question)
          Of course not! What do I look like?
          A stoner?
                    (MORE)
                                                            9.

                     FREDA (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          It's crack.

                    KATE
          Oh, shit! No...no thank you.

                    FREDA
          C'mon -- it's good crack.

                    KATE
          I don't, um...I've never smoked
          crack.

                    FREDA
              (surprised)
          Really? This stuff is the truth --
          and it'll sober you up.

                    KATE
          Uh...I think you should go.

                    FREDA
          I'm not getting out in the middle
          of nowhere. Do you know what could
          happen to me all alone out here at                     *
          night?

                     KATE
          I don't know -- people might offer
          you crack?

                    FREDA
          Seriously? It's not a big deal --
          just take a little hit.

Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.

                       KATE
          I said no.

                    FREDA
          One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober
          you up.

Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of
her.

                    FREDA (CONT'D)
              (high-pitched cartoon
               voice)
          Smoke me!

Kate LAUGHS.
                                                               10.


                        KATE
              One puff. Then we are both going
              home.

    Freda nods. Long beat.

                        KATE (CONT'D)
              Fine.

    Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate
    sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.

                        FREDA
              You've got money, right?


4   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - NIGHT                                   4

    Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS --

    -- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass
    around TWO PIPES.

    LATER

    Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk.

    Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're
    still smoking crack.

                        KATE
                  (mile-a-minute fast)
              ...'cause I feel like I understand
              what it's like to be homeless, ya
              know? I mean, if you didn't know
              me, if we hadn't connected tonight,
              you might think: "There's some
              upper-middle-class, NPR listening,
              self-congratulatory, insulated,
              lazy liberal bitch. Probably never
              had to worry about anything." But
              that's not true at all! I grew up
              poor, man. Single mother.
              McDonald's used to have one day a
              week where they sold 29 cent
              hamburgers, and another day where
              they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My
              mom and me would go there and she'd
              get twenty burgers -- that was the
              limit, probably set up for folks
              just like us -- and then she'd put
              `em in the freezer and we'd
              microwave `em for dinner throughout
              the week.

                                                             11.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               I was kinda overweight until high
               school, to be perfectly honest.
               Eating used to be my thing. When I
               started drinking, though, I kinda
               stopped eating so much.
                   (back on track)
               But anyway, the point is: You and
               me, we're not so different.

     The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate. They're
     more concerned with their crack pipe.


5    EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN                               5

     Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's
     eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused,
     then jumps to her feet.


6    EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                                6

     Kate runs through the streets.


6A   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                               6A   *

     We TRACK along with Kate as she dashes past various               *
     buildings.                                                        *


6B   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - DAWN                                6B   *

     We stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS      *
     towering in the distance. From out of nowhere --                  *

     -- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards      *
     the camera.                                                       *

     A LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING:

7    INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN                              7

     Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her
     hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down
     at --

     -- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls.
                                                            12.


    She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland     *
    Park.                                                             *


8   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MORNING                         8

    Kate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small, cute house.


9   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY/KITCHEN - 9     *
    MORNING

    Kate walks into the kitchen to find --

    -- Charlie asleep at the kitchen table. CELL PHONE next to
    his head. Empty BEER BOTTLES litter the table.

    Kate tip-toes across the kitchen.

    Charlie quickly jerks up.

                        CHARLIE
                  (confused)
              Huh?!

                        KATE
              Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to
              sleep.

                        CHARLIE
              What happened? I came home and you
              were gone and I waited and waited.

                        KATE
              It's a long story.

                        CHARLIE
              I was worried. I kept calling you.

                        KATE
              I ended up...

    Charlie SNIFFS Kate.

                        CHARLIE
              You smell funny. What do you smell
              like?

                        KATE
              I fell asleep in my car. Near the
              bar. I was too drunk to drive.
                                                             13.


                         CHARLIE
               So, why didn't you come back or
               call me?

                          KATE
               Charlie --
                    (beat)
               -- I'm fine.

                         CHARLIE
               Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby.
               I love you -- and you know how you
               get sometimes.

                         KATE
               I love you too. But I'm home. It's
               over. I gotta get to work.

                         CHARLIE
               I can't be worried about you all
               the time.

     Kate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead.

                          KATE
               Don't worry so much. I'm fine.
                   (beat)
               C'mon -- let me get you to bed.

                         CHARLIE
               I'm up now -- how `bout I make us
               bacon and egg sandwiches?

     Kate smiles.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (knows he's got her)
               Magic words.


10   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING          10

     Kate takes a shower -- while she drinks a BEER.                *

     Gets dressed.

     Puts on make-up.


11   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING           11

     Kate walks into the kitchen, ready to go. Charlie is at the
     stove, cooking bacon and eggs. He hands Kate a MUG OF COFFEE
     and gestures to the table -- where there's a CHECK.
                                                              14.


                         CHARLIE
               Check for your mom's on the table.

                         KATE
               Thanks, baby.

     Kate takes a sip of coffee.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Why does the coffee taste so much
               better when you make it?

                         CHARLIE
               Because I make it with love -- and
               bacon.

     Kate LAUGHS and kisses Charlie.


12   INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                              12   *

     Kate takes a right on a STREET and then pulls into the            *

     PARKING LOT AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

     She's about to get out, but then notices...

     ...the FLASK on the floor.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Kate chugs what's left in the flask.

     ACROSS THE PARKING LOT                                            *

     MR. DAVIES -- the assistant principal, early-40's, slightly       *

     walks away through the parking lot.                               *

     Kate doesn't notice she's been seen.                              *

14   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                  14

     Kate stands next to a CHALKBOARD in front of a class of THIRD
     GRADERS. She's really animated -- doing her "game show
     hostess" schtick.

     On the chalkboard are the letters: "AN"

                         KATE
                   (to the class)
               Now, if I add a "C," what word do I
               have?

     A STUDENT raises her hand.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Yes, Hillary?                                         *

                           HILLARY                                   *
               Can?

                         KATE
               That's correct! Can. You've won an
               all-expenses paid trip to the
               blackboard, Hillary!                                  *

     Hillary hesitates. She looks embarrassed.                       *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               C'mon...there's a washer-dryer
               combo in it for you.

     Hillary shuffles up to the board and writes "CAN."              *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      *
               her a round of applause!

     The class APPLAUDS.

     Hillary smiles and goes back to her seat.                       *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Can anyone use "can" in a sentence?

     A student -- ANGELA -- raises her hand.

                           KATE (CONT'D)
               Yes?

                         ANGELA
               "Hurry up in there -- I gotta use
               the can!"
                                                        16.


The students GIGGLE.

                    KATE
              (quickly moving on)
          Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro
          with flames painted on the hood.

The students CHEER.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Now --
              (to the class)
          -- what's another word I could make
          by adding a letter to "an"?

Nobody raises their hand.

                       KATE (CONT'D)
          C'mon...

Finally, a student in the back -- RAMON -- raises his hand.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Yes -- Ramon?

                       RAMON
          P.

                    KATE
          P...okay, what word would that make
          if I added a "P"?

                       RAMON
          Um...pan?

                    KATE
          Pan! That's right. Ramon
          Martinez...COME ON DOWN!

Ramon walks up and begins to write "PAN."

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Wow! Just look at that excellent
          penman --

Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She
quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely --

-- VOMITS on the floor!

Ramon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks
horrified.

Kate glances up from behind her desk to see --
                                                                17.


     -- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like --

                         KIDS
               EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS
               LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA!
               SHRIMP! BACON!

     Embarrassed, Kate quickly gets TISSUES from her desk and
     begins cleaning up the mess.

                         KATE
                   (to the class)
               I'm so sorry you had to see that.

     HILLARY stands up.                                                *

                         HILLARY                                       *
               Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant?

                          KATE
               What?

                         HILLARY                                       *
               My mommy threw up when she was
               pregnant with my little sister. Are
               you pregnant?

     Some of the kids begin WHISPERING (saying things like "Ooh!"
     "She's gonna have a baby.").

                          RAMON
               Are you?

     Kate seems flustered and says --

                          KATE
               Yes.


15   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY            15

     Kate sits across a desk from --

     -- PRINCIPAL BARNES: female, early 50's, stern, scattered,        *
     and clearly a softy at heart, she wears a pair of GLASSES         *
     around her neck.                                                  *

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               Vice Principal Davies will be
               looking after your students for the
               rest of the day -- so you don't
               need to worry about that.
                                                        18.


                     KATE
          Oh, that's really good to know.
          I'll have to thank him.
              (beat)
          I just feel awful for getting sick
          in front of my students.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Oh, please -- they're troopers. I'm
          sure they've seen plenty worse.
              (beat)
          So -- how long have you been
          pregnant?

                    KATE
          Um...it's the first trimester.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Well, it's very exciting. You must
          be thrilled.

                       KATE
              (nods)
          Uh-huh.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Can I ask a...personal question?

                       KATE
          Okay.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          How's it...
              (beat)
          ...going for you?

                       KATE
          Huh?

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          The pregnancy, I mean.

Kate's not sure how to respond.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          Having kids wasn't in the cards for
          me. I came close, but...

Principal Barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then
catches herself and quickly shifts gears.
                                                        19.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          ...I mean, it's like I've got a
          couple hundred kids here --
              (forces a laugh)
          -- but...I don't fool myself. It's
          not the same.

                    KATE
              (considers her reply)
          Well...it's hard to explain.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Of course...

                    KATE
          I wouldn't call it a burden, but --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          It's a responsibility.

Beat.

                    KATE
          Yeah. Exactly.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (nods)
          You're so lucky.
              (beat)
          Can I...touch it?

                    KATE
          Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps
          a lot.

                       PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Of course.

                    KATE
          Like...a lot.

Principal Barnes gets up and kneels next to Kate. She places
her hand on Kate's belly and closes her eyes.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (whispers)
          Hello in there. Can you hear me?
          You're a tiny miracle. Did you know
          that? A miracle.

Principal Barnes looks up at Kate and smiles -- with tears in
her eyes.
                                                                20.


16   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                       16

     Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her
     classroom. Through the glass she sees --

     -- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned
     smile you give someone right after they've publicly
     embarrassed themselves).

     Kate mouths the words --

                          KATE
                   (silent)
               Thank you.

     -- and gestures "come here."

     Mr. Davies gestures   to the class that he'll be right back --
     before he walks out   to talk to Kate. He's got a slightly
     nervous demeanor --   somewhere between "I never became
     comfortable talking   to women" and Asperger's.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Is everything, um...okay, Mrs.
               Hannah?

                         KATE
               Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed
               -- but I feel a lot better. And I
               just wanted to say thank you.

     Mr. Davies glances down the hall.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Look -- I'm not a fool.
                   (whispered)
               I know you were drinking this
               morning.

     Kate looks shocked.

                            MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               I saw you.

                         KATE
                   (taken aback)
               Oh, no, I...

                         MR. DAVIES
               Drinking when you're pregnant is
               really dangerous.
                                                             21.


                         KATE
               I know that! Oh, God, I...
                   (long beat)
               ...listen -- I'm not actually
               pregnant.

                         MR. DAVIES
               What?

                         KATE
               I'm just really hung over. The kids
               started asking me questions after I
               vomited and I panicked.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Oh. That's...not good.

                         KATE
               I know. I...please don't say
               anything.

     Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Just...go home. Get some sleep.

     Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the
     classroom.


17   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                      17

     Kate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it
     and --

     -- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch.


18   INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - DAY                                  18   *

     Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER.
     It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not?

                         KATE
               I had such a crappy morning.

                         CHARLIE
               Me too. I spent like three hours at
               the post office trying to buy
               stamps and stuff.

     Kate takes a long sip of beer.
                                                        22.


                    KATE
          I told my class I was pregnant.

Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over
and grabs her hand.

                    CHARLIE
              (excited and sort of
               confused)
          Oh, baby, that's --

                    KATE
          I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.

                      CHARLIE
                (deflated)
          Oh.
              (beat)
          `Cause it would be great news -- if
          it was true.
              (beat)
          `Course then I'd have to drink your
          beer...

                    KATE
          Well, it was a lie. I just lied to
          my class. After barfing in front of
          them.

                    CHARLIE
              (cringes)
          Ooh...

                    KATE
          Yeah, that's what they said.
              (long beat)
          Listen...I can't do this anymore.

A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's
face.

                    CHARLIE
          What do you mean?

                    KATE
          I dunno. I think I might...drink
          too much.

Charlie LAUGHS.

                    CHARLIE
          Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.

Charlie swigs his beer.
                                      23.


          KATE
I know I do -- I'm a fucking
mess...

          CHARLIE
Baby -- that's not true. You're
beautiful. And brilliant. And I
love you. I wouldn't be married to
a "mess."

          KATE
I left work after puking in front           *
of little kids. And...now I'm               *
drinking in the middle of the day.          *

           CHARLIE
Well, those things happen
sometimes.
    (beat)
I mean, they shouldn't happen all
the time, but...it's the price of,
uh, truly living life.

          KATE
Isn't that like a slogan for some
kind of beer or toothpaste or
something...?

           CHARLIE
No. And it's true -- you and me,
we're not just some boring couple
in the suburbs who don't sleep with
each other and have nothing to talk
about except whatever TV show
they're currently into.
    (beat)
We, like...still know how to party.

           KATE
Yeah...
    (beat)
...I think I need to slow down.
    (beat)
And I might need help.

          CHARLIE
I'll help you.

          KATE
I know, but...I might need more
help.

          CHARLIE
Yeah? Like a therapist?
                                                24.


                    KATE
          I don't know -- I just get stupid
          when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a
          lot.

                    CHARLIE
          We just like to have a good time.

                     KATE
          Yeah, well...
              (beat)
          ...you've gotta promise not to tell
          this to anyone.

                     CHARLIE
              (curious)
          I promise.

                    KATE
          That includes Owen.

                       CHARLIE
          Of course.

                    KATE
          Well, last night I kinda, um...
              (hushed)
          ...smoked some crack.

                       CHARLIE
          WHAT?!

Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie.

                    KATE
          After I left the bar, I, uh, picked
          up this drunk girl and...I don't
          really remember what came next, but
          I ended up smoking crack with her.

                     CHARLIE
              (confused)
          Uh...how's that even happen?
              (beat)
          You give someone a ride and she
          rewards you with crack?!

                    KATE
          Well...she seemed desperate. She
          really needed a ride home.

                       CHARLIE
          Where?
                                                        25.


                    KATE
          Downtown. I think she maybe lives
          in...a tent?

                    CHARLIE
          What?

                    KATE
          Well...she might be homeless. Or a
          prostitute. Or just some lost
          sorority girl.
              (thinks about it)
          To be honest, I'm not sure...

                    CHARLIE
              (disgusted)
          Oh, my god...you smoked crack with
          some random stranger? Did
          you...share a pipe?

Kate doesn't answer. She doesn't need to.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Ughhh...
              (beat)
          Just playing Devil's advocate, but
          maybe it's the crack-smoking you
          need help with and not the
          drinking.

Kate gives Charlie a dirty look.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I'm just saying.

                     KATE
          The drinking led to the crack-
          smoking. The drinking leads to
          everything stupid I do.
              (beat)
          I mean...can you even remember the
          last time we had sober sex?

Charlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. He tries to
remember. And can't.

                     CHARLIE
          We'll chill out with the booze for
          a while. We can just be wine-with-                   *
          dinner people.
              (beat)
          How's that sound?
                                                             26.


19   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            19

     Kate and Charlie joyfully ride BICYCLES home from the bar.

                         CHARLIE
               Maybe you should go to, uh... one
               of those meetings. They have `em
               over there.

     Charlie gestures to a

     BUILDING (could be a church or different type of building
     where AA meets).

     Kate LAUGHS.

                         KATE
               Yeah, right.

                         CHARLIE
               Remember when I was shit-faced and
               took that Q & A pamphlet from
               there?

                         KATE
                   (laughs)
               Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to
               like every question and at the end
               it was like, "If you answered `yes'
               to any of these you're an
               alcoholic!"

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah...
                   (nostalgic)
               ...that was fun, wasn't it?

     Kate smiles and nods.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Hey --

     Charlie gestures to the street.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               -- look out for that crack!

     Kate looks down but sees nothing.

                         KATE
               What crack?
                                                             27.


                         CHARLIE
               Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a
               crack there...
                   (grins)
               ...but you must have smoked it last
               night.

     Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards
     Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away.
     Kate chases after him.


20   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER           20

     While an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which
     is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS --

     -- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and        *
     LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.

                         CHARLIE
               "Have you missed days of work or
               school because of drinking?"

                         KATE
               Absolutely.

                         CHARLIE
               "Do you envy people who can drink
               without getting into trouble?"

                         KATE
               Envy isn't exactly the right
               word...

                         CHARLIE
               "Do you have `blackouts'?"

                         KATE
               Yeah, but who doesn't?

                         CHARLIE
               "Has your drinking caused trouble
               at home?"

                         KATE
               No! We're great.

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah. Definitely. But we still had
               a lot of "yes" answers.
                   (refers to pamphlet)
               Yep...we still qualify as drunks.
                                                              28.


                         KATE
               I'm gonna go!

                         CHARLIE
                   (disbelief)
               Yeah, right.

                         KATE
               No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go.
               What time is it?

                         CHARLIE
               Eight.

     Kate gets up.

                         KATE
               See ya.

                         CHARLIE
                   (doesn't believe her)
               Uh-huh...

     Kate takes a big sip of wine.

                         KATE
                   (quite serious)
               This is me: going.

     Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it.

                         CHARLIE
               You've been boozing.

                         KATE
               So? You should come too!

     Charlie LAUGHS.

                          CHARLIE
               Yeah, right. You can't go to AA
               wasted. It's like a rule or
               something.

                         KATE
               Oh, yeah? Watch me!


21   INT. MEETING HALL - NIGHT                                  21

     An AA meeting is in progress.

     An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story.
                                                        29.


The room is filled with --

-- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their
"own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people
are adults. There are distinct groups of --

-- "PRETTY WOMEN" --

-- "OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE" --

-- "BUSINESSMEN" --

-- and "HIPSTERS."

As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a
hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his
hand.

                    DONOVAN
              (whispers)
          Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.

                    KATE
          Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!

Donovan "shushes" Kate.

                    DONOVAN
          You must be a newcomer, huh?

                       KATE
          A what?

                    DONOVAN
              (whispers)
          Um, I'm not really allowed to talk
          to new chicks, but there are lots
          of women here who can help you out.

                     KATE
              (confused)
          Okay.
              (beat)
          Do I just sit wherever?

                    DONOVAN
          The meeting already started so just
          try to find a spot anywhere.

Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying
things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a
seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.
                                                        30.


As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next
to Kate quietly try to welcome her.

                    LILY                                        *
          Are you new?

                    KATE
          To this? Yeah. Why's everyone
          whispering?

                    SHANA                                       *
          It's hard, huh?

                     KATE
          I guess.

                    LILY                                        *
          Everything's going to be fine.
          You're home.

Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear
anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally
joined Jim Jones' church.

LATER

The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE.

The tattooed man stands at the podium.

                    TATTOO MAN
          Not to embarrass anyone, but so
          that we may get to know you better -
          - is there anybody here in their
          first thirty days of recovery?

Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and
introduce themselves as alcoholics.

Kate stands up.

                    KATE
          I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a
          little drunk right now.

People burst into LAUGHTER.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Do you want me to talk about my
          childhood or something?
                                                        31.


                    TATTOO MAN
              (painfully polite)
          You know, Kate, we actually ask
          that you don't share if you've had                  *
          a drink or any mind-altering
          substance in the past 24 hours.

                    KATE
              (not listening)
          I can -- I kinda hate my dad and
          don't talk to him. And my mom...oh,
          man...I don't even know where to
          start. She's, like, stuck in the
          80's and kind of a metalhead. Her
          last boyfriend called himself a
          drummer but really just gave drum
          lessons to little kids and --

                    TATTOO MAN
              (tries to shut Kate up)
          Welcome, Kate.
              (forces a smile)
          It gets better.

                    KATE
              (not picking up the hint)
          I like drinking is the thing. I
          mean, I don't want to say you guys
          are wrong or anything...

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.

                    TATTOO MAN
          Thank you -- we're all here to
          help. We do have to move on,
          though.

The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down.

                    LILY                                      *
          Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be
          plenty of time to tell your story.

A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.

                    AMBER
          Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't
          really believe that it's been five
          years. I mean, my life was a mess
          back then. Now I'm back in school,
          I have an amazing man, I love my
          parents -- it's crazy...
                                                        32.


                    KATE
              (way too loud)
          How old is that girl?! Can she even
          go to bars?
              (to Amber)
          How old are you, Amber?

                    SHANA                                      *
          Be respectful.

Kate seems surprised at being chastised.

                    AMBER
              (gaining intensity)
          Um...okay? It's because I did the
          work. I got down on my knees and
          prayed every night! I went to a
          meeting everyday!

                      KATE
          Everyday?

                    AMBER
          It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say,
          I owe everything to AA. Well, AA --
          and God, of course!

The whole room APPLAUDS.

LATER

Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY
PRAYER.

                    EVERYONE
          God grant me the serenity to accept
          the things I cannot change --
          courage to change the things I can -
          - and wisdom to know the
          difference.

                      KATE
          AMEN!

Everyone turns and looks at Kate.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
              (embarrassed)
          Okay...I think I'm good.

Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived.
                                                             33.


22   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT               22

     Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.

                         KATE
               So much for that.

     Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-
     crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN
     FURNITURE.

     They drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      *

                         CHARLIE
               Was it a bunch of old biker guys?

                         KATE
               No, it was...I don't know.
               Enthusiastic people. A lot of
               really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!

                         CHARLIE
               Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm
               sorry it wasn't cool.

     Charlie thinks for a moment.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I can't really imagine never
               drinking. I guess I don't have to,
               though --
                   (beat)
               -- you're the one with the problem.

     Kate nods in agreement.                                           *

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Hey -- I love you. I don't want you
               to have to drink.

                          KATE
               I don't have to drink.
                   (beat)
               I just really like to drink.                            *

                         CHARLIE
                   (sincere)
               Good -- `cause you're my favorite
               person to drink with in the whole
               damn world.

     Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment,
     and then Kate...
                                                             34.


     ...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate
     grins mischievously.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Oh, no you didn't!

     Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie
     dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in
     the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too
     intense.


23   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                23

     Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to
     unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's
     extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and
     voice).

                         CHARLIE
               Are you trying to have some sex?

     Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She
     climbs on top of him and --

     -- they start having sloppy, drunk sex.

     After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving.
     She looks down to discover that --

     -- he's passed out.

     Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her
     unconscious husband.


24   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                24

     Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she
     drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more
     booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a
     couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there
     isn't more alcohol in the house.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --


25   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                          25

     Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her
     robe and slippers).
                                                                35.


26   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT                               26

     Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is
     kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO
     BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf.

     Kate sets the bottles on the counter.                             *

     The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate
     with pity.

                         CLERK
               You know I can't sell you this,
               Kate.

     An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at
     Kate.                                                             *

                         KATE
               What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come
               on -- I'm in here all the time. You
               know me.

                         CLERK
               Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're
               old enough -- but it's too late.

     The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45).

                         KATE
               C'mon -- we can just pretend it's
               before two...

     Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch.

                         CLERK
                   (not amused)
               Stop it.

                         KATE
               It's just a little wine. I'm not
               driving or anything.

                         CLERK
               I don't think so. Sorry.

     Kate gives him a big, flirty smile.

                         KATE
               Come on, dude -- I'll let you have
               a sip if you want.

     Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance.
                                                        36.


                    CLERK
          It's the law. I can't sell alcohol
          after 2 a.m. You know that.

                    KATE
          Why don't you give it to me, then?
          That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift
          -- because we're friends.

                    CLERK
          I could lose my job.

Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at
the Elderly Man in the frozen food section.                   *

                    KATE
              (to the elderly man; meant
               to be a whisper, but way
               too loud)
          You distract him, okay?!

The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of
it.

                    CLERK
          Look -- why don't you get a bottle
          of water or a coffee or something
          instead?

                    KATE
          Water or coffee? Fuck you. What --
          just cause I won't suck your dick?

                    CLERK
              (had enough)
          Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you
          gotta go.

Kate doesn't budge.

                    CLERK (CONT'D)
          Seriously, Kate. You should go.

                    KATE
          Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with
tears.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          This is bullshit!
              (beat)
          I have to pee.
                                                             37.


     Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door -
     - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down
     and begins to pull up her robe.

                         CLERK
               What the fuck are you doing?!

                         KATE
                   (caught)
               I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just
               have to pee really, really bad.                         *

                         CLERK
                   (frustrated)
               Get outta here NOW!

                         KATE
                   (pleads)
               C'mon...can't we drink together?

     The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned,
     and then...

     ...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.


27   EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN                                       27

     Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles
     River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her.

     Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.

     A bird SQUAWKS.

     Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state
     she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.


28   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING              28

     Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the
     sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and
     realizes that --

     -- it's 7:30.

     She jumps out of bed in a panic.

                          KATE
               Charlie!

     Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down
     at the bed, which is --
                                                        38.


-- COMPLETELY SOAKED.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
              (mumbled)
          Not again.

Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of
the bed.

                    CHARLIE
          Come back to bed, baby.

                    KATE
          I have to go to work. You snoozed
          my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.

                    CHARLIE
          Well, you peed on me so I guess                     *
          we're even.                                         *

                    KATE
          I have a weak bladder.

                    CHARLIE
          Well...I can't go to work like
          this.

                    KATE
          You work from our kitchen.

                     CHARLIE
          Yeah, but changing the sheets is my
          real job.
              (beat)
          Hey -- where were you last night?

                    KATE
          Huh?

                     CHARLIE
          I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you
          were gone.

                    KATE
          Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone?
          You must've been dreaming.

Kate then glances down and notices --

-- that HER FEET ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND GRASS.

She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready.
                                                             39.


29   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - STALL - DAY           29

     Kate's on her knees, puking into a toilet.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Kate exits the stall to find --

     -- Principal Barnes standing by the door.

                           KATE
               I...

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               I can only imagine the chemistry
               experiment that's going on --

     Barnes points at Kate's stomach.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
                   (smiles)
               -- in there.


30   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                  30

     Kate sits on a SMALL CHAIR reading a CHILDREN'S BOOK to her
     class --

     -- who're sitting Indian style in a semi-circle.

                         RAMON
               Are you gonna have a boy or a girl?

                         KATE
               I don't know yet.

                         HILLARY                                    *
               When will you know?

                         KATE
               Not until summertime. You guys will
               be on vacation.

                         RAMON
               If you have a boy what will you
               name him?

                         KATE
               Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?

                         ANGELA
               That's a name for a man -- not a
               baby!
                                                          40.


     The children LAUGH.

     Kate LAUGHS too -- but looks a little freaked out.


31   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY        31

     Kate eats her PACKED LUNCH with Mr. Davies.

                         KATE
               Thanks again for covering for me.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I can't promise to cover for you
               every time you get pregnant.

                         KATE
               There won't be another time.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I genuinely hope not. Look -- I
               didn't tell Barnes, but if anything
               like this happens again I'll have
               to.

     Mr. Davies smiles -- a sweet, genuine smile.

                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               Okay...Kate?

                         KATE
                   (nodding)
               Okay...
                   (not sure what to say)
               ...David?

     Beat.

                           MR. DAVIES
               Dave.

     Kate tries to hold back a smile.

                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               I know -- Dave Davies...yup...hah-
               hah. Anyway, uh, is everything okay
               with you?

                          KATE
               I don't know.
                   (beat)
               Um...no?
                          (MORE)
                                                           41.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I puked in front of my class and
          then told everyone I'm pregnant.
          That's not really okay, huh?

                    MR. DAVIES
          No, I don't think so.

                    KATE
          I went to AA last night.

                    MR. DAVIES
              (slightly uncomfortable)
          Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it?

                    KATE
          It was awful. I kept getting
          shushed.

                    MR. DAVIES
          I don't normally tell people I work
          with this... but --

Mr. Davies takes a COIN that says "Nine Years" out of his
pocket and shows it to Kate.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          -- I'm a bit of an expert when it
          comes to these things.

                       KATE
                 (shocked)
          You?

                     MR. DAVIES
          Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one.                    *
          I'm nine years sober, AA and NA.
              (beat)
          I used to drink cocaine.
              (off Kate's shocked
               expression)
          It's really cheap in the
          Philippines.

Mr. Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying.

                     MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          Listen, Kate. I know meetings can
          be weird. Especially at first, but
          if you want to...you never need to
          feel like you have to...but the
          ones I go to are pretty small. Nice
          little groups.
              (beat)
          I'd be happy to take you.
                                                        42.


                    KATE
          Maybe that would be good...I don't
          know.

                    MR. DAVIES
          No pressure, okay. That shit saved
          my life, though.

Principal Barnes walks in.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
              (switching gears)
          Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms.
          Carol's art class. They're making
          macaroni art, so...I'm pretty
          stoked.

Mr. Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as
he exits.

Principal Barnes watches Mr. Davies leave, a puzzled
expression on her face.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (to Kate)
          Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something
          for you...

Principal Barnes opens the MINI FRIDGE to reveal a huge jug
of ORANGE JUICE.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          Folic Acid! You need it now like
          never before.

                       KATE
              (beat)
          Thanks.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I bet your mother is over the moon,
          huh? Probably planning you a baby
          shower...?

                    KATE
          Oh, well...she and I aren't that
          close.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any
          motherly thing you need -- I'm                       *
          here, okay?

Barnes hands Kate a large glass of juice.
                                                             43.


                         PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
               Now drink up -- that baby in
               there's thirsty!

                          KATE
               Okay.
                   (takes a sip of orange
                     juice)
               And...you're kinda the only person
               at school -- besides Mr. Davies --
               who knows I'm pregnant. Could
               you...?

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               My lips are --

     Principal Barnes mimes "zipping" her lips.


32   EXT./INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY
                                                               32   *

     Kate walks in the front door to see    --                      *

     -- Charlie working on his computer. A BEER next to him. An
     old record PLAYS on the record player.

                         KATE
               Hey...

                         CHARLIE
               Howdy.

     Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him.

                         KATE
               How was your day? And what's that
               smell?

                         CHARLIE
               Eh -- alright. Couldn't find
               oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.

                         KATE
                   (cringes)
               Charlie! You need to eat.

                          CHARLIE
               What? It's tasty.
                   (beat)
               So...I'm going to see that band                      *
               from Iceland with the triplets play                  *
               tonight. Want to come with me and
               Owen to check it out?
                                                44.


                    KATE
          Oh, that sounds fun, but...

                    CHARLIE
          C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls
          without you.

                    KATE
          I don't know...this guy I work with
          -- Mr. Davies --

                    CHARLIE
          The Vice Principal?

                    KATE
          Yeah -- turns out he's sober and
          invited me to a meeting.

                    CHARLIE
              (surprised)
          Wow, that's...uh, cool.

Charlie goes silent.

                       KATE
          What?

                    CHARLIE
          Nothing -- I just...I didn't think
          you really loved the meeting you
          went to yesterday. In fact, it
          sounded like you hated it. So I'm
          kinda surprised you're going back.

                    KATE
          Well...this is a smaller meeting.
          It might be different. I dunno -- I
          think I want to give it a fair
          shot.

Charlie nods.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          Besides -- I was hammered last
          night.
              (beat)
          Go on and have fun out drinking
          with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm
          just gonna, you know, try something         *
          different...

Charlie pulls Kate close to him.
                                                               45.


                         CHARLIE
               I'm here for you, okay? Even though
               I drink -- I could slow down if you
               need me to.
                   (forces a smile)
               I'm sure I could.


33   EXT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                       33

     Kate approaches a small church.

     Mr. Davies waits outside.


35   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
                                                               35

     Mr. Davies walks Kate into a medium sized room where --

     -- about TEN PEOPLE are getting coffee, talking, and setting
     CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE.

     Kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're
     very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting
     --

     -- several BLUE COLLAR MEN --

     -- JENNY: 40-ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of        *
     tough demeanor --

     -- a few OLDER PEOPLE, and a YOUNG COUPLE.

     Mr. Davies directs Kate over to a table with COFFEE and
     COOKIES.

                         MR. DAVIES
               This is a little more my speed. No
               one here is the slightest bit hip.

                         KATE
               Does everybody just...kinda, you
               know -- talk here?

                         MR. DAVIES
               Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells
               their story. And then everyone else
               shares -- talks.

                         KATE
               So since you're taking me here does
               that make you my sponsor?
                                                         46.


                      MR. DAVIES
            No -- I don't think I could do                     *
            that.
                (off Kate's expression)
            `Cause, um...
                (nervously searches)
            ...well, it could get weird. But                   *
            I'll help you find one if you want.
                (gestures to the seats)
            We should sit down.

Kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats.

                      KATE
                (takes a deep breath; to
                 Mr. Davies)
            I can't believe I'm really here.

                      MR. DAVIES
            It gets better. Weirder, maybe --
            but better.

LATER

The meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of
chairs.

Jenny is midway through her speech.                            *

                       JENNY                                   *
            ...all I knew about taking care of
            myself was fucking people over and
            lying to get by. I had no idea how
            to even look for a normal job or
            pay my bills on time -- or pay my
            fucking bills at all.
                (beat)
            Now I pay my bills online.

The group CHUCKLES.

                      JENNY (CONT'D)                           *
            And I found a love in cooking. I've                *
            got my own catering business now.                  *
            And...maybe I just replaced alcohol
            with chocolate chips and
            cigarettes, but still...it's been
            years since I woke up in a park --
            in a different state.

LAUGHTER.

Kate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers --
                                                        47.


                       KATE
             I kinda like her.

                       MR. DAVIES
             Sponsor potential?

Kate nods.

                       MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
             Get her number at break.

                       KATE
             I feel like you're my wingman.

Kate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away.

LATER

An older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces.

                       ARLO                                    *
             Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a
             ten minute break. Smoke em' if you
             got em.

As some of the PEOPLE go outside --

-- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee.    *

                       KATE
             Hey, I liked your speech.

                        JENNY                                  *
             Thanks. All that dumb shit happened
             so I'm glad that now it's at least
             entertaining.
                 (beat)
             What's your name?

                       KATE
             Kate. This is my first meeting.
             Or... first meeting where I'm not
             wasted.

Jenny LAUGHS.                                                  *

                       JENNY                                   *
             Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some
             of that.

                       KATE
             I don't really know how this stuff
             works.
                       (MORE)
                                                        48.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          But...could I get your number? I
          mean, I may not need it, but...

                    JENNY                                     *
          Yeah, of course. I can help explain
          it to you -- and also, we can just
          talk.

                     KATE
          Okay. Yeah.
              (beat)
          You've been sober since you were
          24?

Jenny nods.                                                   *

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          That seems really young.

                     JENNY                                    *
          I didn't have much of a choice -- I
          crashed my car into a nursing home.
              (beat)
          I think the break is just about
          over. This meeting is the kind
          where everyone can share. Sharing
          always helps me, so...if it's not
          too weird -- try introducing
          yourself and telling the group
          what's going on.

LATER

Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next   *
to Kate is finishing up.

                    TINA                                      *
          ...anyway, that's where I'm at
          today. Thanks for listening.

Everyone looks at Kate.

                    KATE
          Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and...
              (long beat)
          ...I'm an alcoholic?

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

                      GROUP
          Hi, Kate.
                                                                49.


                          KATE
               Sorry. I don't mean to laugh --
               it's just saying those words...
                   (beat)
               ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I
               don't really know. I drink -- a
               lot. I've always drank. Everyone I
               know drinks a lot. I never really
               thought I had a problem -- lately
               though it seems like maybe I do. I
               just want to be able to drink a
               beer without it turning into twenty
               -- or wetting my bed.
                   (beat)
               It seems like every time I drink
               something awful happens. All the
               shit that I used to laugh off isn't
               really funny anymore. The dumb
               drunk stuff has gone from
               embarrassing to scary.
                   (beat)
               I'm kinda...scared.

     Kate stops. Looks around self-consciously.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

     A SERIES OF short, quick scenes:


35   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      35

     Kate sits at her desk grading papers. Kate's hand has an
     uncontrollable tremble as she tries to carefully make red
     checks on students' papers. Self-consciously, she steadies         *
     her right hand with her left.

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

37   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                          37

     Kate is at a meeting -- talking to Jenny.                           *

38   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT                 38

     While Kate and Charlie eat dinner, Kate drinks WATER but
     focuses on Charlie's glass of WINE and the slow, careful sips
     he takes.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

39   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              39

     Charlie and Owen play video games and LAUGH while Kate tries
     to concentrate on a book -- but is clearly distracted by how
     loud the guys are.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

     Charlie sleeps on the other side of the bed as Kate writes in

     sleeps.

     Kate rides her bicycle hard. It might even be...exercise?

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

                         MR. DAVIES (V.O.)
               How about ninety days?

                                                         FADE IN:
                                                                51.


42   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                        42

     EVERYONE is dressed differently, some people have different
     hair-cuts, etc.

     Mr. Davies stands up, holding a PLASTIC CASE.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Is there anyone here who has ninety
               days of continuous sobriety?

     Kate stands up -- she looks way more "together" than she did
     earlier. She gives Mr. Davies a hug -- and he hands her a "90
     DAY CHIP."

                         KATE
               I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.

     Everyone CLAPS.

                           EVERYONE
               Hi, Kate.

     Kate sits down next to Jenny and gives her a hug.                 *

                         JENNY                                         *
                   (whispered)
               Congratulations.


43   EXT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT                       43   *

     Kate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with          *
     Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.              *

                         JENNY                                         *
               I'm really proud of you, Kate.

                          KATE
               I kinda can't believe it's been
               ninety days.
                   (beat)
               The longest I've gone since high
               school without drinking was, like,
               a week.

                         MR. DAVIES
               My first three months were such
               hell. I think I'm only sober today
               because I just never want to go
               through that again.
                                                52.


                    KATE
          It's weird -- in after-school
          specials the getting-sober part was
          only like a minute of the movie and
          suddenly...daddy's all okay.

Several people LAUGH.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          But it's so fucking hard and weird
          and suddenly I have all these other
          problems now that drinking isn't
          the problem.

                       JENNY                          *
          Like what?                                  *

                    KATE
          Everything else. Work, my non-
          existent relationship with my
          mom...

                    JENNY                             *
          When was the last time you saw her?

                    KATE
              (tries to remember)
          A year, at least.

                    JENNY                             *
          Well...maybe it's time.

                     KATE
          Maybe.
              (beat)
          And then there's my marriage. I
          mean, Charlie's great. Really
          great, he's supportive, especially
          at first. It's strange, though. I
          feel like alcohol was the thing
          that connected us and now that I
          don't drink we lead these two very
          different lives.
              (beat)
          We haven't slept together in
          forever...
              (laughs)
          I haven't pissed myself in awhile,
          though. So that's good.

                    JENNY                             *
          It takes time.

Kate gives an exasperated look.
                                                     53.


                          JENNY (CONT'D)                    *
                   (half-stern cheerleader
                    tone)
               Keep working the steps.
                   (glances at her watch)
               Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I
               should actually run you home now
               and come back. I need to start
               locking up.

                         KATE
               I could stick around and help
               you...

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (to Kate)
               I could take you home.
                   (off Kate's reaction)
               If you want.


44   INT./EXT. MR. DAVIES' CAR - NIGHT                 44   *

     Mr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house.

                         MR. DAVIES
               My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink --
               well, not like us, but as soon as I
               got sober I started to change and
               she just...didn't.

                         KATE
               I didn't know you were married.

     Beat.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Yeah, I was married once --
                   (laughs)
               -- in my other life. But I
               shouldn't be talking to you about
               this stuff.

                         KATE
               Why?

                         MR. DAVIES
               I don't know...

                         KATE
               Because you're a dude we can't
               talk? I don't get that "men stick
               with men, women stick with women"
               stuff.
                                                54.


                    MR. DAVIES
          Well, if you were sitting where I'm
          sitting you'd understand.

                    KATE
          Are you trying to tell me that you
          have a crush on me?

                    MR. DAVIES
          What am I, one of your students?            *
          Crush?

                    KATE
          Yeah, crush.

                     MR. DAVIES
              (long beat)
          I kind of do, yes. I have a crush
          on you. I know that's wrong --
          you're newly sober and married and
          I shouldn't be thinking about you
          like that. But yeah, I should put
          that out on the table.
              (beat)
          Honesty.

                    KATE
          It's okay. I think you're a really
          good guy.

                    MR. DAVIES
          Oh, great -- good guys are the
          nerds that carry the pretty girls'
          books.

                    KATE
          Oh, c'mon...

                    MR. DAVIES
          I think you're beautiful.

Kate smiles bashfully.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          And smart, and sexy, and cool...

Mr. Davies moves slightly closer to Kate.

                    MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
          And I know it's wrong, but -- in
          meetings I stare at your lips and
          your legs and all I can think about
          is fucking your moist pussy.
                                                             55.


     Kate jumps back, aghast.

                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
                   (off Kate's horrified
                    expression)
               Oh, crap! I don't know why I just
               said that. I'm really, really
               sorry.

                         KATE
               WHAT THE FUCK?

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (genuinely sorry)
               Oh, that was a bad thing to say,
               right?

                           KATE
               YES.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I'm so, so sorry. I'm just
               confused, and I don't know how to
               talk to women --

                          KATE
               Jesus -- you can't just go around
               telling people you want to fuck
               their "moist pussy."
                   (beat)
               Who even says that?

                         MR. DAVIES
               I'm really sorry.

     Kate gets out of the car, slams the door shut, then leans in
     to say --

                          KATE
               I have to go inside my house --
               where I live with my husband.
                   (beat)
               Thanks for your creepy version of
               honesty.


45   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT             45

     Kate lies in bed and appears slightly bored as --

     -- Charlie is under the covers, going down on Kate.

                           KATE
               You okay?
                                                        56.


                    CHARLIE
              (from under the covers)
          Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The
          tortoise wins the race.

                    KATE
          Actually, I'm not really in the
          mood.

                    CHARLIE                                   *
          But I wanted to give you a 90 days
          gift.

                    KATE
          It's okay -- the 90 days was the
          gift.

                    CHARLIE
          Sorry if I was doing a bad job --
          I'm kinda hammered.

                    KATE
          It's alright. Charlie...
              (long beat)
          ...I miss you.

                    CHARLIE
          Huh?                                                *

Charlie comes up from under the covers -- and looks a bit     *
tipsy.                                                        *

                    KATE
          I mean...I don't know. I don't
          really feel connected to you
          anymore.

                    CHARLIE
          Did I do something?

                    KATE
          No.
              (beat)
          We don't talk that much.

                    CHARLIE
          We used to talk, but now you come
          home and go to meetings and by the
          time you get back I'm --

                    KATE
          Kinda drunk.
                                                   57.


                       CHARLIE
             I was gonna say "tired."

Silence.

                       KATE
             There's some stuff I need to do
             this weekend. I think I'm gonna go
             up to Lake Arrowhead.

                       CHARLIE
             Really? To see your mom?

Kate nods.

                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
             Why?

                       KATE
                 (defensive)
             Do I need a reason?

                        CHARLIE
             With your mom? Kinda.
                 (beat)
             Is this the "amends" step?

                       KATE
             No.

                       CHARLIE
             Well then why're you going?

                        KATE
                 (beat)
             We send her checks. But we never
             actually see her. Sometimes it
             feels like I'm paying her to not be
             in my life. I thought it would be
             nice to visit her.
                 (beat)
             And Jenny thinks it would be a good         *
             idea.

Charlie LAUGHS.

                       KATE (CONT'D)
             What?

                       CHARLIE
             I don't know...I mean, do you do
             everything your sponsor tells you
             to do?
                                                        58.


                          KATE
               No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or
               something?

                          CHARLIE
               I dunno...it's been a long damn
               time since you've seen your mom.
                   (beat)
               And you didn't listen when I
               suggested we visit her.

                          KATE
                   (suddenly gets that it's
                    an ego thing for Charlie)
               Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This
               just...it felt like the right time.
                   (beat)
               With all the changes I'm going
               through.

                         CHARLIE
               Well, can I come with you? It'll be
               like a little vacation.

                         KATE
               Um...I think I should go alone.

                         CHARLIE
               Come on, if you do that you'll just
               get depressed. If I go we can try
               to make it fun. Go hiking and
               stuff.

                          KATE
               Well, if you go, don't take this
               the wrong way but -- I'd like it if
               maybe you didn't drink.
                   (beat)
               Just while we're there.

                         CHARLIE
                   (smiles)
               I think I can handle not drinking
               for like a day.

     Kate smiles and snuggles up into Charlie's arms.

                                                                48

      Kate and Charlie are parked in front of a --

      -- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin
      look. There's some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as
      well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES.

                          CHARLIE
                Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed
                those guys.

      Kate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    (waving to a lawn-gnome)
                Hi, Holger!

      Kate LAUGHS. Long beat.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                So...we gonna go in?

      Charlie glances at Kate and reads the anxiety on her face.


49    EXT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - DAY                              49

      Kate and Charlie walk to the front door.

                          KATE
                    (unsettled)
                I should've brought something.

                          CHARLIE
                You're fine.

                          KATE
                Something, you know? Flowers, or...

                          CHARLIE
                Wine?

                          KATE
                No. Definitely not that.

      They get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like
      she'd be okay if they ran back to the car.
                                                        60.


                    KATE (CONT'D)
              (conceding)
          Go on...

Charlie KNOCKS.

                      FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          S'minute!

                     KATE
              (under her breath)
          Oh, God...

The door opens, revealing --

-- ROCHELLE: late-50's, wears an old shredded heavy metal
band T-shirt and tight ripped-up jeans, looks like she enjoys
an afternoon drink or three.

                    ROCHELLE
              (surprised)
          Katie!

Rochelle wraps her arms around Kate.

                    ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
          What're you doing here?

                    KATE
          I left you a message, mom.

                    ROCHELLE
          Oh, you know I don't check that
          thing.
              (notices Charlie; slightly
               flirty)
          Hello there, young man.

                    CHARLIE
          Hi, Ms. Foster.

                     ROCHELLE
          Well, then...
              (beat)
          ...what a lovely surprise -- you
          two came to visit. Hell has frozen
          over.
              (laughs)
          Just kidding. Come inside -- let me
          fix you both some drinks.

                    KATE
          Just water for me.
                                                             61.


     Rochelle LAUGHS as she leads the way. Kate glances at Charlie
     -- she already seems slightly annoyed.


50   INT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY             50

     Kate and Charlie sit down.

     The place is a MESS. Magazines and junkmail everywhere. Too
     much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner. The walls
     are covered with framed HEAVY METAL BAND POSTERS -- and there
     are ASHTRAYS everywhere, filled to the brim with cigarette
     butts.

                         ROCHELLE (O.S.)
               ...you wouldn't believe how much
               the neighborhood's changed! After
               Mr. Baker passed away and the kids
               put Mrs. Baker in a home, the
               people that moved in, oof!

     Rochelle walks in holding a tray with THREE GIN AND TONICS.

                         ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
               It's like they don't even
               understand the concept of birth
               control in their country!

     Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts
     a drink on the table in front of her.

                          ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
                   (confides)
               If you ask me, I think it's a meth
               house.
                   (beat)
               They've always got those little
               five year old twins "playing" in
               the yard, but I'm pretty sure
               they're the lookouts.

                         KATE
               That's pretty wild, mom.

                         ROCHELLE
               Right?
                   (notices that Kate hasn't
                    touched her drink)
               What's wrong, honey? Think I forgot
               how to mix `em?

                         KATE
               I told you I just wanted water.
                                                           62.


                    ROCHELLE
          Oh, please! Where I'm from, "no"
          means "yes."
              (to Charlie)
          Am I right or am I right?

                     CHARLIE
              (forcing it)
          Huh-huh...

                     KATE
          That's actually why I wanted to
          come up, mom.
              (beat)
          I stopped drinking.

Rochelle LAUGHS -- then realizes Kate and Charlie aren't
joking.

                     ROCHELLE
              (quickly serious)
          Are you telling me I'm going to be
          a grandma?

Rochelle tears up with joy.

                    ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
          Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna
          be a grandma!
              (to Charlie)
          And you know that "no drinking when
          you're pregnant" thing is just a
          myth. I drank plenty when I was
          pregnant with Kate -- and look how
          she turned out!

Beat.

                    KATE
          I'm not pregnant, mom.

                    ROCHELLE
          Oh.

                    KATE
          I just needed a break. I'm sober
          for the first time in years.

                    ROCHELLE
          Well...
              (dismissive)
          ...we'll see how long that lasts.
                                                63.


                    KATE
          It's been a while, actually.

                    CHARLIE
              (chimes in)
          90 days.

                     ROCHELLE
              (to Kate)
          You've sure picked the right
          partner --
              (gestures to Charlie)
          -- for this little mission.

                    CHARLIE
              (defensive)
          Hey -- I'm not drinking
          either...today.

                     KATE
              (to Charlie; slightly
               annoyed)
          Drink if you want to, Charlie.
              (to Rochelle)
          Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm
          doing it by myself.
              (beat)
          And...I started going to 12-step
          meetings.

Rochelle looks slightly disgusted.

                     ROCHELLE
          Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous.
              (to Charlie)
          Katie's father went to those
          meetings a few years after we got
          married. Dried up. Left me. You can
          see how well that worked out for
          me...
              (Rochelle gestures to her
                living room)
          ...I raised his daughter in this
          PALACE while he's somewhere in
          Florida with his shiny new wife and
          kids.
              (beat)
          Bastard.
              (long beat; to Charlie)
          You better be careful -- they
          change.

Kate and Charlie exchange a glance.
                                                               64.


                         KATE
               I thought you'd be happy for me,
               mom.

                         ROCHELLE
               Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a
               good hostess, am I?

     Rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs
     it.

                         ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
               I'll microwave you your favorite.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Charlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a REALITY TV SHOW -- while
     eating...

     ...MCDONALDS CHEESEBURGERS.                                      *

     Rochelle rests her head on Kate's shoulder.

                         ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch.

                         KATE
               It's okay, mom. I know you can't
               help it.


51   EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTA'S VILLAGE - DAY                 51

     Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village --

     -- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant
     ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the
     middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time.
     Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film.

     Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around.

                         KATE
               This place shut down a decade ago
               and then there was a fire and now
               it's basically abandoned.

     Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the
     place.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               We came here every year the week
               before Christmas.
                         (MORE)
                                                        65.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          And then I worked here in high
          school -- selling hot chocolate.
          And they had real reindeer, too.
          They kept `em over there.

Kate points at the remains of a PEN.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          My mom worked here when she was
          younger. I think everyone who grew                  *
          up around here worked at Santa's
          Village at some point.

Charlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          This is what I think of when I
          think of Christmas.
              (long beat)
          Thanks for coming up here with me.

                       CHARLIE
          Of course.

                    KATE
          I'm sorry my mom's so awful.

                    CHARLIE
              (shrugs)
          She just can't handle her liquor.

Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a
moment. And then Charlie asks --

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Did you ever hook up with guys when
          you worked here?

                       KATE
          Huh?

                    CHARLIE
          You know -- sneak off with a co-
          worker and do it against a pine
          tree or something?

                       KATE
          Um...no.
                                                             66.


                         CHARLIE
               I mean, if I were a teenage boy
               working with a stone cold fox like
               you I'd totally want to hook up
               with you here. Like...in the ginger
               bread house.

     Charlie puts his arms around Kate.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               You were probably the coolest girl
               in town -- and the prettiest. I'm
               sure everyone was in love with you.

     Kate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet.

53   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                  53

     Kate walks in to her class to find --

                           TEACHERS
               SURPRISE!

     -- a GROUP OF TEACHERS -- including Principal Barnes and Mr.
     Davies -- standing in the room, which has been decked out for
     a --

     -- BABY SHOWER.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               I couldn't keep quiet. Sorry. I
               just had to tell everyone so we
               could celebrate.

                         KATE
                   (shock)
               Oh...you shouldn't have.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               You don't have to thank me -- just
               open your presents!

     Kate looks at her desk which is stacked with PRESENTS wrapped
     in pink and baby blue wrapping paper. There's also a CAKE.

                           KATE
               Wow...

                           PRINCIPAL BARNES
               Go ahead.
                                                             67.


                         OTHER TEACHERS
               `C'mon, Kate! You're gonna love
               what I got you! Is it a boy or a
               girl?

     LATER

     Kate opens a present -- a MOBILE.

                         KATE
                   (seems nauseous)
               Oh, it's so...nice.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
                   (enthusiastic)
               It's to hang over the crib!

                           KATE
               Uh-huh...

     MONTAGE: Kate opens presents while the teachers CLAP.

     Eventually, Kate begins to CRY -- which everyone assumes are
     tears of joy.

     Principal Barnes takes a bite of cake.

                         PRINCIPAL BARNES
               Mmmm...it's so moist.

     Kate glances at Mr. Davies, who cringes.


54   EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                  54

     Kate walks to her car.

                           MR. DAVIES (O.S.)
               Kate!

     Kate looks back to see Mr. Davies running over -- but she
     doesn't reply or slow down.

                           MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               Kate?

                         KATE
                   (stops)
               What?

                         MR. DAVIES
               Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You
               have no idea how much this has been
               eating me up.
                                                  68.


Long beat.

                        KATE
             What you said to me was really
             fucked up.

                       MR. DAVIES
             I know.

                       KATE
             What were you even thinking?

                       MR. DAVIES
             I wasn't -- I was just...I try to
             be really honest.

                       KATE
             I get that. But you can't force
             your "honesty" on everyone you
             know.

Mr. Davies nods. He looks really embarrassed.

                       KATE (CONT'D)
                 (changing tone)
             I'm flattered that you
             have...feelings for me. I am. But
             I'm married.

                       MR. DAVIES
             I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize
             to your husband if you want.

                       KATE
             No -- you don't have to do that. I
             didn't even tell him. But...you
             can't say that to a girl -- like,
             ever.

                       MR. DAVIES
             Okay.

                        KATE
             Seriously. Consider that a rule of
             thumb.
                 (beat)
             Someday, you're gonna meet a nice,
             available lady -- but if you say
             "moist pussy" to her, you will
             never, ever, ever get to see that
             part of her body!
                                                             69.


                           MR. DAVIES
                    (even more embarrassed)
                Okay.
                    (beat)
                Thank you.
                    (nods)
                I feel like this was a really good
                talk.

     Kate forces a smile.


55   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT             55

     Kate stares at a --

     -- HALF-EATEN BIRTHDAY CAKE ("OWEN" is still sort of legible)
     on the kitchen table. It's totally mutilated.

     She walks out the back door into the                            *

     BACKYARD                                                        *

     where she finds                                                 *

     Charlie, Owen, and one of Owen's friends --                     *

     -- GREG, 21 --                                                  *

     -- listening to loud MUSIC while they play FOOSBALL.            *

     They're all SHIT-HOUSED.                                        *

                          GREG                                       *
                ...getting married would fucking                     *
                suck. I can't even imagine waking                    *
                up to the same person for the rest                   *
                of my life.                                          *

     Kate walks out.                                                 *
             GREG (CONT'D)                           OWEN
     What's up, Kate?                Hey, Kate.

                          KATE                                       *

                cake Jenny and I baked.                              *

                Yeah, thanks! You should get a                       *
                slice.                                               *

          I, uh...kinda thought we'd all eat           *
          it together.                                 *

                    CHARLIE                            *
          Baby -- I didn't even think about            *
          that. I'm sorry.                             *

                    OWEN                               *
          It was really good.                          *

                    GREG                               *
          We have plenty of tequila to make            *
          up for the cake.                             *

                    OWEN                               *
          Kate's in AA -- so she can't drink.          *
          She hasn't drank in forever -- like          *
          thirty-eight days or some shit.              *

                    KATE                               *
          Ninety-five days, actually.                  *

                    GREG                               *
          That sucks! Do you still smoke               *
          weed?                                        *

                    KATE                               *
          No, I wasn't a big weed smoker               *
          anyway.                                      *

                    OWEN                               *
          You smoked crack though, didn't              *
          you?                                         *

Kate's face goes blank. She stares at Charlie.         *

          Shit -- I hear crack gets you so             *
          high!                                        *

          No -- my wife doesn't smoke crack.           *

          Kate's not a crackhead or some               *

     MOMENTS LATER

     Charlie walks in to see Kate getting ready to go to bed.          *

                         CHARLIE
               Listen -- I'm sorry. He's
               drunk...really drunk.

                         KATE
               I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at
               you! You said you wouldn't tell
               anyone about what I did.

                         CHARLIE
               I'm...sorry. I...was drunk too when
               I told him.

                          KATE
               Great.
                   (beat)
               Why don't you guys just go to the
               bar now?

                         CHARLIE
               You wanna come?

                         KATE
               I'm hanging here.

                         CHARLIE
               I'm sure they have near-beer, baby.
               It'll be fun.

                         KATE
               I'm staying in.
                                                              72.


                         CHARLIE
               That sounds like a lot of fun.

                         KATE
               Bye.

     Beat.

                         CHARLIE
               I love you.

     Kate doesn't say a word.

               I love you...?

58   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MORNING                 58

     Kate stands at the BLACKBOARD -- teaching addition and
     subtraction to the class.

     A little girl -- ISABEL -- raises her hand.                       *

                         KATE
               Yes?

                         ISABEL                                        *
               Mrs. Hannah -- shouldn't you be
               more fatter?

                         KATE
               What?

                         ISABEL                                        *
               `Cause of the baby. My mom got real
               fat.

                         KATE
                   (taken off-guard)
               Well..."Shouldn't you be fatter?"
               is the correct way to ask that
               question.

     Kate goes back to the board -- clearly wanting to move on.
                                                           73.


                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Now, one day when you're very old
          and wise fourth graders, you'll
          learn about multiplication and --

                    ISABEL                                       *
          Mrs. Hannah -- Shouldn't you be
          more fat?

All the students look at Kate. She's on the spot. Flustered.

                       KATE
          Well, I...

Kate searches for something to say. Anything. But then she
blurts --

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          ...I'm not going to have a baby.

                       CLASS
          OOOH!

Kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it
back.

                    KATE
          See -- I was pregnant but, it
          wasn't my time, I suppose...

Another little girl -- WINNIE -- jumps in.                       *

                    WINNIE                                       *
          Mrs. Hannah -- did you kill the
          baby?

                    KATE
          WHAT? No -- of course not!

                    WINNIE                                       *
          `Cause my mom says that when you
          kill a baby you go to hell and you
          can't even go to church to ask god
          for forgiveness.

The students begin to WHISPER to each other.

Another boy -- TOBY -- asks --

                    TOBY
          Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to
          hell?
                                                          74.


                             KATE
                  No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay,
                  listen kids -- we shouldn't be
                  talking about this. But...
                      (beat)
                  ...sometimes women get pregnant and
                  then early on -- before it's even a
                  baby -- they stop being pregnant.

                            WINNIE                               *
                  Because a doctor murders it!

                             KATE
                  No -- not because a doctor   murdered
                  it.
                      (beat)
                  It's called a miscarriage.   That
                  means it wasn't my plan --   it's
                  just what happened.
                      (composes herself)
                  Does anyone want to ask me   any
                  questions?

     The class nods but seems silently freaked out.

                            KATE (CONT'D)
                  Let's get back to subtraction -- or
                  addition. Or both.


59   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY        59

     Kate sits with Mr. Davies eating lunch.

                            MR. DAVIES
                  Well, that was bound to happen at
                  some point. Kids notice things like
                  that.

     Kate nods.

                             MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
                  But I had no idea how pro-life
                  little Winnie Reddy is.                        *
                      (beat)
                  Remind me to wear my "May the fetus
                  you save be gay" T-shirt to the
                  next banana split night.

     Kate half-laughs.
                                                             75.


                         MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               And just think: the kids got a
               lesson about life and death that
               nobody planned on. I mean, you're
               years ahead of the standard
               curriculum for, uh, third graders.

                         KATE
               Does it matter that I lied? That I
               was never pregnant?

                         MR. DAVIES
               You want me to answer that as a
               friend or as someone who takes the
               twelve steps very seriously?

     Kate shrugs.

                          MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               Well, the good thing is that it's
               all over now. Principal Barnes will
               think you're a martyr for losing a
               baby.
                   (beat)
               The kids won't ask about it anymore
               and as long as you don't toss your
               cookies again you won't have to
               deal with it.

                         KATE
                   (long beat)
               And the bad news?

                         MR. DAVIES
               You lied. To your boss -- and a
               bunch of small children. Who trust
               you. And rely on you to help them
               differentiate right from wrong.

                         KATE
                   (slowly nods)
               That's all, huh?


60   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/DINING          60   *
     ROOM/KITCHEN/BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   *

     Kate and Charlie eat TAKE-OUT FOOD in SILENCE. Kate texts on
     her CELL PHONE -- not even paying attention to Charlie.

                            CHARLIE
               Well...
                   (beat)
                            (MORE)
                                                76.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          ...I gotta say -- this is the
          boringest meal I've had in about as
          long as I can remember.

Kate doesn't look up.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Who're you texting?

                    KATE
              (still looking down)
          Jenny.                                      *

                    CHARLIE
          She's like a parole officer.

                    KATE
          She's my sponsor.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm glad to know every little fuck-
          up I have is gonna become a topic
          of conversation with some chick I
          don't even know.

Kate finishes her text. Puts down her phone.

                    KATE
              (fake enthusiasm)
          So...what'd you do today, honey?

                     CHARLIE
          I finished some writing and met up
          with Owen to watch the game and
          toss a few back. Dear.
              (beat)
          You do anything special?

                    KATE
          I lied to my class again. I told
          them that I had a miscarriage.

Charlie LAUGHS.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          That's not funny.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up
          stuff is totally funny...in, you
          know -- a kinda fucked-up way.
                                              77.


                  KATE
        Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not
        actually having a baby.

                  CHARLIE
        God, Kate -- come on. What else
        were you supposed to do?

                   KATE
        Well, I feel like a piece of shit
        for lying.

                  CHARLIE
        It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is
        this what those meetings teach you?
        To make drama out of nothing?

                  KATE
        It's not nothing. I lied to little
        kids and to my boss because I can't
        take responsibility for my actions.

                  CHARLIE
        Why don't you go and tell the
        Principal that you were never
        pregnant? That the reason you puked
        is because you smoked crack all
        night? Would you feel better about
        yourself then?

Beat.

                  KATE
        I've been thinking about doing
        that, actually.
            (thinks about it)
        Yeah. I think I would feel better
        about myself.

                  CHARLIE
        Fine. Do it, then. I guess you
        don't need a job.

                  KATE
        I could be like you -- I could stay
        home drinking all day and never do
        anything responsible.

                   CHARLIE
            (hurt)
        I never do anything responsible?
        What about buying this house that
        we live in? Or the food that we're
        eating?
                                                 78.


                    KATE
          Having rich parents doesn't make
          you responsible. I think it's
          pretty much done the opposite.

Charlie looks stunned.                                 *

                    CHARLIE
          Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family
          that supports us -- and not the
          other way around.

                    KATE
          What the fuck is that supposed to
          mean?

                    CHARLIE
          Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad
          at me because my family has helped
          us out. You should be grateful we
          don't have to struggle.

                     KATE
          I wouldn't care if we struggled
          with money. I've struggled with
          money my whole life.
              (beat)
          I'd rather worry about where my
          next meal is coming from than if I -
          - in some drunken stupor -- married
          a man who just wants to party and
          meet bands.

                    CHARLIE
          What the fuck are you talking
          about?

                    KATE
          I'm talking about you being a baby.
          A selfish baby.

                    CHARLIE
          You know what?

                    KATE
          What?

                    CHARLIE
          I fucking hate AA! It turned you
          into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.

                    KATE
          At least I'm not drunk all the
          time.
                                                               79.


                         CHARLIE
               Yeah, you don't drink booze for
               three months and suddenly you're
               some saint? You have it all
               together and I'm just a baby?

     Kate doesn't answer.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to
               understand you. But it's hard.
               You're different and maybe it's
               good that you're different. Maybe
               I'm bad and bad for you or
               something -- because I didn't think
               the person you were before was so
               awful. I loved that person. Yeah,
               she drank a lot and she did some
               silly things...but she was my Kate.

                         KATE
               You loved that person? Do you not
               love me now?

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah, of course. But it's
               different. You're different.

                          KATE
               Before I was a mess.
                   (beat)
               I'm finally getting my life
               together -- and you loved me more
               before?

     Charlie looks at the floor.

                          CHARLIE
                   (soft)
               Kinda, yeah.

     Charlie looks like he immediately regrets what he said.


61   INT./EXT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT                 61   *

     Kate follows Jenny from her patio to her kitchen as she          *
     cleans up.                                                       *

                         KATE
               I feel so fucking weird right now --
               Charlie doesn't love me like he
               used to and I've lied to my
               students multiple times.
                         (MORE)
                                                   80.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
                  (beat)
             I just don't feel...normal right
             now.

                        JENNY                            *
             Well, you're not normal.
                 (beat)
             None of us are.

                       KATE
             Everything in life isn't connected
             to being an alcoholic.

                        JENNY                            *
             I'm not just talking about
             alcoholics.
                 (beat)
             People are fucking weird. We all
             have a lot of shit we carry around
             in our heads that doesn't make
             sense.
                 (beat)
             At least alcoholics have tools to
             work through it.                            *

                          KATE
             "Steps"...

                       JENNY                             *
             Yeah, steps -- and talking and
             listening and crying...

                       KATE
             I have the crying part covered.

                        JENNY                            *
             I know, right? I think my first
             year I cried tears I'd been saving
             since I was eight.
                 (beat)
             It's hard to live your
             life...honestly. You know?

Kate nods.

                        JENNY (CONT'D)                   *
             Any idea what you're gonna do about
             your school situation? What you're
             gonna say?

Kate shakes her head.
                                                             81.


                         KATE
               I don't know what I'm gonna do
               about anything.

                         JENNY                                         *
               Listen...you wanna stay in my guest                     *
               room tonight? You can watch movies,
               get some good sleep...?

                         KATE
               You sure that's okay?

                          JENNY                                        *
               Yeah, of course. That's why I spent
               money on a guest bed -- so people
               could sleep in it.
                   (beat)
               I know it might feel like it, but
               really, you don't have to figure
               everything out tonight.
                   (smiles)
               You've got time.


62   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                     62

     Kate goes into her classroom and finds a NOTE on the desk.


63   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY            63

     Principal Barnes hugs Kate.

                          PRINCIPAL BARNES
               I'm so sorry, Kate.
                   (beat)
               I haven't told many people this,
               but when I was young -- younger
               than you...I lost a child too.

     Kate's stunned. Looks like she feels terrible.

                         KATE
               I'm...I'm really sorry.

                          PRINCIPAL BARNES
               It's okay. It was a long, long time
               ago. Still hurts sometimes. But
               eventually...you move on. You have
               to.
                   (beat)
               Have a seat.

     Kate sits down.
                                                        82.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          I got a phone call from a very
          upset parent. That's how I found
          out about...you know. Frankly, I'm
          not sure why you didn't feel like
          you could tell me.

                    KATE
          I freaked out -- a student asked
          why I wasn't fat and I just froze
          up and then another student was
          saying I killed my baby and I
          didn't know what to do.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I'm not angry with you -- but I
          need to be clear that this doesn't
          happen again.

                    KATE
          It won't. I promise that.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          By "not happening again," I mean
          that you don't discuss any
          controversial topics -- things the
          school board deems "family matters"
          with your class.
              (beat)
          No sex. No god. No drugs and
          alcohol.

                       KATE
          Okay, I...

Kate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath. She
seems...exhausted.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          ...I can't keep doing this. I feel
          awful.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (confused)
          I know this all must be hard for
          you --

                     KATE
          No. You don't understand.
              (beat)
          I have to be honest with you.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          What do you mean?
                                                    83.


                    KATE
          Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever
          pregnant.

Principal Barnes looks shocked.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I lied -- to the class and to you --
          because I was scared.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          But...you vomited in class.

                    KATE
          I know. And when that happened I
          didn't know what to do because the
          truth is --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Oh, my god -- are you really ill?
          Is it cancer?

                     KATE
          No, well, yes. I have a disease,
          but, um...
              (beat)
          ...it's alcoholism.

Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          What?

                    KATE
          I've been working on it. I'm one-
          hundred days sober. When that
          happened I'd been out drinking and
          was hung over and --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          You vomited in front of children
          because you were hung over?

                    KATE
          Yes.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          And lied, saying that you were
          pregnant?

                    KATE
          Well, a student asked if I was
          pregnant -- and "yes" just kind of
          fell out of my mouth.
                                                84.


Principal Barnes looks disgusted.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          That's sick, Kate.

                       KATE
          I know.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          No, I don't think you understand
          how wrong that is. To lie to me --
          to the children. You know I felt so
          terrible for you when I found out
          that you had a mis -- ?
              (beat)
          -- how can you play with people's
          emotions like that?

                    KATE
          I was sick.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Jesus...you told us you had a
          miscarriage.

                       KATE
          I'm sorry.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I threw you a baby shower.

                     KATE
          I'm really sorry. I am. I've been
          wanting to tell you the truth
          because honesty has become really
          important to me. I'm in AA now and
          doing the steps and working with a
          sponsor and everything.
              (beat)
          It's really hard. I mean, I think
          my husband might hate me, and --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I'm sorry, but what you did is
          totally irresponsible.

                       KATE
          I know.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (beat)
          I can't have you here anymore.
                                                        85.


                    KATE
              (surprised)
          Am I being fired?

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          No, no -- the state wouldn't allow
          that without a report. I'm not
          going to write a report. Because,
          frankly, I have no idea what that
          report would say.
              (beat)
          But I'm forcing you to take a leave
          of absence and I think it's in your
          best interest if you find a job
          elsewhere.

                    KATE
          Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm
          doing the right things now.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          I believe you -- or I want to. I
          really do. But honey -- I believed
          you before.
              (beat)
          I'll have a sub take over your
          class starting tomorrow. It's late
          enough in the year that we can just
          say you're having personal problems
          --

Principal Barnes looks at Kate.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          -- which seems to be the truth.

                    KATE
          Principal Barnes --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Not another word. I'm upset right
          now -- very upset -- and I think
          I'm doing you a favor by not
          reporting you.

Kate struggles to say something, to try to explain herself
but no words come out until she musters --

                       KATE
          Thank you.

Kate stands, defeated, and leaves the Principal's office.
                                                             86.


64   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - STAIRS/HALLWAY - DAY               64   *

     Kate glumly marches down the stairs -- holding a BOX filled      *
     with some of her things (including the BABY SHOWER GIFTS).

     Mr. Davies stops her.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Kate -- what's going on?

                         KATE
               I told Principal Barnes about
               everything.

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (terrified)
               What? Everything? Did you tell her
               about...?

     Mr. Davies gestures to Kate's crotch.

                            KATE
                      (confused)
               Huh?
                   (gets it)
               Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm
               an alcoholic. And that I lied. And
               she fired me.

                         MR. DAVIES
                   (relieved)
               Oh...
                   (but concerned, too)
               ...my god, Kate -- I'm sorry.

                          KATE
               I've been going to AA and trying to
               be sober and this is what it got
               me.
                   (beat)
               Fired, for telling the truth.

     Mr. Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kate's shoulder.

                         MR. DAVIES
               I'm sorry. I wish there was
               something I could do.

                         KATE
               I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a
               fuck up. I'm just like my mom.
                                                               87.


                         MR. DAVIES
                   (confused)
               No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart
               woman Kate. You can't let this get
               you down.

                         KATE
               I gotta go.

     Mr. Davies takes Kate's box of things from her.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Let me walk you to your car.

     Kate throws her arms around Mr. Davies and begins to --

     -- full-on SOB.

     Mr. Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to
     comfort Kate.


65   INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                                   65

     Kate cries as she drives.

     She glances in the backseat at --

     -- all the baby shower gifts --

     -- and sobs even harder.


66   INT. DIVE BAR - DAY                                          66

     Kate walks into a near-empty, depressing dive. She nervously
     sits at the bar.

     The BARTENDER -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled      *
     up -- approaches.

                         BARTENDER
               What do you need?

                         KATE
               Whiskey. Double.

     The bartender gives Kate her drink. Kate immediately downs
     it.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               Can I have another one?
                                                        88.


                    BARTENDER
          Sure -- you gotta pay for the first
          one, though. Eight bucks.

Kate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down.

The bartender pours her another shot.

LATER

Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up
at the bar, nursing her BEER.

                    BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a
          downer or anything `cause I take it
          you've had a bad day, but um... I
          think you need to go home.

                       KATE
          Why?

                    BARTENDER
          Cause you're pretty drunk -- and
          it's four p.m.

                    KATE
          What about him?

Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          You're not kicking him out.

                    BARTENDER
          I'm just trying to be a pal.

                     KATE
          Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I
          just got fired, and I just quit AA.
              (beat)
          It didn't work.

                       BARTENDER
          Oh, boy...

                    KATE
          You know what? I was fine -- had a
          husband that loved me and maybe I
          sometimes did embarrassing stuff,
          but it was a phase.
                    (MORE)
                                                        89.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I go to AA and sober my husband and
          I start fighting and stop fucking --
          and sober I get fired! Isn't that
          what's supposed to not happen?

                     BARTENDER
          Wow, okay, well...I'm real sorry.
          But this place gets a little nuts
          after sundown and I don't think a
          pretty girl who just left AA should
          be here.
              (beat)
          I'm gonna call you a cab.

                    KATE
          NO! I don't want a cab. I want --
              (glances around)
          -- drugs. Can you hook me up?

The bartender rolls his eyes.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          C'mon...let's go out back and smoke
          some crack.

                    BARTENDER
          Lady, you're done.

                    KATE
          You think I'm above smoking crack?
          `Cause I'm not. And are you really
          gonna tell me you're not a little
          attracted to me...?

Kate leans across the bar, trying to look "seductive" -- but
she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool.

                      BARTENDER
          No.

                    KATE
          Just a teensy bit...?

                    BARTENDER
          Not in the slightest.

                    KATE
          Well...you might want to consider
          investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause
          I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm
          smart. And I'm...

Kate begins to cry.
                                                             90.


                         KATE (CONT'D)
               ...a good person.

                         BARTENDER
               I think it's time for you to go
               home. Now are you gonna let me call
               a cab?

                         KATE
                   (suddenly angry)
               NO! I'm not. I've got friends.
               They'll pick me up.

                         BARTENDER
               You do that.

                         KATE
               I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams
               about me.

     The bartender takes a long look at Kate -- as though he's
     trying to size up if she's insane.

                         BARTENDER
               Hope that works out for you.

                          KATE
               Can't believe my luck. I just want
               to get drunk and a bartender won't
               let me.
                   (beat)
               Life is stupid.

     Kate stands up -- almost falling over -- and glares at the
     bartender.

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               You hear me? Life is FUCKING
               STUPID!

     Kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar, winks at
     him, then picks up his drink and chugs it.


67   INT. MR. DAVIES' CAR (MOVING) - DAY                          67   *

     Kate is slumped in the back seat.

     In the front seat is Mr. Davies and Jenny.                        *

                         KATE
               Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd
               you bring her?
                                                             91.


                          JENNY                                     *
                We're worried about you, Kate.

                          KATE
                    (accusing)
                Parole officer.

                          MR. DAVIES
                She's your sponsor.

                          JENNY                                     *
                It's gonna be okay. You stumbled.
                You'll get back up.

     Silence.

                          KATE
                How `bout we drive to Mexico and
                party our asses off? My treat.

     Jenny and Dave glance back at Kate --                          *

     -- whose face reveals what a bad state she's in.

                          KATE (CONT'D)
                    (holding back tears)
                Sounds fucking stupendous, right?


68   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY                         68

     Kate gets out of the car.                                      *

     Mr. Davies and Jenny watch with concerned expressions as --    *

     -- Kate stumbles to her front door.

                          JENNY                                     *
                Kate! Are you sure you're --

                          KATE
                    (over her shoulder)
                Fuck off.


69   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING                      69
     ROOM/KITCHEN/HALLWAY/BEDROOM - DAY                             *

     Charlie plays a VIDEO GAME -- with the TV hooked up through
     his STEREO SPEAKERS.

     Kate opens the doors and walks in, wobbly.
                                                           92.


                    CHARLIE
              (not looking up)
          Babe -- you gotta hear this with
          the speakers hooked up. It's
          insane.

Kate says nothing. Just stares at Charlie.

Charlie looks up -- and is surprised to see Kate clearly
drunk.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Whoa...what happened to you?

Charlie stops playing the game.

                    KATE
          I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job.

                      CHARLIE
          Oh, no...

                    KATE
          We got any drinks?

                    CHARLIE
          Uh...we have soda. I can make
          coffee.

                    KATE
          Don't be cute with me. You know
          what I mean.

                    CHARLIE
          So...I guess you aren't doing the
          AA thing anymore?

                    KATE
          What gave that away?

Kate turns and goes to the kitchen --

-- reappearing a moment later with a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, salt
and limes.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Come on, baby -- let's do some
          shots.

                    CHARLIE
          What's going on?
                                                        93.


                    KATE
          I'm celebrating. What the fuck does
          it look like?

Kate takes a shot.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Are you gonna be a little girl or
          are you gonna drink with me?

                    CHARLIE
          I don't know what the right thing
          to do here is.

                     KATE
          Okay, so let me see if this makes
          sense: you say you miss the old
          Kate -- the Kate who drinks and
          blacks out and has fun.
              (beat)
          Well...here she is.

Kate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than
fun.

                    CHARLIE
          Baby, I didn't mean that. I was
          just being a jerk.

                    KATE
          Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now
          you won't drink with me?

                    CHARLIE
          I don't know. Having a beer or
          something is one thing, but...I
          think you really may have a
          problem.

Kate LAUGHS.

                    KATE
          Well thanks for all the support
          when I was trying to be sober!

Kate takes another shot.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm sorry. I didn't realize --

                    KATE
          Of course you didn't realize! You
          don't fucking care about me.
                                                        94.


                    CHARLIE
          What are you talking about?! Of
          course I care about you. I love
          you.

Kate takes a shot and approaches Charlie.

                    KATE
          I love you too. Love is the easy
          part. It's the rest of the shit
          that's hard.

Kate kisses Charlie.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Take off your pants.

Charlie gently pushes Kate away.

                    CHARLIE
          Look -- I think you should get to
          sleep. You're really wasted.

                    KATE
          I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.

Kate pulls Charlie -- who struggles -- down to the
couch...and straddles him.

                    CHARLIE
          Please, will you stop?

                    KATE
          No! I want you to fuck me!

Charlie calmly tries to move Kate off of him.

                    CHARLIE
          Really. This is weird.

                    KATE
          Be a man and fuck your wife!

Charlie -- who's creeped out now -- forcefully pushes Kate
off.

                    CHARLIE
          No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong
          with you?

Kate has become quite angry and belligerent by this point --
and begins picking up HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS and throwing them at
Charlie.
                                                        95.


                    KATE
          With me? With me?! What the fuck is
          wrong with me? I try hard and I get
          shit on! Fucked up family, fired
          from my job -- this marriage.
          Nothing's wrong with me! What's
          wrong with YOU?!

                    CHARLIE
          Kate, you need to --

                    KATE
          What? What? What do I need? I can't
          drink because I'm crazy or
          something and I can't stay sober
          because of you!

                    CHARLIE
          You're blaming other people for
          your problems.

Kate picks the tequila bottle back up, takes a sip, then --

-- runs at Charlie and tackles him to the ground.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Stop it! You're acting like a
          freak!

Kate rips Charlie's SHIRT --

-- and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him,
as if she's about to hit him with it.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          No! What's wrong with you?

Kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at Charlie.
She begins to weep.

                    KATE
          I can't be sober and be with you.

Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like
she's about to hit Charlie with the bottle, she --

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila.

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on
tight. With the bottle at Kate's lips -- and tequila pouring
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the
bottle.
                                                               96.


                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

                                                        FADE IN:


70   INT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - KITCHEN - DAY                 70   *

     Kate wears a UNIFORM and carefully works on a CAKE.                 *

     On the other side of the kitchen, Jenny makes APPETIZERS.           *

                         JENNY                                           *
               How's it coming?

                         KATE
               You tell me.

     Jenny walks over and tries the icing.                               *

                          JENNY                                          *
                   (nods with approval)                                  *
               Delicious.                                                *

                         KATE
                   (proud)
               Thanks.


71   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                          71

     A middle-aged MAN stands at a podium in front of a medium
     sized group of PEOPLE -- about twenty-five or so, including
     Kate, Jenny, and Mr. Davies -- and says --                          *

                          CHUCK                                          *
               At this meeting we give cakes to
               celebrate sober birthdays. We have
               one birthday tonight -- for Kate,
               for one year.
                   (beat)
               Jenny and Dave are giving her the                         *
               cake.

     Kate hugs everyone -- then blows out ONE CANDLE on a CAKE
     before standing at the podium.

                         KATE
               Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic.

                           GROUP
               Hi, Kate.
                                                 97.


                     KATE
          I've heard that your best day
          drinking is worse than your worst
          day sober.
              (beat)
          Well...that is SO not true! I had
          amazing times drinking, dancing,
          and laughing...feeling like the
          most adorable, charming girl in the
          world. And I was adorable.
              (beat)
          I'd piss my pants, but I was still
          cute.

People in the crowd LAUGH a little bit.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          When I first tried getting sober, I
          figured that as long as I didn't
          drink...everything else would just
          magically work out. But it didn't.
              (beat)
          My marriage fell apart. I got fired
          from my job. And that shit happened
          SOBER! I never read that in any
          pamphlet...
              (shakes her head)
          ...that isn't what I signed up for.
                (beat)
          Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty
          slogan I've heard in the rooms is
          that when you're sober for a bit
          and drink again "the disease waits
          for you, picks up where it left
          off."
              (beat)
          I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE
          those slogans. They all sound like
          bumper stickers. But, I have to
          admit...for me, that last one is
          pretty damn true.
              (beat)
          When I drink...I become another
          person. And that person is a pretty
          big asshole. Well, unless you want
          to give me drugs or buy me drinks --
          then that person is awesome.

People knowingly LAUGH.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          I wasn't happy being the "good-time
          girl," though. And honestly, I
          wasn't very good at it.
                    (MORE)
                                                             98.

                          KATE (CONT'D)
                   (beat)
               My life is really different than it
               was a year ago. I live alone. I'm
               bored a lot more. I have a job that
               pays a lot less.
                   (beat)
               I'm thankful for the program -- for
               my friends in here who took the
               time to help me and give a shit
               about me.

     Kate glances at Jenny and Mr. Davies.                             *

                         KATE (CONT'D)
               There are people that used to be a
               part of my life that I miss -- a
               lot -- but...
                   (long beat)
               ...I'm really grateful for this
               boring new life of mine.

     Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP.


72   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                             72   *

     Charlie, Owen, and a woman -- MILLIE -- stand at the bar,
     drinking BEER and WHISKEY SHOTS. Owen speaks -- but Millie
     seems way more into Charlie.

                           OWEN
               I was in North Carolina for a while                     *
               -- Durham -- playing minor league
               ball. I had some real heat. That's
               when I met Crash, here.
                    (gestures to Charlie)
               He'd been sent down to single-A to
               teach me how to carry myself as a
               pro ball-player. We got involved
               with the same woman -- an older
               chick -- but Crash won her in the
               end.
                    (beat)
               He's really taught me
               some...important life-lessons.

     Millie nods.

                         MILLIE
               Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to
               meet.

                         OWEN
               Yeah. It is.
                                                         99.


                    MILLIE
          You guys are sorta like that
          movie...what's it called?

                    OWEN
              (plays dumb)
          I don't know. Which one?
              (to Charlie)
          Do you know what movie she means?

Charlie -- who's pretty hammered -- shakes his head.

                    MILLIE
          "Bull"...something? What is it?

Charlie and Owen feign ignorance.

                    MILLIE (CONT'D)
          Whatever. It'll come to me.
              (to Charlie; flirty)
          So...what do you do now, Crash?

                    CHARLIE
          I write about music.

                       MILLIE
          Really?

Owen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of
          magazines. But print really is
          dead. So now most of my stuff winds
          up on websites. Which is
          depressing. `Cause you can't hold
          it -- you can just look at it. It's
          like...

Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence.
Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm.

                       MILLIE
          Like what?

                       CHARLIE
          Huh?

                    MILLIE
          You were talking about writing for
          websites and you kinda trailed off,
          honey.
                                                   100.


                    OWEN
              (trying to save the
               situation)
          So, Crash -- why don't you tell
          this nice lady about the 21 days
          you were up in "The Show," and what
          the crowds were like, and --

                    CHARLIE
          It was crazy. I...

Charlie drifts off for a moment.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
              (to Millie)
          I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a
          great lady. You have lovely hands
          and hair but...

Charlie begins to walk away, wobbly on his feet.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          ...I'm gonna go to the...I'm just
          gonna go.

Charlie stumbles off.

                    MILLIE
              (as Charlie leaves)
          You want a ride...?

Charlie exits the bar.

                    MILLIE (CONT'D)
              (to Owen)
          Um...is he cool to drive?

                    OWEN
          Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his
          bicycle.

                    MILLIE
          He rides a bicycle?

                     OWEN
          Oh, yeah --
              (smiles)
          -- as a teenager, he was a bike
          racing champion growing up in
          Bloomington, Indiana. He and his
          friends were called the "Cutters" --
          and they beat a bunch of rich
          college kids in this big race. It
          was great.

73   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                         73

     Charlie rides his BICYCLE down the street. Swerving all over
     the place, he's obviously drunk.

     Red and Blue LIGHTS flash behind him. Charlie turns to see --

     -- a POLICE OFFICER.                                             *


74   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY             74

     Charlie leaves Kate a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.

                          CHARLIE
                   (into phone; seems sort of
                    nervous)
               So, I got into a little trouble --
               drunk in public. On a bicycle.
                   (beat)
               Um, I was thinking...maybe I need
               to go to one of those meetings. I'd
               like to go with you, though. If
               that's cool.
                   (beat)
               Let me know if we could discuss it
               sometime, okay? Maybe you could
               come over to our -- um, my house?
                   (beat)
               Uh...yeah. Thanks.

     Charlie hangs up the phone.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (to himself)
               "Let me know if we could discuss it
               sometime?"
                   (shakes his head)
               Such an idiot...


75   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STREET/FRONT YARD - DAY       75   *

     Kate and Charlie stand by Kate's car, which is parked in
     front by the street. She's just arrived. Awkward tension.

                         CHARLIE
               Miss our house?
                                                       102.


                     KATE
           Um...yeah. Sometimes.

                     CHARLIE
               (hesitant)
           Miss me?

Beat.

                      KATE
           Sometimes.
               (long beat)
           I've been sober for a year.

                       CHARLIE
           Really?

                       KATE
           Yeah.

Kate reaches into her purse and takes out her ONE YEAR CHIP,
showing it to Charlie.

                     CHARLIE
           They gave you that?

                     KATE
           Yeah. A couple of days ago.
           Tuesday.

                      CHARLIE
           Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's
           really...really...just great. I
           mean it.
               (beat)
           Tuesday is the night I got pulled
           over.
               (laughs)
           Parallel lives, huh?

Kate rolls her eyes.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           So -- you dating anyone?

                      KATE
               (taken aback)
           Charlie...

                       CHARLIE
           Are you?

Silence.
                                                103.


                    KATE
          No.

Charlie seems relieved.

                     CHARLIE
          Me either. Owen keeps trying to get
          me to be his "wing-man" and it's
          ridiculous and these girls in bars
          are so lame and I just keep
          thinking how I wish I was meeting
          you in a bar for the first time and
          I didn't come with any baggage and
          I could buy you a drink and flirt
          with you all night and ask for your
          number.
              (beat)
          Wanna go out sometime?

                    KATE
          I don't think it's a good idea.

Charlie nods. Long beat.

                    CHARLIE
          I fucked up, didn't I?

Kate looks down, doesn't speak.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a
          beautiful woman who used to love me
          and now when I see her she doesn't
          even want to look me in the eyes.

                    KATE
          Charlie, please don't do this.

                    CHARLIE
          I miss you. I miss the way you
          taste and smell and...I miss things
          about you that used to drive me
          nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's
          music and fake punk-rock from the
          90's...

                     KATE
          I don't like shitty 80's music.
              (beat)
          I like good 80's music.
                                                               104.


                         CHARLIE
               ...and all I want to do is touch
               you one more time to just, remember
               -- to make sure it was real.

     Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a
     slight smile.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (changing course)
               Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional
               fucking idiot.


76   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY      76   *

     Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a
     number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general,
     the room looks more "dude."

                         KATE
               You look really thin.

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah?

                         KATE
               When did you last eat?

                         CHARLIE
               I dunno -- like...I'm not sure.
                   (seems slightly concerned                           *
                    that he can't remember)
               I think, um...

                         KATE
               Should we order something?

                         CHARLIE
               Sure, yeah -- or I could make a
               bacon and egg sandwich...

                         KATE
               I don't know. I haven't really been
               doing the meat thing.

                          CHARLIE
               Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then
               meat.
                   (beat)
               Have you given up fun, too?

     Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she
     finds him funny.
                                                             105.


                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                   (off Kate)
               Sorry. Bad joke.

     Kate cracks a smile.

                         KATE
               Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But
               I'm gonna make them.

     Charlie raises his eyebrows.

                            CHARLIE
               Okay...

     LATER

     Kate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs.

     Charlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER.

     Kate glances at him.

                            CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Sorry.

     Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge.

                         KATE
               I don't care if you drink a beer.

                            CHARLIE
               You sure?

                         KATE
               Yeah. Whatever.

                         CHARLIE
                   (thinks about it)
               No...I'm good.

     LATER

     Kate stands by the stove and watches as --

     -- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the
     bacon and egg sandwich.

     Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much.


77   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - TWILIGHT          77

     Kate and Charlie play croquet.                                  *
                                                          106.


They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a
while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.

                       CHARLIE
             Have you been playing a lot?

                       KATE
             I haven't played in over a year.

                       CHARLIE
             Then how're you beating me?

                       KATE
             I don't know. Innate talent?

They keep playing.

                       CHARLIE
             I haven't met anyone even vaguely
             interesting since we separated.

                       KATE
             Um...stick to the game, okay?

Long beat.

                       CHARLIE
             I've been masturbating like crazy.

                          KATE
             Charlie --

                       CHARLIE
             I miss you.

                          KATE
             Stop it.

                       CHARLIE
             Okay. Fine.

Beat.

                       KATE
             You could've been killed.

                       CHARLIE
                 (confused)
             What?

                       KATE
             Riding your bike -- drunk.
                                                   107.


                    CHARLIE
          But I wasn't.

                    KATE
          But is that really the point?

                    CHARLIE
          What are trying to say?

                     KATE
              (beat)
          I worry about you.

                     CHARLIE
              (laughs)
          Yeah, I can understand that. I used
          to worry about you. But now I know
          you're okay.
              (beat)
          That makes me happy...I mean, it
          fucking sucks that you're better
          off without me but I'm glad you're
          doing well.

No reply from Kate.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Would you move back in if I came to
          meetings?

                    KATE
          You should go for yourself, not to
          make me happy.

                    CHARLIE
          But, would you?

                    KATE
          I'm not moving back in.

That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          Listen, I should go. It's gonna get
          dark soon.

                    CHARLIE
          We can always turn the lights on.

                    KATE
          I don't know...

Beat.
                                                         108.


                    CHARLIE
          So, would you at least...let me
          take you out on a date?

Kate says nothing.

                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Maybe...?

Kate shakes her head.

Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
              (new direction)
          Last question: can we just...play
          one more game?

Kate doesn't answer.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          C'mon...you keep kicking my ass.
          It's embarrassing. You've gotta
          give me a chance to redeem myself.
              (soft)
          Please.

Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...

...but she also doesn't say no.

There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.

                                               CUT TO BLACK.

                       THE END

          Wall-to-wall surveillance set-up. Two FBI AGENTS: DONALD
          CARRUTHERS 30's and RICHARD MESSNER 30's, man the post,
          staring at video monitors. Both hold telephoto images; shaky,
          long lens shots of a mansion some distance away. Messner
          tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall. One is
          labeled "Subject SIDNEY K. SERNA: UNDERBOSS/Sparazza Family."
          
          The other is labeled "Subject VICTOR "BABY BUZZ" PADICHE

          Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just
          gotta outta there--

          --he's doing it then, huh--
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          --yeah, now lemme finish, I was
          eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay
          this thing out, since the information
          might be a little loose--

          So what I heard downstairs there is
          that they got a guy, some Swede,
          real badass, supposedly a "specialist"
          and they're bringing him over. Now
          he ain't coming cheap-- so, I'm
          thinkin' we jump, do this in the
          next day or so, get to Israel before
          the Swede can, we got chits, y'see?
          We're in a power position. Grab
          him, ransom him back, pick up that
          nut, we're that much closer to having
          our own thing.
          
                      PADICH (V.O.)
          --I see that, yeah, s'smart move,
          for us anyway.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Trust me, we keep our mouths shut,
          go about our thing, play the part,
          nobody suspects us.

          The old man's on the fade Buzzy,
          fuck him, y'know? And that hurts, I
          don't like saying that, but hey, our
          livelihood, our lifeboat, y'get?
          
                      PADICHE
          No question, no, you're right. We
          gotta do what's good for us now.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)

          they'll kick ransom for that little
          prick, assuming we get to'm.

                    Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline,
                    yet and before I get to it, one more
                    thing I heard, little curious, should
                    probably bring it up...Primo wants
                    Israel's heart. The actual thing,
                    the organ.

                    Sparazza is rumored to have performed
                    in excess of one-hundred and thirty
                    contract murders, including one of
                    the bureau's most celebrated agents.
                    Freeman Heller. You heard of "The
                    Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.

                    No. He worked for the O.S.S. before
                    joining the Bureau in its heyday.
                    He was the first operative assigned

          Heller oversees every aspect of his transformation, radically

                    And as a result, his undercover work
                    was wildly successful. He eventually
                    reached the rank of Capo inside the
                    Carlotta crime family...but through
                    some internal slip-up, his cover was
                    compromised and Primo Sparazza was
                    given the contract to kill him.

                    There wasn't enough evidence to bring
                    formal charges, so the case never

                    Over the years, the serious crimes
                    with which he was thought to be
                    involved, including Heller's murder,
                    could never be traced back to him.

          Daybreak. Sunlight streams in, soft suffusion, the color of
          good scotch. PRIMO SPARAZZA, 86, lies on a hospital bed, an
          O2 mask shrouding deep-set, sunken eyes, cataract-grey, gazing
          out at a four-walled world. Someone enters the room, awaiting
          approval to approach...Sparazza, turning, seeing the man,
          summoning him over with a feeble finger wag. The man reaches
          him, kneeling down, ring-kissing reverent, whispering:
          
                                MAN
                    ...he's here now...
          
          Sparazza nods. The man exits. After a moment, the door opens
          again...and another MAN enters, walking slowly toward
          Sparazza's bedside. He sets down his luggage, a black leather
          valise. The travel tags originate in Stockholm:
          
          The Swede has arrived.

          Soaring across the pristine deep blue waters of Lake Tahoe.

          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO -- MORNING
          
          BUDDY ISRAEL, bathrobe, boxers, bags under his eyes. He
          absently shuffles cards, pulling aces as if by touch,
          telepathy. He gazes out at the snow-packed peaks. Behind
          him; post-bacchanalia...the ugly morning after. Prostitutes,
          passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and stiletto
          heels, lying amongst smashed vodka bottles and ashtrays,
          coke-covered tabletops and tipped room service trays. -
          
          Israel, sober now...contemptuous of it all. He starts walking
          around them the way you would casualties on a battlefield.
          His bathrobe brushes over, terrycloth catching one of the
          hooker's wigs, tugging it free. Israel looks down, zooming
          in on her scalp, sees dandruff and scars, gags disgust and
          disdain. He steps, the wigs pulls. He stops and slips the
          bathrobe off, letting it fall rather than pull her wig the
          rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains.
          
          He shuffles, begins dropping Aces on their bodies like dead
          enemy soldiers. One of his bodyguards enters; a bulging,
          slow-witted, ex-bodybuilder by the name of HUGO CROOP.

                    did you say!
          
          Hugo looks up, seems confused. Moments pass. Israel, the

                                ISRAEL
                    Then why are you still looking at me
                    like I'm asking for the square root
                    of something! What did you say!?
          
          Hugo, still unsure, speaks in spite of it.
          
                                HUGO
                    I said that we were returning his
                    call and you were real concerned,
                    because he sounded real concerned.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Look at that, we didn't have to fill
                    up the whole blackboard after all.
                    Now, do you know anything about that?
          
          Israel wrist-flicks a playing card, it embeds a sofa cushion
          like a ninja throwing star, right next to a beige coat.
          
                                  HUGO
                    About what?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Look at the collar on that coat...
          
          Hugo, wary, walking over, inspecting the coat from a distance.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    What's that look like, that stain?
          
          Hugo edges closer, looks down at the coat, squints.
          
                                HUGO
                    I dunno...Cinnamon roll?
          
                                 ISRAEL
                    Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though.

                    still safely qualifies as a "tough,

          Hugo takes another pull off the Mylanta bottle, moving slowly,
          like most morons do, avoiding eye contact at all cost.
          
                                HUGO

          Cards dance, Israel's hands moves at lightspeed, he reaches
          into Hugo's shirt front and pulls a playing card out...Joker.
          
                                ISRAEL
                        (showing him the card)
                    No. Be sure. Be resolute.    You stand
                    alone on that summit.
          
          The phone rings. Hugo, wobbly, what-to-do...? Buddy fires
          all fifty-two cards into his face. The beast barely blinks.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    Get the phone, it might be Gill,
                    then get out of my sight.
          
          Hugo, furtive look to the floor, all those scattered cards,
          then, back to the boss, "should I?"
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    No. The cards can stay there. Get
                    The Goddamn Phone.

          A cellphone being lifted, revealing Special Agent Carruthers.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Yes Sir. Go ahead.

                    We're three miles from The Nomad
                    now. We'll be awaiting word.
          
          He clicks off. Messner occupies the passenger seat, reviewing
          surveillance tape, portable headphones on, mini-DAT player
          in his lap. He listens to the following excerpt:
          
                                                                       24.

                    --so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this
                    in the next day or so, get to Israel
                    before the Swede can--
          
          Messner pulls the headphones off.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Anything on the Swede?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Only the mention made in that phone
                    call. There's no Swedish hitman of
                    any renown, much less one with a
                    million dollar day rate.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Maybe he's that good. Never been
                    caught, no criminal record.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maybe.
          
          Messner, sets the gear on the floorboard, stretches. He
          turns over photographs of Victor Padiche and Sidney Serna.
          (the same ones that were tacked to the corkboard of the
          surveillance van in the opening)

                    I tell you, engineering this kind of
                    play against Sparazza, going to the
                    lengths these guys are going
                    to...they're playing some long odds.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    And a very bad gamble.
          
                                MESSNER

                    Well... This is as good a place for
                    it as any I guess.

          INT. CHOW SHACK BUFFET -- MORNING
          
          Tahoe's "First and Finest" all seasons Buffet. THE CAMERA
          FINDS: A slicker older cat in a Guyabera shirt, mid-fifties,
          spotted skin, sun damaged, pocked with pre-cancerous black.
          We recognize him from the mugshots and surveillance video:
          It's VICTOR PADICHE. Sykes and Watters enter FRAME. Padiche
          stands, greeting them, smiling-cigarette-stained-dentures...
          
                                                                      25.
          
                                PADICHE
                    Girls, wonderful, here, sit.
          
          Watters scoots in right next to Sykes, gets comfy. Sykes
          seems a put off by the proximity, ignores it for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Okay, so...you're here, really nice
                    isn't it? Brisk weather, but nice.
                        (as WAITRESS approaches)
                    Coffee? Anything? I didn't want to
                    order for you.
          
                                WATTERS
                    No, we're cool.
          
                                PADICHE
                    Fabulous.
                        (to Waitress)
                    I'm fine sweetheart, thanks.
                        (beat, back to girls)
                    Okay, so...welcome to the south shore!
                        (big smile, then)
                    So, just jumpin' right in, just in
                    terms of this thing, our thing. I
                    spoke to Lorenzo this morning, he
                    says y'got somethin' more or less
                    put together, plan'a attack and me
                    and my associate Mr. Serna, who I
                    can put on the phone hear, we'd
                    love t'hear it.
          
          Watters and Sykes, non-responsive, staring...
          
                                PADICHE (CONT'D)
                    We ain't askin' ya t'take us through,
                    soup t'nuts or 'nuthin' like that, I
                    jus' like t'hear the broad strokes,
                    y'know, so we can get an idea--
          
          Sykes and Watters look at one another, wordless exchange,
          then;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Pussy.
          
          Awkward beat, Padiche, head cocked, did I hear that right...?
          
                                PADICHE
                    Wha'?
          
                                SYKES
                    Pussy.
          
                                PADICHE
                        (leaning closer)
                    "Pushy?"
          
                                                                      26.
          
          Watters, shaking her head, correcting him.
          
                                   WATTERS
                    Pussy.
          
          The old man blanches, doesn't quite understand the--
          
                                   PADICHE
                    --Uh...
          
          Another beat. The girls let him dangle. Watters, lewd sneer,
          looks almost lustfully at Sykes as she says the following;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Israel likes pussy...
          
          Padiche, recovering, nodding, nervous.
          
                                PADICHE
                    ...Oh...uh-huh, yeah--
          
          Sykes squirms under Watters lascivious gaze, but manages:
          
                                SYKES
                    And we like that he likes...
          
          Yet another beat.    Padiche, wanting desperately to contribute.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Pussy?
          
                                   SYKES
                    Correct.
          
          Padiche, big nod going from one girl to the other, he-get's-
          it-but-not-really.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Fabulous.
          
          He extends his hand.   WE TRACK IT ACROSS IN C.U. as it meets
          with a male hand.

          Dupree and Deeks shaking hands with RUPERT "RIP" REED, mid-
          forties, showbiz-slash-mob attorney, low man on the totem at
          the Las Vegas based legal firm of "Culpepper Brody & Reed"
          
                                REED
                    Yeah, Jack, alright...hey--
                        (shakes Deeks' hand)
                    Nice t'meet you. Rip Reed.
          
                                   DEEKS
                    Pete.

                                REED
                    Okay, good, good, c'mon, c'min.
          
          Reed and Dupree shake.   Reed glances out in the hall before
          closing the door.
          
                                REED (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                        (to Dupree)
                    Where's your third? This was a
                    troika, no?
          
          Dupree, finding a seat, almost under his breath.
          
                                DUPREE
                    He's...fuckin'...he's comin'...
          
          As Elmore appears, Reed almost closes the door on him--
          
                                REED
                        (extending hand)
                    Hey, hey how r'ya, Rip Reed.
          
                                 ELMORE
                    Hollis.   Elmore.
          
          They shake. Dupree shoots a look at Elmore, not pleased.
          Elmore, pissy, leans against the wall, arms crossed.
          
          Reed, wound out, worn thin, half drunk-- his bedspread is
          papered with writs, summons, notaries, etc: Everything to
          make Buddy Israel's return to custody legally binding. He
          sits on the edge of the bed, reaching for a pack of smokes
          on the nightstand, finding a half empty glass of scotch.
          
                                REED
                        (to Deeks)
                    So Jack tells me you're both ex-cops?
          
                                DEEKS
                    Yeah, that's right.

                    What? Five, six years?
          
          Reed, digging a cigarette out of his pocket.
          
                                REED
                    Man the stories you guys must tell.
                    I grew up soft myself, private
                    schools, little blazers, you "Talked
                    it out" nobody threw punches, t'this

                    Pretty much a panty-waste, trembling
                    little faggot-fairy when I smell
                    trouble-- and I don't say this to be
                    self-deprecating, I just don't have
                    much of an opinion about myself, I
                    mean, shit, I wish I was a lot more
                    like you guys, barfighters, big
                    swinging dicks, gettin' it done.
                    Sadly.

                         exposes torso flab)
                    This is it. It's...disgusting.
                        (with a look skyward)

                    hereditary alcoholism! 'preciate it!
                        (beat, to Dupree)
                    Okay, I'm babbling, I do this when I
                    drink, forgive the rants, let's get
                    at it here. This wanted felon fucking
                    prick bastard Buddy Israel and the
                    nearly one million dollar bail bond.
          
          Dupree smiles, pats Reed on the shoulder, don't-sweat-this...
          
                                DUPREE
                    Rip, my right hand to God, we're
                    gonna go in and recover this asshole
                    and everybody's gonna leave the
                    theater grinning. Trust me.
          
                                REED
                    That confidence translates bro,
                    seriously, it does! Out-STANDING!
          
          Reed, white-boy high-five, excruciatingly un-hip. Deeks and
          Elmore literally have to look away. Dupree can barely bear

                    I'm a lawyer, y'know, I need to hear
                    these things, little boosts, helps
                    allay my fears, I pass that piece of
                    mind along to my partners.
                        (beat, then)
                    Alright, so, couple primers for you
                    guys, maybe things we might've looked
                    past that you should know about...His
                    hangers-on, these idiots Israel
                    runs with, they're all "packing heat"
                    "strapped" whatever the phrase is.
                    Point two, Israel likes hookers, so
                    you might run into a harem up there.
                    Point three: He binges between a six-
                    to-seven thousand dollar a day cocaine
                    habit that nobody knows about, so he
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                       29.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    and those hookers, will most likely
                    be high. He also drinks, self-
                    medicates, the whole cliche, y'know?
                    The strung out hasbeen jerkoff snitch
                    drunk. The seven-layer loser.
                        (beat, exhales)
                    I'm praying he puts up a fight,
                    please, please, please, rape him if
                    possible, I'll-pay-the-extra-whatever--
          
          Nobody knows what to make of Reed, as he giggles, nods,
          smokes, nods, drinks-- he looks at all of them, a sudden
          unexpected wave of enthusiasm seizing him.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    Yeah-yeah-yeah. Fucking hell, this
                    feels GREAT! YEAH!? DOESN'T IT!
          
          Reed begins laughing like a complete fucking loon, like he's
          just lost it completely. It's paralyzingly uncomfortable.
          Then, just like that, he stops, grabs an envelope.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                        (hands envelope over)
                    Okay, we had a retainer, for services
                    to be rendered...Fifty thousand
                    dollars.
          
          Reed hands the envelope to a smiling Dupree.

          Israel, furious, screaming at an immense black man standing
          in front of him: SIR IVY, his steadfast second-in-command:
          The presence of a Pimp, the mien of a Mack.
          
                                 SIR IVY
                    Calm down.
          
          Israel gets up in Ivy's grill. A phone begins to ring.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Don't tell me to "calm down" Ivy! I

                    HUGO GRAB THAT! I JUST PAGED GILL!
          
          Hugo rushes for the phone.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    Look at the attention we're getting.
                    It's all bad...
          
                                                                    30.
          
          Hugo, hand cupped over the phone, butting in.

                    Hey-- It's him, it's Gill.

                    was gonna happen?
          
          Israel, walks toward Hugo.
          
                                ISRAEL

                                SIR IVY
                    We're hot, and they're losing a whole
                    floor's worth of business saying
                    it's "under construction."
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling
                    out that kinda bread for this
                    shithole, this is a junior suite in
                    Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he
                    should have his cell on, I need an
                    update.
                        (to Hugo)
                    Get the Russian up here, have him
                    clean this place, floor to ceiling
                    and get us packed .
                        (points to hookers)
                    ...And send out for some new skeeze,
                    the sun's up, these ones are starting
                    to stink...
          
          Hug hands the phone to Israel, pulling his own cell, dialing.
          Ivy looks around at the collapsed hookers, strewn about the
          place, his face registering the appropriate disgust. Then:
          
                                SIR IVY
                    BEANIE!
          
          Some of the girls start at the sound of Ivy's big Barry White
          baritone. They rise, groggy, burping up last night's
          debauchery. Mascara-smeared, hangover-hindered the girls
          rise as BERNARD "BEANIE" ALFONSE, protector #2, pops in; A
          sumo-sized brother with a diamond-studded smile.
          
                                BEANIE
                        (addressing the girls)
                    Alright ya'll, that's the call, we
                    had our fun, pack it in, pro-ceed to
                    the front. Les' go, les' go--

          Beanie starts herding hookers, Ivy positions himself at the
          door, pulls a flashroll, fingers hundred dollar bills.
          Israel, phone to his ear, retires to the bedroom for privacy.

                      About cocaine...and the amount you're

                                  ISRAEL
                      I'm not doing cocaine.

                      They concluded, as I have, that you
                      are showing signs of severe cardiac
                      distress...so much so, that a massive

          Ivy and Beanie, marshalling the mass hooker exodus. Ivy
          paying the gals as they exit the suite. One YOUNG HOOKER
          bringing up the rear, stumbles in her stripper heels, shaky,
          tries to take another step, slips, trips, falls-- smacks
          face first into a glass coffee table, shattering it.
          
                                BEANIE (CONTD)
                    Damn girl, look out now!
          
          The other Hookers; gape jawed, mild shock, mild amusement.
          Beanie plucks the fallen woman up, shakes her off, straightens
          her out, pulls off the offending heels.

                    Buddy, nobody knows about your
                    condition, or your drug use. Why
                    you lied to me, knowing that I'd
                    find out anyway, I'll never know,
                    but it imperative now that I see

                    That's not possible. I told you.
          
                                 DR. GILL
                    There are certain meds, certain
                    intravenous measures that can
                    counteract some of the damage you've
                    done, but I'd have to administer
                    them myself.

                       No. Sorry comes later, when you're
                       in a partial coma with ambulatory
                       paralysis. Sorry comes when we have

          fake nails into skin, snapping them off, Van Helsing style.
          
          The fur flies, a slugfest free-for-all. Ivy intervenes--
          Beanie jumps into the fray, separating combatants-- one of

          them wielding her pump heel like a pick-axe. Hugo heads
          another off hooker, hitting her like a blitzing linebacker.
          
          Israel, who has walked back out, looks on with total disdain
          for what he's seeing...Then, he catches his reflection in a
          living room mirror, a profound sense of sadness there.

          In the distance, on the lake, a small boat, a man sitting
          inside, gazing up through a pair of binoculars.

          INT. "TAHOE SKILLET" RESTAURANT -- MORNING
          
          The Feds occupy a booth, black coffee for both. Carruthers
          clicks off a cellphone. Messner is engrossed in a file
          clipped with old surveillance photographs of Primo Sparazza.
          
                                CARRUTHERS

                    Penthouse level. There was apparently
                    a fisticuffs with some prostitutes.
                    He wasn't involved. He's also had
                    his people phone a local madame for
                    another group of girls.
          
                                MESSNER
                    No rest for the wicked.
                        (beat, holds up file)
                    Why were we never shown these files?
                    We're sitting on Sparazza for what?
                    Six months now and we're just seeing
                    this?

          Messner, turning the file toward Carruthers, pointing.

                    Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody
                    shares information anymore, it's
                    become synonymous with job security.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Based on what we had, I thought
                    Sparazza was a mid-level player at
                    best and it turns out he's this mob
                    relic, running the show out west.
          
          Carruthers nods, sips his coffee.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    He's stayed below the radar. You
                    don't kill a hundred and thirty people
                    without knowing how to tip-toe.
          
          Messner flips the file, finds a page paper-clipped with a
          photograph of murder/martyred Federal Agent Freeman Heller.
          
                                MESSNER
                    But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed
                    Heller. Why not go after him, guns
                    blazing' for that one?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Heller was buried in agency lore,
                    anytime an operative failed or was
                    perceived to have failed, Hoover
                    blackballed their memory. Look at
                    Ness.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Yeah, but the Untouchables took down
                    Capone. Heller got shot and killed.
                    The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza
                    walked.
          
          Messner sits back, kills the remainder of his coffee, gazing
          out the window, watching sightseers stream by. Carruthers
          glances at his watch.
          
                                                                      36.

                    It's almost five a.m. in D.C. now.
                    Locke said the lawyers from Justice
                    had been in there since three o'clock
                    yesterday afternoon. Israel's manager
                    is acting as his attorney and that's
                    what's holding things up.
          
          The waitress arrives with breakfast, sets it down.
          
                                MESSNER
                    So he has no idea what's about to
                    happen?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    No. And I want to be in that room a
                    half second after Mecklen calls to
                    say the deal's done. We've got a
                    sheriff's task force on stand-by.
          
                                MESSNER
                    What about the hotel staff obstructing
                    us. Israel's obviously paid off the
                    management.

                    Tampering with a witness extraction
                    of this magnitude makes everyone
                    indictable at the federal level.
                        (beat, grins)
                    Trust me, we won't any problems with
                    the hotel staff. You show 'em your

                    caps and it's instant compliance.

          A pimply CASINO EMPLOYEE nods, dashing off to find the boss.
          Acosta glances around, takes in the eight-dollar-an-hour
          security, the array of quasi-armed guards...and smiles.

          Guard uniforms, exactly like those we've just seen, worn by
          the Nomad's security staff. Maroon with burnished gold
          buttons and brown piping down the slacks. Three separate
          vestments laid out across the trunk of a rental car.

          Dupree and Deeks in an empty parking lot, bundled up in
          windbreakers, battling the frozen spindrift swirling in off
          the lake.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Same place that rents the guard's
                    uniforms. There's a shift change at
                    9am. Graveyard goes home and we can
                    blend in with the day shift coming
                    on.
          
                                DEEKS
                    What about access cards? Pass keys?

          Deeks bangs on the hood of the car.

          Elmore leans against the bumper, bored.

                    Yeah, we've been through that.

                    Then quit acting like somebody shit

                    Two security levels, the one we're
                    going in under the guise of, hotel
                    security, has restricted access.
                    They're mostly there to monitor the
                    lobby, handle disturbances on the
                    different floors and toss out drunks.
                        (beat)
                    There's a thirty-five member employee
                    rotation going from graveyard to day
                    shift. If we split up, we can blend
                    in and enter unnoticed. Once we're
                    inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
          
                                  ELMORE
                    Then what--
          
          --A Plymouth Barracuda passes by, brakes hard, reverses.
          The trio stop talking, look over...and then their lives end.
          Bad intentions blaze from the driver's side, machine-gun
          bursts-- Dupree is hit flush, dead on his feet, his dying
          thought, cut comically short; "I had that car in high scho--
          
          Deeks, shredded where he stands, his body absorbing a
          fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound.
          One creases Elmore's skull, another blows out Deeks' back,
          fragmenting, claiming three fingers from Elmore's left hand.
          The three of them fall in weird, waterlogged flops, no dying
          breaths, no death rattles, just lights out...just like that.
          
          Several seconds pass. Then the car door opens and The Tremor
          Brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun
          and reefer smoke. LESTER TREMOR, the dandruff-caked,
          pockmarked middle brother is the first out. He shakes off
          the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          The Tremors' youngest brother, the Baby-Huey sized JEEVES
          TREMOR bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. He unzips & rips,
          baptizing the Cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss.
          DARWIN TREMOR climbs from the car, the eldest brother, straw
          boss, brains of the outfit. He looks down at the dead men,
          seems saddened by their state. Some remorse maybe? Maybe so.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                        (still pissing)
                    Luvin' that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean
                    as a nun's snatch on Kristal Nacht!
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                        (stops singing)
                    Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't
                    vacated yet, s'keep quiet.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    Them spirts can kiss my Chinese ass.
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                    ...YOU AIN'T NO CHINESE!
          
          This exchange prompts Jeeves to turn and urinate on Lester.
          Lester squeals war cry, launching a wild windmill barrage on
          his behemoth little brother. Jeeves ignores the hydrant-
          like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back.
          
          Darwin kneels down over the dead Jack Dupree, taking Jack's
          face in his hand and squeezing back and forth, adding his
          own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist act.
          
                                DUPREE (DEAD)
                    ...I forgive you Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Shoot, I appreciate that man.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    If I needed your I.D. and your car
                    and me and my brothers were wanted
                    by the law, I woulda killed you to
                    get 'em too.
          
                                  DARWIN TREMOR
                    You woulda?
          
                                DUPREE
                    Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong
                    place at the wrong time. So don't
                    feel so bad dude.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn...alright then.
          
                                DUPREE
                    I don't mind now anyway.
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                      40.
          
                                DUPREE (CONT'D)
                    You know, up here in Heaven, it's
                    beautiful. Way better than fuckin'
                    Hawaii or any place like that.
          
          Darwin's eyes begin to well, the tears coming slowly. In the
          background, Lester and Jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly.
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Really?
          
                                DUPREE
                    I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm
                    gonna get laid by some fine ass angels
                    and then go hang out with Jesus and
                    them.
          
          Darwin wipes his eyes.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Man, that's great.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    I got it made in the shade Amigo.
                    Hey, I'll see you up here some day,
                    don't worry.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    You think so?
          
          Darwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as
          though Dupree we're smiling up at him.
          
                                   DUPREE
                    I know so.
          
          Darwin smiles back down   at the corpse, wiping his nose on
          his sleeve. He reaches    down and pulls out Dupree's wallet.
          He spots the bondsman's   license, eyeballs the bail papers:
          He sees the name ROBERT   ISRAEL in bold type. Puts it together.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn Jack...you was after the same
                    sacka shit as us...Small world.
          
          Darwin continues the pat down, pauses, pulls the envelope
          with fifty grand inside, fingers fresh bills. With his free
          hand he manipulates Dupree's dead mouth one last time.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Don't tell your asshole brothers you
                    know about it, that money is for you
                    old boy.
          
          Darwin, a nod of acknowledgement for the dead Dupree.
          
                                                                      41.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I appreciate that pard...I wish I
                    coulda been a better friend.
          
          Darwin stands, His eyes move to the guard's uniforms, still
          laid out across the trunk...he looks over at his two brothers,
          Jeeves now with a Lenny-like hammerlock on Lester's head.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Alright enough grabassin' goddamit!
                    We need t'get over t'that hotel.
          
                                WATTERS (V.O.)
                    We're already here baby.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY -- MORNING
          
          Watters is once again on her cellphone to Lorenzo.
          
                                WYMAN (O.S.)
                        (on the phone)
                    So everything's cool then?
          
                                WATTERS
                    We sat down with Padiche, he tried
                    to get some details which we wasn't
                    gonna give up, but it's all good.
                    We goin' check Sis in first, 'fore I
                    check in across the street.
          
          Sykes arrives at the reception counter when the elevators
          open-- and Israel's Hookers, post-brawl bruised, bloodied
          and barefoot, come staggering out.
          
          They slur insults at the security team, broken heels slung
          over their shoulders, wigs misaligned, miniskirts mangled.
          Sykes trades looks with Watters as if assessing something,
          nodding almost imperceptibly to one another. Watters then
          winks, something sexual there...it gives Sykes the shivers.
          
          The Hookers are surrounded by a horde of hotel staff and
          summarily whisked away. Watters joins Sykes. The WOMAN
          behind the counter checking Sykes in, looks up to see Watters.
          
                                 WOMAN
                    Will you be needing a room with two
                    double beds?
          
                                SYKES
                        (quickly)
                    No, we're not together.
          
          Watters, a grin.
          
                                WATTERS
                    C'mon baby, don't be shy.

                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (to woman)
                    Just one bed please.
                        (beat, to Sykes smiling)
                    Although if we sweat that one up, we
                    goin' need some clean sheets.
                        (As Sykes pulls away)
                    C'mon Girl, you know I'm playing!
          
          Sykes looks uneasily at the counter woman, who keeps her
          eyes locked on the computer in front of her.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (over her shoulder to
                         the departing hookers)
                    ..If ya'll let hoochie like that
                    stay up in here, ya'll must be burning
                    sheets by the ton.
          
          The woman just smiles that monstrously insincere "I'm here
          to help!" smile, offering nothing in response.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    You just goin' grin? Y'ain't goin
                    comment on that, at all? Trampy ass
                    skeezers, doin' damage they ain't
                    even smart enough to see. That don't
                    gall you at all?
                        (beat, closer)
                    Bitches like those are the same ones
                    runnin' feminism right to the brink
                    girl. Bitches like that the reason
                    mafuckas don't take our species
                    seriously. We jus' meat for male
                    consumption, we jus' pieces a'ass
                    and pussy, somethin' pretty in
                    lipstick and eye liner can suck cock.
          
          Sykes, embarrassed, nudging Watters, knock-it-off...
          
                                WATTERS (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bitches like that make me weep for
                    what could be-- if we could all,
                    sisters everywhere, black, white,
                    yellow and brown, put our shit down
                    one time, unified front, the force
                    of the female race, mobilized, moving
                    as one...
          
          The woman, smile severely strained, the pro-feminist diatribe
          falling on decidedly deaf ears. An awkward beat, then;
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm gonna need a mini-bar key too.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                       43.
          
          A mini-bar being opened. A hand reaching in, extracting two
          small bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey and a bottle of seltzer.
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL ROOM -- LOWER FLOOR
          
          The figure crosses the room, pouring the seltzer onto a towel.
          He kneels down, dabbing a spot on the carpet, fresh spill,
          deep red, indelible.. The seltzer doesn't bring it up. The
          stain remains, smeared now but unmistakable...blood.
          
          The figure stands. In the bathroom behind him, we see a body,
          male, late-50's, trussed up, hung by his feet over the tub
          and bled out. The figure walks in, takes a Polaroid, turns
          it upside down near the man's face and fires off a photo.
          
          He crosses back into the bedroom. The resulting photo is
          tucked into the corner of a dresser mirror as it develops.
          As the figure sits, WE PAN OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          LAZLO SOOT: world class assassin slash master of disguise.
          The slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we
          now see in the mirror. Soot touches up the putty and plastic
          appliances on his face, smoothing, sealing...
          
          He takes up a small micro-cassette recorder, rewinds, pushes
          play. A butler's uniform, steamed and pressed, hangs on the
          door. He takes it down and begins changing into it.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    --Keep calm.
          
          He glances over at the bed. The dead man's voice crackles
          back over the recorder.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    I am an employee, I-- I don't know
                    wh-- they don't let me speak to h--
          
                                LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    --Say your name. Then say "How can I
                    be of assistance."
          
          Soot, back to the mirror, buttoning his collar, straightening
          his cuffs, smoothing out the creases.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    I don't understand.
          
                                 LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    I didn't ask for your understanding.
                    I asked you to say your name, followed
                    by the phrase "How can I be of
                    assistance."
          
          Beat. Soot looks down at the Silencer-fitted 9mm pistol lying
          on the vanity.
          
                                                                         44.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)   (CONT'D)
                    Last chance.
          
          A pause, then:
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    Thank you.
          
          A muffled gunshot sounds. The recorder abruptly shuts off.
          Soot, gazing at his reflection now, rewinds the recorder,
          replays, listens, gauging the man's vocal patterns-- rough
          Baltic accent, throaty warble, excessive smoke & booze
          exposure, tracheal damage. Tough to match. He rehearses one.
          
                                SOOT
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
          He grimaces, grabs cigarettes off the bureau, lights, wails

          He grabs an aerosol can from the same bureau, strafes the
          back of his throat, pops the tops on the bottles of Jack,
          kills them both, gags, sputters, recovers, adjusts himself.
          Suddenly, the phone begins to ring. Soot stops, stares.
          
          After another ring, he lifts the receiver,

                    assistance.
          
          Hugo Croop's voice booms from the earpiece.

          Israel, sequestered to his bedroom, lying on a baby-grand
          piano, its legs inexplicably sawed off during the previous
          night's hedonism. In his hands, the de riguer deck of cards,
          restlessly shuffled and reshuffled...Cocaine has been lovingly
          cut and arranged in neat, snortable rows atop the piano.
          
          In the b.g. we see HUGO on the phone to Vitoli/Soot.

                    hours and in so doing, have stared
                    into the face of hell. These are the

                        (to Bill)
                    Can I speak to you privately?
          
          The Supervisor nods, dismisses his staff, calls after one.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Gary, let's get our personnel up in
                    the catwalk over twelve, that stickman
                    has been acting odd and I don't like
                    the rolls that table has been getting.
          
                                  EMPLOYEE
                    Got it.
          
          Acosta waits for the door to close, leaving only himself and
          the supervisor in the room.

                    It's gotta be tough keeping an eye

                    it's a chore.
          
          Acosta laughs, keeps it loose.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So, Bill, if I understand this right,
                    you currently have your penthouse
                    floor under construction?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    That's correct.

                        (points to monitors)
                    But with these down, doesn't that
                    pose a major security concern if, as
                    you say, you have to keep an eye on
                    everything at all times?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Well, we were worried about dust and
                    debris from the work being done
                    ruining the cameras, so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    --so you shut them off?
          
          The Supervisor, quick to amend.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Yes, but no-- we have personnel
                    stationed at both ends of that hall,
                    twenty-four hours a day.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    What kind of personnel?

                    Uh-- well, yes, uh just in terms of
                    the men up there now, my team, he's
                    serving lunch and dinner and just
                    doing general upkeep so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So there are no guests staying on
                    that floor?
          
          The Supervisor makes a big show of the headshake "no...."

                    No. None at present.

                    integrity, due to the roof access.

                    Is your security team armed?
          
                                 SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Of course.   Yes.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    And who has access to that floor?
          
          The Supervisor...something like suspicion in his eyes. The
          secure "hotline" begins to ring. The Supervisor looks over
          at the phone, then back at Acosta...the unflappable pro.
          
                                                                       50.
          
                                ACOSTA (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bill, listen, I can ask you now and
                    you can answer me, or I can drag you
                    up to San Francisco and depose you
                    in front of a federal judge. Because
                    that's where we're headed here.
          
          Bullshit, but it sounds good.   The Supervisor starts for the
          ringing hotline.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to
                    see your identification again. We're
                    covering some sensitive material
                    here and I need to safeguard myself,
                    I'm sure you can understand.
          
          Acosta, reaching into his coat.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Of course, but if you could just
                    tell me who has access to that floor--
          
          The Supervisor touches a pass key that he wears on a chain
          around his neck as he moves to answer the phone.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    --I hold the sole pass key and
                    personally relieve the shifts myself.
                    Now if I could get your ID we can--
          
          --Acosta, coming out of his coat, fake ID in hand, the
          supervisor reaching for it and the ringing phone
          simultaneously-- suddenly a six-inch, spring-loaded stiletto
          blade explodes from Acosta's sleeve, piercing the ID-- pinning
          it to the Supervisor's chest.
          
          A surprised grunt from the man as blood begins to pour from
          his punctured sternum. The blade retracts. The phone sits
          trembling in the Supervisor's hand, --a voice-- Carruther's,
          tinny and barely audible, warbles from the other end-
          
                                VOICE
                        (over phone)
                    Hello? This is Special Agent Donald
                    Carruthers of the FBI, I need an--
          
          Acosta takes the phone from the stunned Supervisor, replacing
          it on the console. The Supervisor, still confused by the
          exchange, wanting to speak, but unsure of what to say...He
          gazes down to the red blossom fanning across his shirt front.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Is...that...blood?
          
          Acosta pockets his ID as he yanks the pass key off the
          Supervisor's neck. His natural accent returns.
          
                                                                     51.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Yes it is and right now it's filling
                    your lungs. In less than a minute,
                    you'll asphyxiate and pass out. You
                    shouldn't be feeling any pain now.
          
          The Supervisor's knees begin to buckle, nervous system slowly
          shutting down. Acosta steadies him, easing him to the floor.
          
                                  ACOSTA (CONT'D)
                    Close your   eyes. Think of something
                    wonderful.    Don't make this face the
                    last thing   you ever see.
                        (beat,   in Spanish)
                    Heaven may   hold it against you.
          
          The Supervisor, unblinking, an almost childlike clarity there.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    ...Am I really dying...?
          
          Acosta, deadpan.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Bill--
                        (out of respect)
                    Willliam...
                        (pause)
                    We're all dying...
          
          Bill the supervisor almost smiles as he breathes his last
          breath...Acosta checks for a pulse, then drags his body toward
          a service closet. As he passes one of the video monitors...
          
          ...WE SEE ON-SCREEN: The Employee entrance, grave and swing
          shifts on their way out, day shift on it's way in. Mixed in
          with this personnel rotation, each doing his inconspicuous
          best...The Brothers Tremor.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE -- DAY
          
          Darwin, Lester and Jeeves, clad in full security attire,
          standing apart so as not to appear together, heads down,
          hands shoved into their pockets.
          
          Darwin bird-dogs both his brothers, monitoring their movement,
          using hand signals and some bizarre inbred semaphore to
          communicate with them. They pass through and punch in,
          signing time sheets. The surrounding security staff oblivious
          to the new faces. The brothers enter the lower floors, moving
          through the hotel's fitness center and indoor pool.
          
          A kid does a cannonball as they pass as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          A clouded bog-- coming to-- consciousness, then, retching,
          gagged gasps, throat ablaze with bile, liquid clearing
          convulsed lungs, breath in burning spasms-- not enough air.
          
          EXT. LAKE --DAY
          
          Elmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a
          start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a
          deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints,
          bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much.
          
          He gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia
          turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three
          digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he
          stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he
          doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of
          his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the
          concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind.
          
          He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He
          reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He
          turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down,
          the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them...
          
                                MESSNER (V.O.)
                    Double homicide, gunshot vics, both
                    of 'em dumped in the lake. That's
                    where the Sheriff's task force is.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. CAR -- DAY
          
          Carruthers and Messner, hectic, speeding through the south
          shore of Lake Tahoe, cellphones pinned to their ears.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (back into his phone)
                    Deputy, have you made any ID's?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                        (cups phone, to Messner)
                    Get a coroner's estimate too.
                        (back into his cell)
                    --Miss, I've been transferred and I
                    was disconnected. No one is answering
                    and I need someone from security to
                    pick up that line. It's urgent.
          
          Messner, nodding as he listens.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Dep-- Deputy, I'm going to put you
                    on speaker, I have Agent Carruthers
                    in the car with me.
                        (beat to Carruthers)
                    You need to hear this.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          Messner clicks over, the deputies voice fills the car.
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY
                    --nd have a pending ID on a Jack
                    Dupree, appears to be a bondsman out
                    of Las Vegas. He was just rolled
                    and printed by our medical examiner.
          
          Messner and Carruthers trade looks.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Was there anything recovered?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    We found a handwritten receipt in
                    his pocket for what looks like uniform
                    rentals. The name and phone number
                    of the rental house wasn't listed,
          
                                MESSNER
                    What kind of uniforms?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    Receipt wasn't specific, the uniforms
                    were just listed as maroon in color.
          
          Carruthers mashes the floorboard, brakes smoke, power swerve,
          slicing the rented Taurus across four lanes of traffic.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Alright, deputy, we'll be there as
                    soon as possible, until we arrive, I
                    need you to limit physical access
                    and restrict movement to and from
                    the crime scene. Clear?
          
          Messner clicks off.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maroon uniforms?
          
                                MESSNER
                    Yeah. Have you been able to get
                    through to the Nomad's security?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    No.
                        (beat, decision)
                    I'm going over there. You take the
                    car from there, get out to the lake.
          
          Carruthers pushes 110mph, barreling toward the Nomad, blowing
          through traffic-- Both men pull out IFB/earpiece apparatus,
          plugging in, checking their signals.
          
                                MESSNER
                    You going up to the Penthouse alone?
          
                                                                    54.
          
          Carruthers pulls a .45 from his holster, driving with his
          knees now, he jacks the slide, checks for a chambered round.
          
                                 CARRUTHERS
                    Yeah.
          
          The slide releases--
          
                                SYKES (V.O.)
                    That's a bad move.

          Sykes, stowing a Glock 9mm, tweaking the earpiece/mic combo
          she's wearing-- getting primped, leather mini-skirt, lace
          garters, thigh-high platform boots; hooker de coutage.
          
                                 WATTERS (O.S.)
                    Why?

                    'Cuz we don't need to draw any more

                    feedback off that earpiece--
          
          Sykes pulls her earpiece, adjusts something, re-inserts it.
          
                                 SYKES
                    Better?

          The Hotel just across the street from the Nomad. Watters on
          a headset, talking to Sykes, looking out the window.
          
                                 WATTERS
                    Much.
          
          On a room service tray near Watters; scanners monitor calls
          and in-house transmissions within The Nomad.

                    What are you hearin' right now?
          
          Watters adjusts one of the scanners, searching for a signal.
          
                                                                       55.

                    about a fed being in the building.

                    It's just a little casino inspection,
                    don't trip, he's alone.

                    Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
          
          Sykes checks her reflection, makes sure her holsters aren't
          peeking out, weapons adequately conformed to her curves.
          
                                SYKES
                    When them tricks hit the lobby, holla
                    at me and I'm gonna meet them on the
                    way up, blend in. Once I get inside,
                    I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head
                    and back out hot. Anybody's fucks
                    with that program, y'break 'em off.
                    They get gully--
          
                                WATTERS
                    I'mma grip and rip girl.
                        (holding up a red-
                         tipped bullet)
                    I got some handloads here ready to
                    cut heads.
          
                                SYKES
                    Jus' remember, this is more rescuin'
                    shit than rampagin' shit...What are
                    you shootin'?
          
                                WATTERS
                    ...Girl, y'know I had to bring big
                    mamma through.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          A .50 Caliber sniper-rifle on a tri-pod, jutting just past
          the window, zeroed ut on the Penthouse level of the Nomad.
          
                                SYKES
                    You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin'
                    t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the
                    moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna
                    get that grimy?
          
                                WATTERS
                    The try t'wild out on my boo and
                    it's on and crackin'! I'm layin'
                    niggas out.
          
                                                                    56.
          
                                SYKES
                    Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I
                    wish they made this more sheer.
          
          Watters puts her eye to the scope, scans, finds SYKES in
          the crosshairs across the way, adjusting her outfit. Watters
          settles on her, watches...something vaguely creepy about
          this bit of voyeurism. She nuzzles the Barrett close.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Mmmm. I tell you, I snuggle up with
                    big girl here and my pussy start
                    t'drip.
          
          Sykes grimaces.    Watters sees it, smiles to herself.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    ...So you heard from Keith? He still
                    fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned
                    girl?
          
                                SYKES
                    I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for
                    that sorry ass nigga.
          
                                WATTERS
                    He a dog babydoll. He a great dane.
                    I tried to tell y'after ya'll first
                    date. He hit that ass one time, his
                    interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
          
                                SYKES
                    You know I burned all his shit. All
                    that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic,
                    I burned his turntables too. They
                    was like three-thousand brand new.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on
                    some other scrub. We got one another,
                    s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
          
          Sykes says nothing for a moment, Watters just watches her
          through the crosshairs, her finger idly flicking the trigger
          in a strangely perverse gesture. Finally:
          
                                SYKES
                    Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I
                    want you t'tell me straight up, since
                    I got my suspicions and y'know I
                    ain't one t'talk circles...you gay?
          
                                  WATTERS
                    What!?
          
                                SYKES
                    Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
          
                                                                        57.
          
                                 WATTERS
                    Damn!   Why you trippin' like that?
          
                                SYKES
                    --I don't know, I feel like you always
                    pushin' up on me, gettin' close and
                    I love you baby, in every way you
                    can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
          
                                WATTERS
                    I ain't even goin' dignify that.
                    You my road dog. We threw up sets.
                        (beat, lets it sit)
                    Plus you stank.
          
                                SYKES
                        (laughing now)
                    Fuck you.
          
          Watters spots something outside, grabs a pair of binoculars,
          looks down...BINOCULARS P.O.V.: Four obvious CALL GIRLS
          disembarking a taxi, mylar-colored micro-minis, fuck-me heels,
          cheap shoulder bags. They smoke, laugh, chit-chat.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Alright girl, the ho train has
                    arrived. Four of 'em.
          
          Sykes, grabbing her bag, dropping spare clips inside and
          starting for the door.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...I'm on my way out, I'm just gonna
                    hang in the hallway until they start
                    up in the elevators.
          
          Watters loads a red-tipped round into the breach of the Fifty.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Just get in there and do your thing
                    baby...mamma gots you.
          
          SNAP ZOOM ON BULLET as she slams the action forward, loading
          the round WE SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
          
          ...Dial tones over black.   A phone rings. A voice answers.
          
          FADE UP ON:
          
          A reel-to-reel machine activates, begins to record-- A sticker
          on the pick-up spool reads: "PROPERTY OF THE F.B.I."
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          MONTAGE
          
          The players take their places. Over these images WE HEAR:
          
                                                                    58.

                    Buzzy...Buzz...?
          
                                  PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Yeah...Sid?
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Right, you got clicks, anything?
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Nah, nuthin' on my end--
          
          Vitoli, aka Lazlo Soot: arriving at the Penthouse level,
          exchanging nods with the security team, pushing his service
          cart out of the elevator and down the hall, through a metal
          detector, which goes off. Vitoli/Soot shrugs, gestures to
          his stainless steel cart. The security team wave him through.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    So how we lookin'?
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Good. This thing's on track, looks
                    like it's gonna get done.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the
                    scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it
                    from 'em then huh?
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
          
          Pasquale Acosta: Now wearing the nametag of "Bill" the
          recently deceased Security Supervisor. He buttons his red
          blazer, hanging the penthouse pass key around his neck as he
          moves through the lobby, carrying a small briefcase.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    That's what we're countin' on. What'd
                    they say when you went for specifics?
          
          The Tremor Brothers: Duffel bags straining with the horrible,
          shit inside. They move toward a service elevator, swapping
          pill bottles, downing overdose amounts, repeating "Mein Kampf"
          recitations as they push the elevator's call button.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share
                    trade secrets, that type'a thing.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Okay-- yeah, I can, I respect that.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    How are we on time...?
          
                                                                     59.
          
          Hollis Elmore: Frantically ringing the alley delivery doorbell
          of a local Souvenir Shop-- naked, frozen, delirious, near-
          death, he has dragged himself there.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been
                    dispatched, he's flying so--
          
                                PADICHE
                    Well, uh-- damn, alright, so he's
                    headed in, does that-- where does
                    that leave us?
          
          Agent Messner: Watching as the bodies of Dupree and Deeks
          are hauled from the lake by Sheriff's personnel. He walks
          the shoreline, searching for clues, on his cellphone, trying
          to reach Security at the Nomad.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    --in a foot race right now. Really
                    a matter of who out hustles who,
                    y'know...
          
          Agent Carruthers: Plugging in his headset as he reaches the
          front of the Nomad, leaping out, rushing inside, holstering
          his gun for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    So we gotta get t'Israel pretty quick
                    for this to fly, yeah? I think?
          
          Georgia Sykes; Pulling a small revolver from her garter-
          holster, annoyed, rubbing the chaffed area, reaching the
          elevator, leaning back against the wall, waiting.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Basically-- it'd really be the best
                    thing right now, yeah. Can't give
                    up the ship now Buzzy--
          
          Sharice Watters; Her eye going to the rifle-scope...she makes
          subtle adjustments to the targeting-ring-- P.O.V. -- Israel's
          penthouse sits in the crosshairs. We see a figure, just
          beyond the glass...a shimmering shape, moving within.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    --No, no, not when y'can see the
                    shore. I hear ya.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Okay, well, y'know, then we just
                    gotta get Israel.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)
                    I'm working on it.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Bag this fucker Buzzy.
          
                                                                      60.
          
                                  PADICHE (V.O.)
                      It's gettin' done Sid.
          
          Watters tracks the figure-- finger finding the trigger as we
          SMASH CUT TO:
          
          BLACK
          
          FADE UP ON:
          
          CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON -- Primo Sparazza, bedridden, blinking
          at the nothingness around him...a life on its last legs...a
          dying man determined to outlive his last enemy...Buddy Israel.
          
                                                                FADE OUT:
          
          FADE IN UP ON:
          
          FBI   Director Locke, receiving a CONFIDENTIAL package, signing
          for   it, tearing it open, reviewing the paperwork inside.
          The   color drains from his face, casting him cadaver-like.
          His   phone rings, he quickly snatches up the receiver.
          
                                  LOCKE
                      ...Yes? Yes sir...I'm looking at it
                      now...what does this-- mean exactly?
                          (long pause)
                      ...What?
                          (longer pause)
                      ...Good God...
                          (back down at paperwork)

          Ivy, his menace gone malignant, quietly stepping out of the
          shadows...Israel has no idea that he's been there all along.

                                IVY
                    So what'd Mecklen have to say?

          turns the burners slow.

          Israel almost chokes on his own smile, nodding.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    So we're all traveling together,

          Israel starts zipping up some of his bags.

          Ivy unbuttons his coat. A .50 Cal rides in his shoulder-rig.
          Israel averts his eyes. Ivy lets the moment load up...then;
          
                                SIR IVY

          Israel, unnerved now-- spots a small handgun sticking out of
          his bag. He covers it with the bedspread, looking up at Ivy.

          Carruthers breaks off, moving for the man in the maroon jacket
          heading toward the elevator. He reaches him, puts a hand on
          his shoulder.

          Acosta has fully assumed the identity of the murdered security
          supervisor. The pimply kid at counter eyeballs him, confused.
          Acosta steps behind Carruthers, blocking himself from view.

          up her back. She holds a moment. Doesn't board.

          Sykes waits a beat, then reaches for the call button to signal
          another car. WE FOLLOW HER FINGER to the "up" button and--

                    No, no clarify. What is "an emergency
                    requisition of surrounding personnel?"
                        (beat, listens)
                    Within one-hundred mile radius,
                    understood-- Sacramento, Reno, Carson
                    City. So in less than an hour, we're
                    going to have anywhere from forty to
                    fifty odd field agents arriving,
                    without the slightest inkling as to
                    why they're here. Is that correct?
                    Am I misinterpreting that or--
                        (listens)
                    No, I'm not blaming any one person,
                    this is Bureau directive. But Agent
                    Carruthers is the SAC and he's out
                    of cell range at the moment, so I
                    can't contact him to--
                        (listens, frustrated)
                    Very well. I need to get Deputy
                    Director Locke on the phone as soon
                    as possible.
          
          One of the Crime Scene Recovery TEAM MEMBERS approaches,
          hands Messner a printout. A faxed, blown up rendering of a
          Nevada Driver's license...We recognize the face.
          
                                  MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    Who's this?
          
                                CS TEAM MEMBER
                    Hollis Elmore, resident of Las Vegas,
                    formerly with the P.D. there. He's a
                    known associate of Dupree's.
          
          The CS Team Member holds an evidence bag aloft.
          
                                CS TEAM MEMBER (CONT'D)
                    We found these washed up on shore.
          
          Messner takes the bag, gawks, can't quite make out the
          contents.
          
                                MESSNER
                    What are these?
          
                                CS TEAM MEMBER
                    Elmore's fingers. Whorls are in bad
                    shape from the frostbite, but we got
                    a good pull for latents, positive
                    ID.
                        (beat, nod to bag)
                    Those were shot off.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Then we've got a third man missing.
          
                                                                       67.

                                TASK FORCE CHIEF
                    We've recovered their car.
          
                                MESSNER
                    What car?
          
                                TASK FORCE CHIEF
                    Dupree's rental. A Dodge Stratus--
                    Picked up yesterday at a commuter
                    airport in Reno, Nevada.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (suddenly panicked)
                    --Where's it at now?
          
                                TASK FORCE CHIEF
                    In the parking structure of the Nomad.

          A crime scene unit already has the area cordoned off. Police
          photographers circle the rental car snapping pictures as
          uniformed units scribble license plate and VIN numbers.
          
          CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          A limo arrives, the Swede disembarks, black valise in tow.
          A group of Sparazza henchmen surround him, spiriting him
          toward a nearby stairwell, anxious to avoid the police.
          
          CAM CONTINUES PAN TO REVEAL:
          
          Doc Gill and Hugo, sitting in their car, a little leery at
          the heavy police presence. Hugo takes up his cellphone.
          
                                HUGO
                    Doc, I'm gonna tell 'em we're on our
                    way up, make sure it's cool up there.
                    Is there anything you need?
          
          Gill shakes his head "no" as Hugo dials. Gill retrieves his
          own phone as he climbs out, dialing, moving to the trunk.
          
                                DR. GILL
                        (into his phone, quiet)
                    I'm going up now, give me ten minutes,
                    that should be enough time to prep...
          
          He clicks off, Hugo is completely unaware of the call he
          just made. Gill pops the trunk, removing his medical bag
          
                                                                    68.
          
                                HUGO
                        (still on his phone)
                    C'mon, somebody answer...
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- SAME
          
          The phone rings, Beanie moves to answer it, tossing his balled
          up Versace shirt to Soot/Vitoli.
          
                                BEANIE
                        (looking back)
                    That's a silk blend B, six-hundred
                    and change an s'got vomit and bile
                    and stomach contents all over it-- I
                    ain't gonna tell'ya how t'get the
                    mafucka clean, jus' put it right.
          
          Soot nods, unfurls a laundry tote, sticks the shirt inside,
          hand moving within the bag--
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                        (pointing to Israel's
                         soiled jacket)
                    Check the man's calf-skin coat too,
                    he look like he got some cinnamon
                    roll an' shit all over it--
          
          --Beanie, turning, reaching down for the ringing phone when--
          THWAP-- something plunks him hard from behind-- he's knocked
          forward by the force of the impact-- startled-- instinctively
          slapping at that area-- thinking something stung him.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!?
          
          He looks around, alarmed, head on a swivel, hand probing the
          pain, not aware of the blood coursing from that spot,
          streaming down his back...The phone continues to ring.
          
          Then Beanie hears the small metallic warble of something
          rolling around on the floor behind him, gradually settling.
          A sensation overtakes him...and he grows very still with it.
          
          He looks down at his hand for the first time...sees blood
          there, reaches up with that same hand and finds the tattered
          hole right above the base of his spine-- small wisps of smoke
          drifting up out of the wound...He turns, numb...and sees
          what looks like a spent shell casing, just ejected, coming
          to rest on the tile...The phone continues to ring.
          
          His eyes track upward to Vitoli the Butler, holding a silenced
          9mm-- aim still held...And that's when it dawns on Beanie...
          ...He's just been shot in the head.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                        (almost to himself)
                    Aw hell no you ain't just do that...
          
                                                                    69.
          
          Three more soundless shots from the 9mm put a humane end to
          these proceedings-- blowing Beanie's body over a sofa chair.
          His three-hundred plus pound frame slides to an unceremonious
          halt in the remnants of the shattered coffee table.
          
          Israel's calf-skin coat lies near Beanies dead body, a pool
          of blood surrounding it, soaking through and all the while...
          The phone continues to ring.
          
          INT. BEDROOM -- SAME
          
          Ivy and Israel, oblivious to what's gone on, fifty feet away.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    What did you say to Mecklen?
          
          Israel looks from the ringing phone-- to the gun in his bag--
          no good-- Ivy will kill him before he clears the bedspread.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    That's probably him now...
          
                                SIR IVY
                    ...See, this is one'a them rare
                    moments when y'ass get a chance to
                    be completely honest...and if I'm
                    asking you what you said to Mecklen,
                    assume the shit is rhetorical...so
                    assume I already know.
          
          Ivy lets that .50 caliber hang like intimidation itself.
          Israel looks over at the ringing phone, then back at Ivy.
          He slowly withdraws the deck of cards from his robe pocket,
          begins shuffling at lightspeed, firing them across his body,
          left to right, right to left.

                    close my eyes.
          
          He does, snatching a card cold from the deck, turning it to
          Ivy.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    King of Clubs...You pick up this

                    up this deck it's a living, breathing
                    thing. What do you see right now?
                    You see exactly and only, what I
                    choose to show you....That's illusion
                    Ivy. That's the lie I tell your
                    eyes. The manipulation of movement.
                    Knowing where your gaze wants to go,
                    guiding it there. Making the magic
                    happen in that moment, that split-
                    second, but seeing behind it, knowing
                    it's all bullshit...Built on sand.

          fingers, flesh mottled at the tips, horribly scarred over--

                    Pasquale Acosta-- Mercenary-- "El
                    Estrago"-- "The Plague"
          
          CUT BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Carruthers' expression goes black...
          
                                LOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    When he was caught by the SAS in
                    Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he
                    chewed off his fingertips to the
                    bone before he could be printed and
                    ID'd by Interpol.
          
          Carruthers stares at those fingers, backs against the wall,
          hand moving slowly toward his waist-- suspicions pique.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Can't maintenance do that?
          
                                ACOSTA/BILL
                    Do what?
          
          Carruthers unclips his belt holster.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Shut the elevators down.

          Acosta...sensing it...keeping his back turned.
          
                                ACOSTA/BILL
                    An emergency shut down of our entire
                    elevated lift system? No sir. That
                    has to be handled by my staff.
          
          Carruthers gets a hand on the stock of the .45 on his hip.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    How long have you worked here?
                        (beat)
                    Bill.
          
          A long, drawn silence...then, static emits from Bill/Acosta's
          belt-- his walkie-talkie was working all along. Jig's up.
          
          Acosta spins back-- spring-loaded blade firing from his sleeve--
          Carruthers clears his holster-- Acosta closes the gap-- blade
          flashing, passing through Carruthers' hand, slashing tendons,
          shearing bone, hot butter.--
          
          Carruthers screams-- grip gone, gun tumbling-- instinct kicks--
          his good left hand hauls the .45 out of mid-air, clutches,
          squeezes-- BLAM! Acosta's abdomen eats the blast, burps
          blood-- Carruthers, a severed hand tucked under his chin,
          held in place-- he extends, pulls, fires again-- Ricochets
          clip overhead fluorescents, fixtures catch strays-- shatter--
          glass filament explodes-- razor slivers rain down.
          
          Acosta, struck, slumping-- a silver automatic appearing from
          his other sleeve, trigger finding finger just as the last of
          the lights flicker and die-- A beat sustained-- just hard
          breathing and fluid hitting the floor-- Everything goes stiff--
          
          --the two take silent aim in the pitch black and fire
          simultaneously, blazing away-- emptying their weapons into
          each other from inside three feet-- Gunblasts illuminate
          ghoulish features, muted screams covered in gore...

          Georgia Sykes, concerned, finger to her ear, picking up
          something off her IFB earpiece: Muted gunshots, static-
          scrambled ...it's the sound of Carruthers and Acosta, ending
          one another's lives in the lift below...
          
                                SYKES

                                WATTERS
                    Are you anywhere near the penthouse?

                                SYKES
                    No, but that definitely sounds like
                    shots and I don't where it's comin'
                    from--

                    --It's your IFB, somebody else has
                    got an earpiece, you're picking up
                    their signal--
          
                                SYKES
                    --I thought we had secure frequency.
                    Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't
                    goin' off right now.
          
          Watters hears something crackle over one of the scanners...
          a transmission to Nomad security staff...
          
                                WATTERS
                    ...Oh, fuck these fools...
          
          Sykes looks up to see the elevator has reached her floor.
          
                                SYKES
                    What's wrong?
          
                                WATTERS
                    Security's locking down the elevators.
          
          Sykes looks at the elevator doors in front of her as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME
          
          The Tremor Brothers, waiting arrival on the penthouse, armed
          to the teeth, each one tethered with an array of pistols,
          rifles, knives, hatchets, hacksaws; the tools of their trade;
          to be implemented in the most godless manner imaginable.
          
          Muzak drifts in over the speakers, when suddenly the car
          lurches, cables catch, brake boxes shriek and the elevator
          car comes to abrupt stop. The Brothers exchange looks as
          power is cut and they are plunged into darkness...An emergency
          recording sounds from the elevator's ceiling speaker.
          
                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Please remain calm...Elevator service
                    has been temporarily suspended and
                    will resume momentarily...
          
          The recording defaults into a maddening loop...then, the
          sounds of someone unzipping a bag in the dark, hands moving
          objects around, metal clanks off metal as the bag is rummaged.
          A brilliant flash, hot white to iridescent red as a road
          flare is struck, showering Darwin Tremor with a deluge of
          sparks as he holds it aloft.
          
                                                                    74.

                    Les' get at it then.
          
          Lester and Jeeves, effortless aplomb; the speed and dexterity
          of a seasoned pit-crew. Lester pulls a torque wrench from
          the bag, pops the panel bolts on the elevator's power box
          and strips the electrical wiring in seconds--
          
          Jeeves removes a gas-powered generator from their Mary Poppins-
          like carry-all carpet bag. He primes the pump, yanks it to
          a sputtering start and feeds the AC lead to his brother.
          Lester takes it, locates the service override conduit and
          ties in. Darwin admires this deft display of skill from his
          idiot brethren. As the elevator's power cycles back on we...

          INT. BATHROOM -- DAY
          
          Light switch flipped on, revealing the shrunken, shriveled,
          fetal-like form that is Hollis Elmore being carried by MARGIE
          TURLOCK, 63, part-time RN, full-time souvenir shop owner. A
          substantial, tank of a woman, Margie manhandles Elmore,
          dropping him into a lukewarm bath, brimming with grey water.
          
                                 MARGIE
                    Okay sweetie, now I'm a registered
                    nurse and this was my bath not a
                    half hour ago, so it ain't as hot as
                    it could be, but we're gonna get you
                    all toasty warm in no time--
                        (beat, to boy)
                    Warren, Warren-- go on an' get grandma
                    her hot blanket and her heating bag,
                    the one in there under the sink in
                    my bathroom.
          
          Warren sniffs, licks lovingly on an ice cream sandwich, but
          never bites it.
          
                                   WARREN
                    Slower Nana.     Talk slooooooeerrrrr.
          
          Margie indulges her grandson, no end.
          
                                MARGIE
                    Okay Shug...Grandma needs you to go
                    in--
          
          --Warren begins to smile, a snarl of misshapen yellow teeth,
          smeared with chocolate, bracketed by chrome-colored braces.
          
                                MARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Oh, you little foxy, trying to fool
                    your Nana! You heard me didn't you!?

                                MARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                        (beat)
                    Now Boogie, Grandma needs her big
                    helper boy now, go on an' get those
                    things and grandma'll rub your feet!
          
                                WARREN
                    My karate feet? My crazy Karate
                    kick feet!!
          
          Warren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins
          hopping up and down, kicking, striking the wall with great,
          disturbing ferocity. Margie cackles at this.
          
                                MARGIE
                    You little angel-butt! Grandma'll
                    rub those feet forever!
          
          Elmore, struggling against imminent death, watching this
          display with increasing dread. He scans the sink basin--
          sees it lined with anti-depressants; Ritalin, Thorazine, etc
          Warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Oh you silly-sil! Never mind,
                    Grandma'll get it!
          
          Margie marches off and Warren immediately rushes over to
          the tub, placing himself directly over the inert Elmore and
          assuming a martial arts stance. He opens his mouth to speak
          and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out, landing in the tub.
          
                                WARREN
                        (barking out)
                    Bow to your opponent!
          
          Warren bows before he squares up and begins methodically
          delivering a "Kata" of punches and kicks...violently and
          expertly snapped within millimeters of Elmore's face. Elmore,
          helpless to raise his arms or defend himself, stares in horror
          as the boy, his glasses beginning to fog and drip with
          perspiration, works himself into a furious lather.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (trying to speak)
                    Pl-- kid, st-- stop...
          
          Elmore holds up his stump   of a hand,   pinky wagging in pathetic
          plea-- no use-- Warren is   in a state   of unhinged, near-animal
          frenzy-- his eyes wild, a   small, yet   prominent erection
          beginning to poke through   his karate   gee...
          
          Margie returns to the bathroom, scolds her grandson.    He
          squares up on her, feigning a blow to her face. She     clouts
          him, hard backhand, big flabby arms restraining him,    hauling
          him out of the bathroom. He bleats like a butchered     sheep.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          Elmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking-- he turns his head,
          gazing into the other room-- a newscast plays on the
          television: A Reporter, lakeside, via live feed...standing
          in the same parking lot where Deeks and Dupree were killed.

                    the parking lot of the nearby Nomad
                    Hotel & Casino...
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          Agent Messner arrives, flanked by shotgun-toting Sheriff's
          deputies, local cops and Bureau field agents. They deploy,
          cordoning off the scene, taking control.
          
          WE SEE Hugo and Doc Gill, ducking down, Hugo still has the
          phone to his ear. As they approach a rear stairwell with a
          door that reads: "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY: PENTHOUSE LEVEL"
          two FEDS descend, chaining and bolting the door.
          
                                HUGO
                    Shit...answer the fucking phone.

          The phone is still ringing as Soot, Browning 9mm at his side,
          stalks the voices coming from the master bedroom
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          Ivy, fingers brushing his gun grip, stares Israel down.
          
                                SIR IVY

                                ISRAEL
                        (nodding to phone)
                    That's Mecklen. The deal's closing.
                    I can pick that phone up and I can
                    work this out.

                    You'll walk with me.
          
          Israel readies the playing card behind his back, slips it
          between his index and middle finger-- Ivy shakes his head.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    All that slight a'hand you can do
                    and you still ain't never learned to
                    lie right--
          
          --Israel steps hard, slinging the Ace sidearm, sailing it
          toward Ivy, surgical strike, right eye, blood bursting at
          his browline-- Ivy goes down in a heap.
          
                                SIR IVY (CONT'D)
                        (enraged)
                    MOTHERFUCK! MOTHERFUCKER!
          
          Ivy, doubled over-- he drags the .50 cal from its holster
          and lets fly-- FIRING. Big bore rounds rip right through
          the wall, punching dinner-plate sized holes in the plaster.
          Israel goes to the ground as Ivy, bleeding, blazes away--
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- ANTEROOM -- SAME
          
          --Soot takes cover as bullets whistle by-- he tucks the 9mm
          away just as the doors to the suite are blitzed and the
          security team stumbles in, guns drawn, grouped tight--
          
                                SECURITY TEAM
                        (in unison)
                    DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!
          
          They assume quasi-combat stances; six idiots, crab-crawling
          their way across the room. Soot stays prone, plays scared,
          realizes that his rubber appliance nose has come loose, tries
          to adjust it-- can't, has to hide his face, burying it in
          his sleeve, wiping more make-up off in the process--
          
          Mustache is on point, pistol trained.    He spots Soot cowering.
          
                                 MUSTACHE
                        (to Soot)
                    Are you hit?
          
          Soot shakes his head a vigorous "no" as Mustache and his men
          turn their attention to the bedroom.

                    GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
          
          Mustache and his men round the corner into the master bedroom.
          
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- SAME
          
          Ivy, down on one knee, depth perception shot, trying to
          reload, bullets slipping through blood-slicked fingers--
          Israel lies on the floor behind the bed, breathless, chest
          heaving, frantically trying to pull the small automatic pistol
          out of his overnight bag.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                        (advancing on Ivy)
                    Drop-that-gun-right-now!
          
          One of the bodyguards spots the body of Beanie, lying dead
          in the remnants of the coffee table.
          
                                SECURITY MEMBER #1
                    Jesus, he got Beanie...
                        (back to Mustache)
                    He shot Beanie!
          
                                ISRAEL
                    What?
          
          Ivy hears this, let's the gun slide from his hand, standing,
          eye swollen to a bleeding slit.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    GET ON THE GROUND!
          
          Ivy, looking past them, seeing Beanie's lifeless body, laying
          there. Israel peers out, sees the same thing.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Jesus Christ...
          
          Two of the bodyguards rush to Beanie, bending over his body,
          checking for vitals. Ivy, suspended in the doorway, stunned.
          One of the security team looks back; no good...he's gone.
          Just then, the phone stops ringing.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (looking up at Ivy)
                    ...you just murdered Beanie...
          
                                                                    80.
          
          Ivy, shocked, dismayed. Israel, starting to see his sweetheart
          deal with the Feds go up in smoke. He immediately mobilizes.
          
                                      ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                              (to Mustache)
                       Hey!
                           (pointing to Ivy)
                       Get him out-- muscle him if you have
                       to. Take him down the quietly, use
                       the service exit. Then get back up
                       here and we'll handle the rest of
                       this.
                           (off Mustache's look)
                       What? Is there somebody else in
                       there?
          
          Soot, from the other room, careful to keep his face concealed.
          
                                      VITOLI
                       Eees Vitoli.
          
          Israel, a grimace...two too many people involved. Israel
          nods, thinking, does a bump of coke, right out in the open.
          
                                   ISRAEL
                           (to security)
                       Avert your eyes gents, y'didn't see
                       that.
                           (beat, rolls neck)
                       Okay Vitoli, listen these last few
                       minutes make you a material witness,
                       do you understand what that means?
          
                                   VITOLI
                       ...How can I be of assistance...
          
                                   ISRAEL
                       You do know what that means!
                       Tremendous, that's the attitude.
                           (beat, clutching chest)
                       Alright, Vitoli, hang tight for half
                       a tic, we've got a special sort of
                       "clean-up" we gotta do here, alright?
          
          Soot nods.
          
                                   ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                           (to Mustache)
                       What's he doing, is he getting this?
          
          Mustache, glancing over at Soot, seeing him nod.
          
                                   MUSTACHE
                       Yeah, he's nodding.
          
                                   ISRAEL
                       Good. Now Move.
          
                                                                       81.
          
          Mustache and his men brace Ivy, taking advantage of his
          disorientation and dismay and swiftly escorting him out.

          They amass around the elevator, taking care to double handcuff
          Ivy now. Mustache pushes the call button. It fails to light.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

                    What about the other four?   Are they
                    out?
          
          He keeps hitting the call button, but it won't light.

                    Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes comin'
                    out that suite. S'probably where
                    you heard that shootin' earlier,
                    somebody jus' downed Israel. He
                    dead, our play is dead.
          
          Sykes, getting some separation on the elevator doors, pulling
          her 9mm, using it like a crowbar.
          
                                SYKES

                    ...Maybe spend the night?
          
          Sykes, struggling, when the doors suddenly retract on their
          own...She's staggered by what she sees in the elevator,
          tripping back, heels catching, dumping her on her ass--
          
                                SYKES

                    ...oh...damn...
          
          She sits up, stupefied...cordite and pistol smoke drift out
          of the open elevator doors like a funeral dirge. The sound
          of a bone-saw emanates from within.

          Carruthers and Acosta...wartorn, shot to hell, post-battle
          standoff, just staring, weapons emptied, bodies bullet-
          punctured, leaking life...both are breathing, but just barely.
          
                                WATTERS (OVER HEADSET)
                    What is it...?
          
          Filament and glass dust cover everything. Blood streams in
          steaming fissures, floating spent shell casings and
          fluorescent shards cover the floor of the car.
          
          Acosta, clinging to life itself, clutching the whirring bone
          saw, trying in vain to reach Carruthers. Sykes wades forward,
          wary, Glock vise-gripped.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...Shhhhhhit...girl, there's these
                    two dudes, just sittin' here in this
                    elevator, all shot up...
          
                                WATTERS
                    What?
          
                                                                       83.
          
                                SYKES
                        (beat, looking around)
                    They musta been beefin' big time
                    with one another, cuz this shit, got
                    way past words, whatever it was.
          
                                WATTERS
                    ...What are they doin' right now...?
          
          Sykes, glancing from Carruthers to Acosta. A beat.
          
                                 SYKES
                    Right now?
                        (beat)
                    ...Dying.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. "LAKEY'S SOUVENIR SHOPPE" -- KITCHENETTE -- DAY
          
          Elmore, seated, wrapped in quilts and heated blankets,
          shivering horribly, lips blackened, flexing brittle fingers
          on his good hand, trying to restore feeling, teeth clattering
          like ten thousand tea cups. Margie Turlock enters, arms
          loaded down, grandson Warren hot on her heels, a set of
          Nunchukas under his arm...
          
          ...Elmore, palpable hatred, pure bile for the boy.
          
          Margie sets the assortment of goods down on the table in
          front of Elmore; tourist-themed hats & sweatsuits from the
          shop, a pair of thermals, a collection of pill bottles and
          what appears to be an old Vietnam-era ammo box.
          
                                MARGIE
                    So them fellas were your friends
                    then? The ones that was shot and
                    tossed into the lake? Were they police
                    officers too?
          
          Elmore nods, rifling the pile in front of him, going for the
          pills. Margie pulls a pot of coffee off the stove, pours a
          mug. Sets it down in front of him.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                        (motioning to pills)
                    Them was left over from my
                    hysterectomy, so they're a few years
                    old, might be outta date.
          
          Elmore eyes the labels; Vicodin, Vioxx...morphine-based.
          Nice...Just numb it all.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    You sure you don't want me to call
                    an ambulance honey?
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                    84.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's crazy you not going
                    in...y'got what looks like hypothermia
                    and real bad frostbite. They could
                    wind up amputatin' if y'don't get it
                    treated.
          
          Warren sits in the chair next to Elmore and begins mimicking
          him, shaking epileptically, doing his doofus bit, tucking
          three fingers away, waving a stump, belly-laughing...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Warren! Now you go and practice
                    your nunchucks now, leave us be for
                    a bit Shug.
          
          Warren scowls, getting up, in super-slow motion, making sounds
          with his mouth as he stands, robotic whirs, buzzes, clicks--
          Margie chuckles at her grandson, she can't help it--
          
          Then, in a blur, Warren snaps, abruptly slamming the nunchakas
          on the table, the rebounding portion of the weapon almost
          hitting Elmore in the face. He bolts the room before Grandma
          can scold him, his titters echoing off like taunts...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    ...M'sorry about that boy, his momma
                    abandoned him going on a year now,
                    his daddy, my boy Dale-- Gulf War
                    vet, s'over in the Reno-Washoe
                    Correctional facility-- got some
                    "clarity" issues. He did some home
                    invasion sodomy-torture type stuff,
                    wrote a buncha bad checks, got hisself
                    consecutive life terms-- shipped off
                    to Soledad there in California.
                        (beat, scribbles
                         something down)
                    --reminds me, I got that care package
                    I need to send off--
                        (beat, continues lament)
                    Anyhoo, m'husband Bill took the
                    coward's route, n'committed suicide
                    by hangin' 'bout nine months back.
                    Ever since then, little Boogie there's
                    been the man'a the house!
                        (beat, gnarled grin)
                    And we make a darn cute couple I
                    think!
          
          Margie, cackling again-- the facade of sanity showing serious
          signs of strain...Elmore pulls the ammo box across the table.
          Stenciled on the side: "177th Airborne Division -- Charlie
          Company - Reckon" He cracks the lid.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't think that's been opened
                    since my husband died.
          
                                                                    85.
          
          Inside, army memorabilia and bric-a-brac; patches, service-
          tags, dog-earred b&w polaroids, ancient titty mags, (which
          make Margie horribly uncomfortable) Saigon bottled beer and
          most importantly, a .357 Colt Python.
          
          Elmore lifts it, looks it over, feels the heft, drops the
          chamber-- it's loaded. He sifts some more, palms loose bullets
          at the bottom of the box. He cracks a blackened grin, rolling
          the pistol's chamber and snapping it shut as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          A padlock being locked and secured.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY
          
          Elevators and access doors locked down indefinitely. Casino
          and hotel patrons file out in less than orderly fashion.
          Craps players, pissed that their "hot streaks" have been cut
          short, harangue police and sheriff's personnel in passing.
          Barflys and blackjack habituates, accustomed to staying in
          one spot for months on end, have to be manually removed.
          
          The four call girls, trying to argue their way past security
          and onto one of the elevators, realizing they're not getting
          anywhere near the Penthouse level. Messner coordinates the
          Nomad's exodus, continually adjusting his earpiece, trying
          to contact Carruthers, two agents flank him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                         (to agent)
                    I want you to locate Agent Carruthers
                    now.
                         (beat, to another
                          agent)
                    The guests that aren't able to leave
                    need to be confined to their suites.
                    And under no circumstances are they
                    to venture out, for any reason. Have
                    the staff make calls to that effect.
          
          The pimply Casino Employee is at the center of an intensive
          on-spot interrogation being conducted by a group of agents.
          Messner arrives, stares at the kid.
          
                                MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    This him?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                        (nodding, then to kid)
                    Alright Ricky, I want you to explain
                    to Agent Messner exactly what
                    happened and do it slowly please.
          
          The kid, head bobbing, gnawing fingernails, cuticles mangled.
          
                                                                      86.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, ye-- I-- uh, there were,
                    earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
          
                                MESSNER
                    --Agent Carruthers. Do you know where
                    is he now?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He uh-- he asked about-- I'm-- he
                    wanted to know whic-- what floor
                    security was on, then I saw him get
                    on the elevator with the other agent.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (quick, thrown)
                    Wait a minute, what other agent?
                        (beat, to others)
                    What other agent?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                    I have no idea. It wasn't anybody
                    from our office.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He said he was from San Francisco.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Did he give you his name?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, uh-- it was Spanish-somethin'
                    Garcia, or Diego, uh--
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to other agents)
                    --run both those names through the
                    D.C. database. Call San Francisco,
                    see if they've got anybody in the
                    field doing collateral inquiries for--
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    --he was wearing one of our jackets.
          
          Messner stops cold.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Who?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    The other agent. He said he was here
                    to do an inspection and later, when
                    he got on the elevator with the other
                    guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing
                    one of our security jackets...
          
          Messner turns, bores in on the kid, no more bullshit now.
          
                                                                     87.
          
                                MESSNER
                    This man wearing the jacket identified
                    himself as an Federal agent?
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Uh, yeah.
          
                                   MESSNER
                    You're sure?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, he had the badge and everything.
                    It said "FBI" on it.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And when you saw him later, he was
                    wearing one of your security jackets--
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And that didn't seem odd to you?
          
          The kid glances around, oops-- my mistake-- tries to amend.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    I-- I mean, I thought they gave it
                    to him so he cou--
          
          Messner turns on his heels, the other agents tag along.
          
                                 MESSNER
                        (addressing others)
                    We may have a man posing as one of
                    us. Get a tactical team assembled.
                    We need to get to the penthouse level
                    immediately.
          
                                FBI AGENT
                    We'll have to power the elevators
                    back up.
          
                                   MESSNER
                    Do it.
          
          As they move past the group of call girls, still arguing
          with security as we...
          
                                                             ...CUT TO:

          Israel, sickly, face bloodless, sitting down on a couch,
          setting the small handgun down on the table next to him. He
          digs at his chest now, in considerable pain, rotating his
          arm around, trying to rouse it.

          Israel gazes at Beanie's body, trying to figure out an
          appropriate course of action.

                    this out...
          
          He takes out his cellphone, dialing Morris Mecklen. Soot
          appears behind him, easing the 9mm out of his waistband and
          resuming his stalk...ever...so...slowly.

          gradual stop. She leans over him...the stiletto blade he
          used to dispatch "Bill" and hack Carruthers digits off has
          retracted back into his sleeve.
          
          Sykes begins patting him down, moving dangerously close to
          that sleeve, her neck hovering right above that spot--

          THE HEARTBEAT crescendos wildly, out-of-control...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          ...A BELL-RANGER HELICOPTER, the heartbeat becoming the thwack
          of rotor blades as it lifts off with Deputy Director Locke
          and an FBI tactical team inside...

          ...a kaleidoscope of scenarios about to be played out at the
          exact same second...shared fates...Shakespearean fraught...in
          this soundless realm the CAMERA TAKES US PAST THE FOLLOWING:
          
          HUGO -- Looking on in horror as Israel collapses.
          
          DOC GILL -- Rushing to Buddy's aide.
          
          SOOT -- Bringing the 9mm up, leveling it on Hugo.
          
          CAMERA MOVES OUT INTO THE PENTHOUSE HALLWAY PAST:
          
          MUSTACHE -- Sensing grave danger, his gun being drawn. His
          m
           en following suit.
          
          IVY -- Pulling away from his captors, looking for cover.
          
          DARWIN TREMOR -- Stepping from the elevator, strapped with
          a
            sawed-off pump shotgun in one hand, a vintage elephant gun
          in the other, looking for lives to end.
          
          s
          LESTER TREMOR -- Chainsaw snarling, spewing oil, psycho smile
           preading viral across a pockmarked face.
          
          JEEVES TREMOR -- Sledgehammer in a scabbard on his back,
          h
           olding WWII era German "Potato-Masher" grenades, gripped
          like drumsticks, pins pulled. He hurls them.
          
          CAMERA MOVES PAST THEM, DOWN ELEVATOR SHAFT TO:
          
          SYKES -- Pulling extra clips from her handbag, securing them
          under her garter belt, dumping her heels in favor of hose.
          
          ACOSTA -- Pant leg lifted, moving panther-quiet, tortoise-
          slow, unfastening the snap on his ankle-holster.
          
          c
          CARRUTHERS -- Near death, eyes locked on Acosta, his mortal
           ombatant, trying desperately to reach his own ankle holster.
          
          MESSNER -- Watching as his team moves into place around the
          e
           levator. Checking his own piece, flicking off the safety.
          
          CAMERA MOVES OUT THE WINDOW AND UP TO:
          
          WATTERS -- In the Hotel window across the way, sniper-rifle
          s
           nug to her shoulder, eye on the scope, waiting for the word.
          
          CAMERA MOVES THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE UP TO AND INSIDE EARPIECE
          
          Inside the earpiece at 10000x normal magnification; micro-
          sound condensers and circuits the size of skyscrapers. Then,
          a voice makes the landscape tremble, like the trump of God:
          
                                SYKES
                    Bring it.
          
          THE CAMERA SUDDENLY REVERSES PATH
          
                                                                       95.
          
          Back out of the earpiece, down through the scope, over the
          barrel of the rifle...BOOM...A .50 caliber bullet is birthed.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELS BACK TO:
          
          The fourteenth floor window of the Nomad detonates with
          concussive ferocity-- creating a hailstorm of shattered glass
          that sweeps the length of the hallway, engulfing cops and
          feds whole.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Another round tears in after it, exploding a gilded ceiling
          stanchion, sparking off the rebar, tripping the sprinkler
          system, dousing the corridor-- everybody runs for cover.
          
          One of the AGENTS, wounded, summons another elevator.
          Messner, undeterred, advances on the elevator containing
          Sykes and Carruthers.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELING BACK
          
          Sykes, Glock ready to rock, about to move. Acosta, pulling
          a pistol from his ankle-rig, preparing to backshoot Sykes.
          
          CAMERA ASCENDS BACK UP THROUGH SHAFT
          
          Chaos. Carnage. Full blown bloodbath. Heavily-armed men on
          an overkill override. Mustache and Co., waging close quarters
          warfare with the Brothers Tremor. Bullets blaze, bodies
          drop, everything burns--
          
          CAMERA CONTINUES PAST SCENE TO:
          
          Soot, shooting Hugo several times-- Hugo falling back,
          confused by the abrupt pain, baffled by the appearance of
          blood. Gill, overtop of Israel, trying to force feed him
          nitro-glycerin tablets. Buddy goes into full cardiac arrest.
          
          Disparate sounds collide now, swell to a great tumult-- an
          incomprehensible crescendo of explosions and chainsaws and
          gunshots and screams as we--
          
          CUT TO BLACK

          HARD CUT UP ON:
          
          All of it happening at lightspeed. Watters, reloading,
          watching as leaden contrails of gunsmoke pour from the
          pulverized fourteenth floor. She resumes her assault.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Messner, a few feet from the car containing Sykes. More
          sniper fire rakes the hallway. Another elevator arrives,
          opens...call girls inside. They snuck up somehow, past
          security... The gunplay gets them spooked, scared-- they
          scramble from the car-- cops and feds try to stuff them back
          inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down.
          
          One of the girls catches a hard ricochet, wig leaping off
          her head as a bounced bullet punches through her skull-- she
          crumbles, instant casualty. Messner hardly notices, moving
          instead toward the other elevator car.
          
                                MESSNER
                    THIS IS THE FBI! THROW YOUR WEAPON
                    OUT! SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!
          
                                SYKES
                        (whispering into IFB)
                    Are these feds fake or for real girl!
          
          Carruthers, pawing feebly at her, moaning-- trying to warn
          her-- she shrugs him off.
          
                                WATTERS
                        (yelling)
                    I DON'T KNOW!

                    Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep
                    these mafuckas off my as--
          
          BANG-- Sykes squeals, spins back, feels numbness spread over
          her legs and lower trunk, knows she's been shot.
          
                                                                       97.

                       We're out girl! I'm shot! I'M SHOT!--
          
          ACOSTA fires again, bullet ripping through her studded
          bustier, gouging kevlar, nicking ribcage-- embedding into
          the IFB receiver on her hip, ruining it. Sykes falters--
          tries to raise her gun--
          
          Acosta raises his aim to her head, about to deliver the coup
          de grace-- Messner appears now, sees Acosta, sights him when--
          
          BLAM!BLAM!    BLAM!!
          
          Acosta's chest explodes, he slumps, the gun sliding away--
          Messner swings wide on the car to reveal:
          
          Carruthers, smoking gun, trembling aim, exposed ankle
          holster...empty. Sykes, kevlar burning, smashed round still
          hot, she tries to pull her vest off, finds her newly paralyzed
          arm uncooperative. Messner, advancing now, keeping an eye
          on his partner as he moves toward the car.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       LADY, SHOW ME YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW!
          
                                   SYKES
                       I NEED MY HANDS MOTHERFUCKER! I'M
                       HIT! KILL ME OR LET ME BE!
          
          Messner enters the elevator, rushes to the doomed Carruthers.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       How bad?
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Mortal.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       No.
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Yeah.
          
          Messner takes his partner under the arms, lugging him into
          the open hallway, stripping off his shirt. Carruthers severed
          hand nearly falls away from the rest of his arm.
          
          Acosta spits blood from the lungs-- his breathing now a bog
          of pinched snorts and gurgles.
          
                                   MESSNER
                           (re: Acosta, yelling
                            to the others)
                       SECURE THIS SUSPECT!
          
          TWO FEDS enter to remove Acosta from the car-- he lets out a
          guttural yelp as they hoist him-- real pain or playing possum,
          
                                                                       98.
          
          impossible to tell...As his legs clear the elevator doors,
          they slowly close on the wounded Sykes.
          
          Messner, tries to prevent them from closing, can't-- gazes
          up at the digital counter as the elevator continues its ascent
          to the Penthouse level...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Sykes, riding up, wounded, vulnerable, trying to reach the
          control panel to stop the car. She keys her now useless IFB.
          
                                SYKES
                        (into IFB)
                    Girl, I'm inside, I'm on my way up--
                    this elevator is going to the
                    Penthouse-- can you hear me--? Baby,
                    can you hear me--
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- TOP FLOOR -- SAME
          
          --Watters, panicked, pulling the Barrett up off its tri-pod,
          hitting the hallway, double-timing to the stairwell...She
          has no idea that she's lost radio contact with Watters.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Sit tight if you can hear me Girl!
                    I can't do shit for you from here.
                    I'm moving down for a sightline!

          INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Plaster and debris everywhere, sprinklers tripped, most of
          Mustache's team shot, shredded or burnt to a crisp. Pieces
          of building and bodies either waterlogged or fully ablaze.
          Mustache and Darwin play duck and cover, exchanging fire.
          Jeeves, out of grenades, sledgehammer swinging, crushing
          wall studs, scattering remaining security team members.
          
          Ivy, sheltered, having survived the opening salvos, gets
          ahold of a gun from a chainsaw-shorn former security member;
          Lester sees Ivy arming himself, blitzes him-- chainsaw
          snarling, revved out, sending fantails of gristle and chipped
          bone everywhere. Less than fifteen feet separate them.
          
          Ivy fires, shots deflected off the blade's teeth, seconds
          from getting gutted-- he adjusts his aim high, emptying the
          gun into Lester's chest, bullets blazing haywire, blowing
          out between Lester's shoulders, stopping a hard charge cold.
          
                                                                       99.
          
          Lester, lopsided, bullet-dazed, drools blood...then dies.
          Ivy dumps his clip, searches for another-- the chainsaw falls,
          stalls.
          
          Jeeves, hefting the sledgehammer like a hayseed John Henry,
          looks over as his older brother's life come to an end. He
          reacts badly.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    LESTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
          
          Jeeves buries the sledge in a wall, takes up the chainsaw,
          rips the pullcord, resumes the charge--
          
          Ivy, finds a clip, slams it in the stock, points, pulls--
          trigger-stick, hammer-jam. He falls to his back, scurrying
          away, trouble finding traction, soles slipping-- he keeps
          pulling the trigger. Jeeves straddles him from above, raises
          the saw like a great wooden stake, about to bring it down--
          
          --BAM!
          
          Ivy's automatic discharges. The round splits the saw's gas
          tank, spritzing fuel, dousing Jeeves-- A beat before the
          tank suddenly arcs, exploding, lighting Jeeves up like a
          four-hundred pound bonfire, bouncing him off the walls; a
          human Hindenberg, fully engulfed. He flails, burns, howls,
          falls...molten fat melts off his body like lard butter...
          
          Darwin, dismayed, both brothers down...He moves on Mustache,
          dispatches him with detached efficiency, snapping his neck
          clean. He then starts toward Ivy, who's trying desperately
          to crawl out of there.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Hugo, crawling across the floor, knees dragging over his own
          blood trail, trying to reach: Israel, on the ground, dying.
          Soot's gun has jammed. He clears it efficiently, patiently
          reloading the weapon as Doc Gill, in panic mode, performs
          full chest compressions on Buddy as we--

          Messner, doing the same to Carruthers, trying to restart his
          heart. Acosta, lays there silently, slowly bleeding out,
          being tended to by a team of agents. In the b.g. Cops and
          Feds gather near the window, searching for the assailant,
          binoculars and rifle scopes strafing the Horizon hotel across
          the way, concentrating at the open window near the top floor.

          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          WATTERS, running up the hallway, past alarmed maid service
          and hotel staff. She reaches the lower floor window and
          raises the scope to her eye, searching for Sykes--
          
                                WATTERS
                    Girl, where are you-- talk to me...how
                    bad are you hit...
          
          WATTERS POV
          
          She sees the Feds and Cops in the Nomad window across the
          way. Smoke clears, her field of vision through the scope
          expands, sharpens.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    Georgia goddamn baby, please talk to
                    me, please say somethin' so--
          
          --And that's when she spots the call girl, face obscured,
          lying dead from a headshot in the hallway...her heart
          sinks...and she assumes the worst: Sykes is dead.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    MOTHERFUCKERS!!
          
          She flicks to full-auto and opens fire right through the
          glass in front of her-- big gas-ejected shells pop from the
          breach like bowling pins-- the gathered throng across the
          way in the Nomad window seem to vaporize in a violent collage
          of heat, blood and building chunks-- Watters bucks big sobs,
          blasting away with the Barrett...

          Sykes, standing now, knock-kneed, kevlar discarded, down to
          a black bra and mini-skirt, blood dribbling over her midriff,
          deep indentation near her sternum-- big yellow bruise in
          bloom-- the bullet didn't penetrate...her elevator arrives
          at the penthouse level and as the doors open we--
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Darwin, looming over Ivy, about to bring the sledge down
          squarely on his skull-- the elevator doors open in his
          periphery... He looks over, sees Sykes standing there, barely
          clothed, wet with blood, gun in her hand...and grins.
          
                                                                      101.
          
          Sykes, seeing Darwin standing over Ivy, holding a sledgehammer--
          recognizes him as the perv from earlier. She levels the Glock,
          stepping out of the elevator, steadying herself against the
          wall, steadying her aim on Darwin's head.
          
                                SYKES
                    Drop that hammer...
                        (beat, cocking gun)
                    And I drop this one.

                    Know a killer motherfucker...know
                    they voice. Know they feel...and
                    know you 'bout to die by one.
          
          Then, the sound of an helicopter intrudes, rotor thrum,
          building steadily, growing louder-- the floor seems to shake
          as the chopper approaches-- nervous eyes dart-- nobody moves.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          The chopper draws closer, growing louder-- Hugo, still trying
          to crawl toward his downed boss. Soot finishes him off with
          a flush headshot. Gill, frantic, rapid chest compressions
          on Israel, who gags, starts, coughs, heart back up and
          beating. His watery gaze moves from Gill to Soot, who know
          stands overtop of him, aiming the 9mm down at him.
          
          Israel averts his eyes...the end has come. He looks over
          and sees his lamb-skin coat, lying there, soaking in Beanie's
          blood, ruined beyond recognition. A tear escapes his eye.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    ...forgive me...
          
          Soot puts the gun flush with Buddy's skull when suddenly,
          the ceiling begins to tremble and shake...the sound of a
          helicopter filling the air.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Messner is losing Carruthers, can't revive him, begins to
          crack-- hammering on his chest...it's no use. He's dead.
          He sobs-- something slides from his pocket. He glances down...
          
          ...sees that the bag containing Elmore's severed fingers has
          fallen from his pocket. Doesn't remember hanging onto them.
          He replaces them in his pocket. Looks down at his dead
          friend, sees his severed hand, also missing fingers...
          
          ...the absurdity of this makes Messner want to cry laughing...
          
          ...and that's when he hears the chopper...and sees it as it
          rises up past their floor, past the contingent of Cops and
          Feds slugging it out with Watters across the street.
          
                                                                    102.

          Watters, ears ringing with gunfire reverb, reloading-- salvos
          of return fire ripping back at her-- then, all at once, the
          shooting stops-- She pauses, thinks it's a ploy-- then slowly
          peers over the window sill as the Bell-Ranger comes into
          view, over the Nomad, touching down on its narrow rooftop.
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE -- SAME
          
          The doors to the Penthouse level are bashed open and the
          windows implode as FBI tactical agents repel in, weapons
          drawn, swarming, surrounding the scene, shouting commands--
          Darwin Tremor drops the sledge, jackrabbits for the elevator,
          diving in as the doors close--
          
          Sykes, stumbling toward Ivy. He sees she's injured, scoops
          her up like a new bride-- she places something in his
          hand...Acosta's fake FBI credentials. Ivy looks, nods, gets
          it-- agents approach, combat crouches, MP-5's at arms.
          
                                AGENT #1
                    Let me see your hands!
          
          Ivy, flashing the I.D., taking care to cover the photo.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    This woman's been shot, I need to
                    get her medical attention immediately!
          
          Commotion and confusion swirl. The Agent, unsure, searching
          for some confirmation-- can't find it, dismisses them and
          rushes into the Penthouse. Sykes and Ivy slip out the exit.

          badly, seizures still hobbling his heart. Gill, being patted
          down by the Agents, prescription pills confiscated. Soot is
          held at gunpoint and flex-cuffed, the remainder of rubber
          appliance pulled off his face.
          
          The agents begin to initiate an "All Clear" over their radios.
          Moments pass before Deputy Director Locke enters the room,
          He approaches Soot, studies him, to one of the agents;
          
                                   LOCKE
                    Soot?
          
          The Agent nods confirmation. Locke reaches into Soot's coat,
          finds his cellphone...hits redial.

          He reaches the seventeenth floor, rounds the corner, nearly
          runs into Messner, has a gun thrust in his face.

          Messner, eyes moving from Ivy to Sykes. Stalemate, no sense
          pushing. He moves past them, hits the stairwell exit on
          eighteen. Ivy and Sykes resume their trek down the stairs.
          
          INT. HALLWAY -- PENTHOUSE FLOOR
          
          Messner, bashing in from the stairwell. WHIP PAN OVER TO
          REVEAL: The Swede, still accompanied by the Sparazza goons,
          arriving in the elevator at the same time.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. ELEVATOR
          
          Darwin, on his way down, rolling around on the floor of the
          car, covering himself in congealed blood and bullet casings,
          slicking back his hair, losing the security jacket, splashing
          yet more blood on himself. Satisfied, he snatches Carruthers'
          F.B.I. credentials up off the floor...and waits.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME
          
          The elevator arrives at the far end. A small asian man
          carrying a stack of clean towels steps off and starts down
          the hall-- sees Watters, sees the .45 trained on him-- does
          an abrupt about face and disappears back inside the car.
          
          Watters lowers the gun, wipes tears, the area around her is
          littered with spent .50 caliber shells. The fourteenth floor
          of the Nomad is now empty. Sirens wail in the distance.
          Down below, Watters can see a bevy of law enforcement
          personnel streaming toward the Horizon. She slowly takes
          the Barrett off the ledge, begins breaking it down, glancing
          up at the Penthouse of the Nomad as we...
          
                                                             ...CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- SAME
          
          Director Locke waits. Messner and The Swede appear in the
          doorway. The Swede nods to all concerned and starts toward
          Israel. Doc Gill acknowledges the Swede.
          
                                DR. GILL
                    Dr. Ingstrom, he's had a mild cardiac
                    episode and recurring arrhythmia,
                    I've given him 60cc's of Nobuneatol...
          
          The Swede kneels down next to Israel, dropping his black
          valise, cracking it open. Messner, dazed, dumbfounded, sees
          Locke.
          
                                MESSNER
                    ...Deputy Director Locke?
          
          Locke approaches, lays a comforting arm on Messner, guiding
          him to a chair.
          
                                 LOCKE
                    Here. Sit.   Please.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (pointing to Swede)
                    This is him? The hitman hired to
                    kill Israel? He's a doctor?
          
                                LOCKE
                    Difficult to explain everything now...
                        (beat, toward Israel)
                    And much larger issues loom.
                        (beat)
                    I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest
                    thing to have to die for.
          
          The Swede, working on Israel, shaking his head, something's
          wrong. He stands, crosses to Locke, silently confers.
          
                                                                   107.

                    Very well.
                        (to other Agents)
                    Take Mr. Israel to the roof, he'll
                    be traveling with us.
          
          Suddenly, Soot breaks from his captors, sprinting for the
          shattered Penthouse windows, launching himself-- a swan dive
          out into the open air-- He hangs there for a moment, an
          aesthetically striking form; like Lazarus cast against a
          cobalt blue sky, backlit by the sun from the lake below--
          
          --till gravity grabs, pulls-- plummeting him toward earth,
          sending him headlong into the vast expanse of concrete below.
          This startlingly event is dismissed by mutual shrugs and a
          collective lack of concern.
          
          Messner is absolutely agog.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to Locke, forceful)
                    What the hell-- What is this!? People
                    died. Agent Carruthers is dead!

                    jetway at Tahoe International. I'm
                    sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing
                    anymore information. Return to
                    Washington. You'll be debriefed in
                    the coming days.
          
          Locke says no more-- starts out of the Penthouse with the
          Swede, Dr. Gill and Buddy Israel in tow. A Bureau forensics
          team arrives to quietly tag and bag the dead...Messner stands
          there, absolutely agog.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY -- DAY
          
          Hives of activity. Cordons and crime scene lockdowns like
          onion layers, multiple law enforcement agencies, confounded,
          confused-- too many cooks, too many kitchens. Nobody knows
          who the hells in charge. Local paramedics and EMT's cart
          out the wounded. Coroners and M.E.'s cart out the dead.
          
          Reporters and national news outlets crowd police barricades
          outside, competing for coverage, as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Acosta is wheeled through the lobby, hooked up to IV and
          oxygen, looking ghastly, like something exhumed. He catches
          the eye of the pimply casino employee and manages a wink.
          
                                                                   108.
          
          He's flex-cuffed to the gurney and pushed against the wall
          for the moment as the Agents move off to deal with the recent
          appearance of Lazlo Soot-- whose body has been unceremoniously
          splattered over the parking lot.
          
          As the Agents depart, Acosta peers down at his shackles;
          simple plastic binding rods-- he smiles...a moment later the
          stiletto blade fires from his sleeve as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Darwin Tremor staggering out of an open elevator, blood-
          sodden, head down-- FBI badge held aloft for all its worth.
          Playing it up, free pass, Agents rush in, hold him upright,
          help him toward a line of awaiting ambulances outside as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Ivy and Sykes, being released from the stairwell, cut chains
          sliding off-- Ivy holds up pilfered FBI creds. Rampant
          confusion makes the moment possible. He's waved through,
          carrying Sykes, looking every bit the good Samaritan.
          
          Sykes, a mess of mascara, adorned in her unmentionables,
          looking every bit the prostitute she appears to be-- she
          spots the woman at the counter from earlier. The woman gazes
          back, jaw agape. Sykes can only shrug...if you can't beat
          'em-- join 'em. She and Ivy cross the lobby as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Messner...morose, exiting another elevator with the sheet-
          draped body of Carruthers on a gurney. Gandersen, the Nomad
          owner, spots him, starts over, looks to unleash, gets close
          enough to catch Messner's expression. Sees it in his
          eyes...enough dead bodies for one day. Messner continues
          moving through the lobby, hears the chopper taking off as--
          
          CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL:
          
          Through the clear glass atrium of the Nomad, the Bell-Ranger
          goes airborne against an impossibly clear winter sky, banking
          south toward Las Vegas.
          
          CAMERA TILTS DOWN TO REVEAL:
          
          The Horizon hotel across the way: The Fourteenth floor window.
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- DAY
          
          Watters, gear stowed, seemingly indifferent about the level
          of law enforcement heading up her way, about to launch an
          Alamo-like last stand in honor of her fallen sista.
          
          She hears commotion erupt from outside as survivors begin
          filing from the building. She takes up the Barrett, gazing
          through the scope, looking, looking, looking...stops...holy
          shit...it's her. It's Sykes.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          And she's alive and being carried by a man, a big gorgeous
          black man that she's gazing upon with utter love and longing.
          A boulder-sized lump takes shape in Watters throat; betrayed,
          backbit-- tears come to fast to contain, too many to control.
          
          Numbed...the sensation leaving her fingers, she finds herself
          racking the bolt on the Barrett and gazing through
          crosshairs...taking aim on Ivy's head. Behind her, the
          elevator arrives, an a dozen armed cops, hoo-rah from it,
          hustling the length of the hall, descending down on her--
          
                                WATTERS
                        (whispering)
                    ...I loved you baby...
          
          BOOM!
          
          EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE -- NOMAD HOTEL -- SAME
          
          A gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks-- Darwin Tremor
          snaps his head around at the sound, moving past platoons of
          Cops and Feds now rushing that way. His I.D. is out,
          affording him easy egress. He hops the stairs up, top level,
          Barracuda parked at the rear of the lot. As he approaches...
          
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey...
          
          Darwin glances over at...Hollis Elmore, standing there, skin
          horribly discolored, disease afflicted. He wears a hooded
          tourist sweatsuit; "Ta-Hoe, Ta-Hoe It's Off To Fun We Go!"
          stitched in cursive across the front. He's holding the Colt
          Python against his hip.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (nodding to Cuda)
                    That your car?
          
          Darwin, a beat, what-to-do...hillbilly-acumen in overdrive.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I'm confiscating it.
                        (holding up badge)
                    F.B.I.
          
          Now Elmore raises the Colt with his good hand, advancing on
          Darwin, moving gingerly, his legs not quite there...
          
                                ELMORE
                    You're F.B.I.?
          
          Darwin tries to stay tight, composed.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    That's right...and I'd advise y'ta
                    lower your weapon sir.
          
          Elmore keeps coming.
          
                                                                   110.

                        (blanching a bit)
                    Ww...uh...
          
                                ELMORE
                    Three men were ambushed and shot,
                    two died and had their bodies tossed
                    into the lake, the other has severe
                    hypothermia, possible dementia and
                    will probably be a multiple amputee
                    by week's end...if he even lives
                    that long.
          
          Darwin, uh-oh...
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I ain't even heard abou--
          
          --Oops.
          
                                ELMORE

                    You "ain't"--
                        (beat, teeth clenched)
                    You have any idea how close to death
                    I've been? You understand that I'm
                    dying now? That I've survived bullets
                    and frostbite and raging fever--
                        (holding up hand)
                    missing fingers and every fucking
                    imaginable horror in between?
          
          Darwin...speechless...he's done.
          
                                ELMORE (CONT'D)
                    And I'm asking you now, "Is that
                    your car" and you can't even come
                    clean and do me the decency of a
                    straight answer, with the fucking
                    state that I'm in!?
          
          Elmore, that Colt looking like a cannon this close to Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, shit-- hell, you're right. I'm
                    sorry.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You shot me and murdered my friends.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I did. We-- yeah, I know.
          
                                                                   111.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And threw us into the lake.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Pretty much, yep.
          
          Elmore, still nodding.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And this is your car, isn't it?
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Mmm-hmm.

                    But there were more of you?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, m'brothers...They didn't make
                    it.
          
                                   ELMORE
                    Two of 'em?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                        (nods, tears flow)
                    Thass' right.
                        (beat, wiping eyes)
                    I got other brother's though, so it
                    ain't so bad.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You were here huntin' a man named
                    Israel, weren't you? Your name is
                    Tremor.
          
          Darwin gazes up at Elmore, some fraternal bond forms.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I was. It is...That who you was here
                    for? Israel?
          
          A pause. Elmore nods.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    Well...we both got beat out then,
                    didn't we?
          
          Darwin, slowly lowering the Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    Yes we did...
                        (long pause, then)
                    Now, give me your car keys. And get
                    the fuck out of here.
          
          Darwin, sifting through his pockets, tossing Elmore the keys.
          
                                                                     112.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    S'fair...lemme just grab somethin'.
          
          Elmore brings the Colt back up.   Darwin, hands up, hold on--
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    No, no, no, I'm done with all that.
          
          He reaches in, pulls a joint off the dashboard, forages,
          finds matches, lights up, starts off.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                        (to 'Cuda)
                    Probably needs to be tuned. Air
                    filter's old. Plugs might be bad.
                    Heater and AC ain't worked in forever.
                        (seeing Elmore waver)
                    There's some good drugs in the glove
                    box there, homespun, keep you smiling,
                    semi-lucid at leas'...
                        (beat, puffing away)
                    Well, God's speed t'ya then. Sorry
                    'bout all that. S'way a'the world
                    though, winners and losers y'know.
                    S'way it's always goin' be...
          
          Darwin, walking away, taking huge hits off that joint,
          traipsing down the steps, getting stoned out of his mind.
          Elmore, considering, re-considering, looking at that Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    ...Oh, fuck that...
          
          --As he back shoots Darwin with all six rounds from the
          Python, blowing holes through him. Darwin goes lop-sided,
          legs failing, lit-joint still smoking in his mouth as dies
          standing, only to fall like cut timber seconds later.
          
          Elmore acts quickly, sliding into the 'Cuda and starting it,
          that big block Hemi roaring to life under the hood.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- DAY
          
          Pedestrians and passerbys drawn to the commotion at the Nomad,
          the bottleneck bogs traffic down, making it impossible to
          move. Elmore crouches low as police and emergency personnel
          cross in front of the car... Slowly, the crosswalk begins to
          thin and then finally clear...save a single man:
          
          Messner...standing right in front of the Barracuda, staring
          at the tires, staring at Elmore. The two lock eyes as he
          moves around to the driver's side, reaching into his pocket--
          
          --Elmore lifts the Colt up off his lap, putting his heavily
          bandaged hand on the wheel. Then he sees Messner's FBI creds,
          clipped to his belt-- can't tell if this one's legit.
          
                                                                   113.
          
          He sets the Colt down on the floorboard as Messner walks up,
          pulling a plastic bag from his pocket: The one containing
          three severed fingers. He glances down at Elmore's mummified
          left hand, holding out the bag for him to take.
          
          Elmore, unsure, accepting the bag, seeing what's inside,
          embarrassed by it-- he sets it down on the seat next to him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Your friends were taken to Carson
                     City Memorial, they're going to be
                     autopsied and shipped back for burial.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I'll take care of it.
          
          Messner, nodding. A beat.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Who owned this car?
          
          Beat.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     The ones that killed 'em.
          
          Beat.   Messner nods.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Where are they now?
          
          Elmore looks up at him-- what does it matter...
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I just want to go home man...I just
                     want to go home and forget this
                     fucking place even exists.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Where's that? Home.

                     Las Vegas.
          
          Messner, a thought, then:
          
                                 MESSNER
                     You're injured...Let me drive.

          FADE UP ON:
          
          INT. CEDARS SINAI -- LAS VEGAS NEVADA -- DAY
          
          Messner walks in, cleaned up, pressed suit, no tie. He badges
          himself past the front desk. An ORDERLY approaches.
          
                                                                      114.

                    floor?
          
          Messner nods.
          
                                ORDERLY (CONT'D)
                    Very well.

                    You can take that stairwell up, the
                    I.C.U. is at the end of the hall.

          INT. CEDARS SINAI -- THIRD FLOOR -- DAY
          
          Messne exits the stairwell. Droves of Feds and justice
          department types crowd the third floor hallway, around the
          I.C.U. The mood is subdued. The Swede exits a per-op suite,
          dressed in scrubs and a surgical gown, talking with Dr. Gill,
          who is also dressed for surgery.
          
          Messner searches the hall for a familiar face...finds
          it...Locke, far end, talking with an aide.
          
                                LOCKE

                    Basic bullet points-- despondent
                    over the turn his career had taken,
                    troubles with the law, history of
                    substance abuse and so on--
          
          The aide sees Messner approach. Locke follows her eyes, turns.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Where's Israel?

                                MESSNER
                    --no, we need to handle it now.
          
          Locke, angered, handing his clipboard to the aide, taking
          Messner by the arm, leading him away.
          
                                LOCKE

          A gun is in Locke's side now-- against his ribs-- he looks
          down, stunned...Now it's Messner who's leading him away.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       You're going to tell me why no call
                       was made to inform us that the Israel
                       situation had been "altered." Why I--
                       and my friend and partner, whose
                       body is going into a furnace tomorrow,
                       were not sufficiently apprised of
                       Bureau movement on this matter.
          
          Locke, pale, shook up.

                           (jams gun into ribs)
                       The Swede isn't a hitman, is he?
                       He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't
                       want Israel's heart for a trophy, he
                       wanted it for a transplant...why?

          Locke and Messner enter. In an oxygen tent erected on one
          side of the room, sits the shrunken figure of Primo Sparazza.
          On the other, a barely conscious Buddy Israel. Both men are

                    He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed
                    under for over ten years, amassing
                    materials against the mafia and other
