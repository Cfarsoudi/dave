	FADE IN:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

	A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
	surround it.

	CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

	The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
	WORLD OF LIQUOR.

	TITLE CARD:

				BIG SPRING, TEXAS
			   109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
			345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

	A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
	a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
	in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
	mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

	It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
	off duty for the day.

	The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


	INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
	stool behind the counter.

	A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

	A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

				MCGRAW
		Hot goddamn day!

				PETE
		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

				MCGRAW
		Not even for lunch?

				PETE
		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

				MCGRAW
		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

				PETE
		Whatsamatter?

				MCGRAW
			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

				PETE
		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

				MCGRAW
		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

				PETE
		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

				MCGRAW
		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

				PETE
		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

				MCGRAW
		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

				MCGRAW
		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

				PETE
		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

				PETE
		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

				SETH
		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

				PETE
		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

				SETH
		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

				SETH
		Were you giving that pig signals?

				PETE
		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

				SETH
		He says you were scratching.

				PETE
		I wasn't scratching!

				SETH
		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

				PETE
		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

				RICHARD
		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

				PETE
		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

				SETH
		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

				MCGRAW
		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

				PETE
		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

				RICHARD
			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

				PETE
			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

				PETE
		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

				SETH
		What the fuck is wrong with you --

				RICHARD
		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

				SETH
		Start the car.

				RICHARD
		You believe me don't cha?

				SETH
		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


				SETH
			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
		I told you that bastard said, "Help
		us!"

				PETE
			(yelling)
		I never said help us!

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Well that don't matter now, 'cause
		you got about two fuckin' seconds
		to live! Richie!

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		Yeah?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		When I count three, shoot out the
		bottles behind him!

				RICHARD
		Gotcha!

				SETH
		One... Two... Three.


	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.



	EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
	flames.

				SETH
		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

				RICHARD
		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

				SETH
		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

				RICHARD
		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
	starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
	hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

				SETH
		Low profile. Do you know what the
		words "low profile" mean?

	CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

	The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
	the street, and speeds off down the road.

	We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
	behind it, as the store burns out of control.

	OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

	Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY

	The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
	OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
	trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
	prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
	boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

	The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
	and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
	on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

	AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

	The rest of the titles play over black as the song
	continues.

	CREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS

								  CUT TO:

	EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
	290.

	SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':

		   FORT STOCKTON
		238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER


	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

				JACOB
		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

				SCOTT
		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

				SCOTT AND KATE
		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

				JACOB
		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

				SCOTT
		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

				KATE
		-- you got your microwave --

				SCOTT
		-- you got your sink --

				KATE
		-- you got your shower --

				SCOTT
		-- see this, television!

				KATE
		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

				JACOB
		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

				SCOTT
			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

				KATE
			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

				JACOB
		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

				KATE
		Ain't it the truth.

				SCOTT
		Why do you want to stop?

				JACOB
		I'm exhausted.

				SCOTT
		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

				JACOB
		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

				KATE
		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

				SCOTT
		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

				KATE
		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

				JACOB
		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

				KATE
		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

				JACOB
		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

				KATE
			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

				JACOB
		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

				KATE
		That happens, you'll get it back.

				JACOB
		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

				KATE
		What do you think Mom would say?

				JACOB
		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE UP: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it. RING.


	INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A
	standard issue Texas motel. Richard sits outside in the car.
	Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five
	times.

				TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)
		Hold your horses!

	An OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter.
	He's eating a BBQ rib.

				OLD-TIMER
			(rough)
		Whatcha want?

				SETH
		Whatcha think I want, ya mean old
		bastard? I wanna room.


	EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
	radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
	walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
	and drives them to their room.

				RICHARD
		Do they have cable?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have an X-rated channel?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have a waterbed?

				SETH
		They don't have anything except four
		walls and a roof, and that's all we
		need.

	Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
	trunk close to the door.

	The two brothers get out of the car.

				SETH
			(tossing Richie the motel keys)
		Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

	Richie opens the door.

	Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
	empty.

	CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

	TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

	SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
		up in the trunk.

	She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
	scared and looks an absolute mess.

				SETH
		Don't say a word.

	The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
	the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
	trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
	see any, slams the door.


	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY

	Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

				SETH
		You. Plant yourself in that chair.

	She sits down in the chair.

				HOSTAGE
		What are you planning on doing with --

				SETH
		-- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
		talk. You wanna get on my good side?
		Just sit still and don't make a peep.

	She shuts up.

	Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
	wound.

				SETH
		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

				SETH
		How's it feel?

				RICHARD
		How ya think, it hurts like a
		son-of-a-bitch.

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

				SETH
		I got both rooms on either side of us,
		so we don't gotta worry about
		eavesdropping assholes. How's that
		feel? You okay?

				RICHARD
		Feels good.

				SETH
		I'm gonna go get the money.

	He heads for the door.


	EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY

	Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
	the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.


	INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY

	Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
	the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping
	stations. Seth looks at his watch.

				SETH
		It's about five o'clock.
			(to hostage)
		What time does it get dark around
		here?

				HOSTAGE
		About seven.

				SETH
		Good. I'm going towards the border to
		check things out while it's still
		daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
		rendezvous.

				RICHARD
		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

				SETH
		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

				RICHARD
		Did you even to try to negotiate?

				SETH
		These guys ain't spic fire cracker
		salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's
		scripture. So it is written, so shall
		it be done. You want sanctuary, you
		pay the price, and the price is thirty
		percent.

				RICHARD
		All I'm saying --

				SETH
		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

				SETH
		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

				HOSTAGE
		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

				SETH
		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good. Then let me explain the house
		rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about
		rule number one?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

				SETH
		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

				SETH
		Open your eyes.

	She does.

				SETH
		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my
		word. Okay?

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I'll be back in a bit.

	He exits.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


				RICHARD
		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

				RICHARD
		Come on.

	She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
	next to him.


	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the
	middle of a conversation with the party on the other end.

				SETH
		Things are real hot here. Crossing's
		gonna be a bitch.
			(pause)
		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border
		as possible? Texas wants our balls.
		The quicker we're in your protection,
		the better I'll feel.
			(pause)
		Okay, where?
			(pause)
		The Titty Twister?
			(he laughs)
		I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
		see you and your men at the "Titty
		Twister" tomorrow morning.

		Bye, my friend.

	Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his
	Zippo lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving
	the frame empty, a subtitle appears:

	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows,
	watching TV, taking on hits from a water bong in the
	shape of a wizard.

	ON TV

	A local newscaster named KELLY HOUGE is reporting a story
	about the brothers.

				KELLY HOUGE
			(talking to camera)
		This bloody crime spree started just a

		brothers...

				KELLY HOUGE (V.O)

		Rolling's Kansas State Penitentiary

		enforcement officers lost their lives.

	BACK TO KELLY

				KELLY HOUGE
		Having served eight years of his
		twenty-two year sentence, Seth Gecko
		was brought to Wichita Municipal court
		house for his first parole hearing. It
		was while at the court house that this
		man...

	MUG SHOT OF RICHARD GECKO

				KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
		... his younger brother Richard Gecko,

		pulled off a daring daylight escape...

	VIDEO INTERVIEW

	Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

				STANLEY CHASE
		For the time being we are very
		confident we will apprehend the
		fugitives in the next forty-eight
		hours. The Bureau, local law
		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

				STANLEY CHASE
		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

				STANLEY CHASE
		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

				KELLY HOUGE
		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

				STANLEY CHASE
		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

				STANLEY CHASE
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

								  CUT TO:

	RICHARD SMILES.

				RICHARD
			(Newscaster's voice)
		Is it safe to assume since the law
		enforcement authorities in the great
		state of Texas are homosexuals of a
		sick and deviate nature, that they
		will be too busy fucking each other
		up the ass to actually catch The
		Gecko Brothers?
			(in an FBI voice)
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

	He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
	Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

				CASPER
		Would you play with me?

	A big burly COP turns around.

				COP
		Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

	The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

	Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
	take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

				RICHARD
		Shit, I started to get worried. Where
		the fuck ya been?

				SETH
		Sight seein'.

				RICHARD
		What'd ya see?

				SETH
		Cops.

				RICHARD
		Didya look at the border?

	Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
	and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
	the TV

				SETH
		Yeah, I saw the border. Through
		binoculars from on top of a high
		building. That's about as close as I
		risked getting. What's the TV say?

				RICHARD
		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		I gotta figure a way to get across
		that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
		around El Paso our lives ain't worth
		a shit.

				RICHARD
		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

				SETH
		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

				RICHARD
		How do you know?

				SETH
		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
		our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
		is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
		rendezvous on the other side, then
		Carlos and his boys will escort us to
		El Ray and --

	Seth stops talking and looks around.

				SETH
		Where's the woman?

				RICHARD
		What?

	Seth's out of his chair.

				SETH
		What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
		woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
		is she, Richard!?

				RICHARD
		She's in the other room.

				SETH
		What the fuck is she doin' there?!

	He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

				RICHARD
		Seth, before you open the door, let
		me explain what happened.

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

	Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
	room with the dead body.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

				RICHARD
		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
		just explain what happened.

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

				SETH
		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
		explanation. What's the matter with
		you?

				RICHARD
			(low and calm)
		There's nothing wrong with me,
		brother. That woman tried to escape
		and I did what I had to do.

				SETH
		No.
			(pause)
		That woman wouldn't of said shit if
		she had a mouthful.

				RICHARD
		Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
		wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
		became a whole different person.

				SETH
			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

				RICHARD
		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

				SETH
		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

				RICHARD
		Seth, if you were me --

				SETH
		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

				RICHARD
		Yes.

				SETH
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

				RICHARD
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

				SETH
			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

				KATE
		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

				KATE
		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

				JACOB
		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

				KATE
		It's a flop house.

				JACOB
		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

				KATE
		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

				JACOB
		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

				KATE
		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
	THUD... THUD...

				KATE
		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

				JACOB
		Watch where you're going!

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

				SCOTT
		What's this guy's problem?

				JACOB
		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

	HONK!

				JACOB
		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

				KATE
		Creepy guy.

	SETH

	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

				JACOB
		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

				RICHARD
		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

				JACOB
			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

				JACOB
		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

				SETH
		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

				RICHARD
		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

				RICHARD
		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

				JACOB
		Jacob.

				SETH
		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

				RICHARD
		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

				SETH
			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

				JACOB
		He's my son.

				SETH
		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

				JACOB
		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

				SETH
		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

				JACOB
		What's this about, money?

				SETH
		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

				SETH
			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

				KATE
		What's going on?

				RICHARD
		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

				JACOB
			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

				SETH
		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

				JACOB
		On the dresser.

				SETH
		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

	CLOSE-UP KATE
		
	She smiles at him.

				KATE
		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
		
				RICHARD
		Sure.


				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

				SETH
		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

				SETH
			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

				SETH
		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		Do you believe me?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

				JACOB
		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

				SETH
		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

				JACOB
		Not a chance.

				SETH
		Come again?

				JACOB
		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

				SETH
		Sorry, I need everybody.

				JACOB
		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

				SETH
			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

				SETH
		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

				SETH
		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

				SETH
		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
	the Lone Star night.


	INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

	Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
	and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

				KATE
		Excuse me.

	Richard zeros in on her.

				RICHARD
		What?

				KATE
		Where are you taking us?

				RICHARD
		Mexico.

				KATE
		What's in Mexico?

				RICHARD
		Mexicans.

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
	wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
	seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
	calmly.

				SETH
			(reading his driver's license)
		Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
		ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
		course it is.
			(motioning behind him)
		What are their names?

				JACOB
		Scott and Kate.

	Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

				SETH
		Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
		Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

				SETH
		Who's this?

				JACOB
		My wife.

				SETH
		Where is the little lady?

				JACOB
		In heaven.

				SETH
		She's dead?

				JACOB
		Yes, she is.

				SETH
		How'd she die?

				JACOB
		Auto wreck.

				SETH
		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

				JACOB
		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

				SETH
		Died instantly?

				JACOB
		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

				SETH
		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

				JACOB
		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

				SETH
		Is this real?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

				JACOB
		Real McCoy.

				SETH
		You're a preacher?

				JACOB
		I was a minister.

				SETH
		Was? As in not anymore?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Why'd ya quit?

				JACOB
		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

				SETH
		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

				JACOB
		How do I know you'll keep your word?

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

				JACOB
		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

				SETH
		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Didn't like it, did ya?

				JACOB
		No, I didn't.

				SETH
		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

				JACOB
		You won't let him touch her?

				SETH
		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

				SETH
		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

				SETH
			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

				JACOB
		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

				SETH
		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

				KATE
		Yeah.

				SETH
		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

				KATE
		Yeah, we got a bible.

				SETH
		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

				SETH
		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

				SETH
		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

				JACOB
		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

				SETH
		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

				SETH
		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

				RICHARD
		Did ya mean what you said back there?

	Kate turns to him.

				KATE
		What?

				RICHARD
		In the room. Were you serious, or were
		you just foolin' around? I'm just
		bringing it up, 'cause if you really
		want me to do that for you, I will.

				KATE
		Do what?

				RICHARD
			(in a whisper)
		What you said to me in the room.

				KATE
			(whispers back)
		What did I say?

				RICHARD
			(whisper)
		You asked me if I would --

				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		What?

	Seth and Jacob.

				SETH
		I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say
		talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say
		to one another. So cut the chatter.

	Richard turns to Kate.

				RICHARD
			(quiet)
		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

				SETH
		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

				SETH
		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

				JACOB
		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

				SETH
		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

				JACOB
		I don't have the slightest idea.

				SETH
		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

				SCOTT
		What are you gonna do?

				JACOB
		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

				SCOTT
		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

				RICHARD
		This isn't gonna work.

				SETH
		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

				RICHARD
		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

				SETH
		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

				RICHARD
			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

				SETH
			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

				RICHARD
		What does that mean?

				SETH
			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

				RICHARD
		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

				SETH
		No, I didn't.

				RICHARD
		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

				SETH
		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

				RICHARD
		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

				SETH
			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

				RICHARD
			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

				SETH
			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

				RICHARD
			(quiet back)
		Or what?

	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		

				JACOB
		Have you forgotten about your sister?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

				JACOB
		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

				JACOB
		What about Kate?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

				JACOB
		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

				SCOTT
		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

				JACOB
		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

				SCOTT
		He's running the show.

				JACOB
		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

				BORDER GUARD
		How many with you?

				JACOB
		Just my son and I.

				BORDER GUARD
		What is your purpose in Mexico?

				JACOB
		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

				RICHARD
		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

				SETH
		This ain't the time.

				RICHARD
		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		What was that?

				JACOB
		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		You said it was just you and your son.

				JACOB
		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

				BORDER GUARD
		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

	CLOSE-UP KATE

	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

				KATE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

				KATE
		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

				KATE
		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

				BORDER GUARD
		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

								  CUT TO:

	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

				SCOTT
		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

				SETH
		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

				SETH
			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

				SETH
		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

				SETH
		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

				JACOB
		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

				SETH
		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

				KATE
			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

				SETH
		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

				JACOB
		Then?

				SETH
		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

				SETH (O.S.)
		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

				SETH
		You okay?

				RICHARD
			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

				SETH
		I don't know, you just passed out.

				RICHARD
		I did?

				SETH
		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

				RICHARD
		Really?

				SETH
		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

				RICHARD
		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

				SETH
		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

				RICHARD
		We are?

				SETH
		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

				RICHARD
		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

				SETH
		They broke when you fell.

				RICHARD
		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

				SETH
		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

				RICHARD
		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

				SETH
		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

				SETH
		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

				JACOB
		Guys! We're here.

								  CUT TO:

	A neon sign that flashes:

		THE TITTY TWISTER
		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
	TWISTER DANCERS."

	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

				CHET
		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

				SETH
			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

				SETH
		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

				JACOB
		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

				SETH
		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

				RICHARD
		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

				SETH
			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

				RICHARD
		That's what you think?

				SETH
		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

				RICHARD
		I'm lookin' scared?

				SETH
		That's what you look like.

				RICHARD
		You know what you look like?

				SETH
		No, Richie, what do I look like?

				RICHARD
		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

				SETH
		How?

				RICHARD
		Where are you right now?

				SETH
		What do you mean?

				RICHARD
		Where are you?

				SETH
		I'm here with you.

				RICHARD
		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

				SETH
		My shit is together.

				RICHARD
		It don't look together.

				SETH
		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

				RICHARD
		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

				CHET
			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

				CHET
			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

				SETH
		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

				CHET
		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
	NOSE.

	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

				SETH
		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

				RICHARD
			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

				SETH
		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

				SETH
		Whiskey!

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

				SETH
		What dya mean?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

				SETH
		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

				SETH
			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

				BIG EMILIO
			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

				SETH
		No, I'm going to count to three.

				BIG EMILIO
		Uno...

				SETH
		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

				JACOB
		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

				JACOB
		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

				SETH
		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

				RICHARD
		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

				SETH
		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

				RICHARD
		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

				SETH
		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Best in Mexico.

				SETH
		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

				RICHARD
		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

				SETH
		Who else?

				JACOB
		Pass.

				SETH
			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

				JACOB
			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

				SETH
		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll have one.

				JACOB
		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

				SETH
		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

				KATE
		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

				JACOB
		Why are you so agitated?

				SETH
		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

				JACOB
		He backed down.

				SETH
		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

				JACOB
		What are you going to do?

				SETH
			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

				JACOB
		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

				SETH
			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

				JACOB
		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

				SETH
		What did you call me?

				JACOB
		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

				SETH
		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

				SETH
		To your family.

				JACOB
		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

				JACOB
		Now, is your shit together?

				SETH
		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

				SETH
		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

				SCOTT
		Yeah, it's mine.

				SETH
		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

								  CUT TO:

	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

				SETH
		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

				SETH
			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

				RICHARD
		Yeah.

				SETH
		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

				RICHARD
			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

				SETH
		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

				SETH
		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

				JACOB
			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

				SETH
		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

				CHET
			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

				RICHARD
		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

				RICHARD
		How are you?

				SETH
		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

				SETH
		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

				RICHARD
		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

				RICHARD
			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

				SETH
		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

				WHORE
		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
	VAMPIRES.

	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

				SANTANICO
		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

				SANTANICO
		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

				BIG EMILIO
		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

				SETH
		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

				SEX MACHINE
		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

				SEX MACHINE
		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

				CHET
		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

	GULP.

	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

				CHET
		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

				CHET
		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

				FROST
		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

				SETH
		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

				RICHARD
		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

				SETH
		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

				SEX MACHINE
		He ain't your brother no more.

				SETH
		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

				JACOB
		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

				SETH
		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

				SETH
		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

				SETH
		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

				KATE
		Are you okay?

				SETH
		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

				KATE
		I'm really sorry.

				SETH
		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

				JACOB
		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

				JACOB
		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

				JACOB
		What the hell is that?

				FROST
		At first I just thought it was birds.

				SEX MACHINE
		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

				SETH
		It's bats.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

				JACOB
		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

				SEX MACHINE
		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

				SEX MACHINE
			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

				SEX MACHINE
		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

				SEX MACHINE
		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

				KATE
		Kate, what's yours?

				SEX MACHINE
		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

	WHAM !

	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

				SETH
		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

				JACOB
		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

				JACOB
		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

				SETH
		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

				SETH
		You too, preacher?

				JACOB
		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

				SETH
		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

				JACOB
		In the Winnebago.

				SETH
		In other words, no.

				SCOTT
		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

				SEX MACHINE
		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

				SETH
		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

				JACOB
		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

				SETH
		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

				FROST
		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

				SEX MACHINE
		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

				SCOTT
		That's werewolves.

				SEX MACHINE
		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

				KATE
		Does anybody have any silver?

				ALL
		No.

				KATE
		Then who cares?

				SCOTT
		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

				JACOB
		About two hours from now.

				KATE
		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

				SEX MACHINE
		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

				JACOB
		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

				SEX MACHINE
		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

				FROST
			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

				JACOB
		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

				SETH
		Aside from they're thirsty.

				FROST
		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

				JACOB
		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

				SEX MACHINE
		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

				SCOTT
		You could take their head off.

				SETH
		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

				SETH
		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

				JACOB
		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

				SETH
		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

				JACOB
		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

				KATE
		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

				FROST
		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

				JACOB
		What are you talking about?

				FROST
		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		Stop fucking saying that!

				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst!

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

				VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

				FROST
		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

				SEX MACHINE
		THIRST!

	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

				FROST
		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

				SEX MACHINE
		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

				SETH
		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

				JACOB
		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

				SETH
		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

				KATE
		We have to go back for Daddy!

				SETH
		Daddy's dead.

				KATE
		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

				SCOTT
		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

				SETH
		He needs our help!

				SCOTT
		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

				JACOB
		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

				SETH
		Did he...?

				JACOB
		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

				SETH
		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

				SETH
		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

				JACOB
			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

				KATE
		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

				JACOB
		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

				JACOB
			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

				JACOB
		What's this stuff?

				SETH
		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

				JACOB
		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

				SETH
		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

				JACOB
		Amen.

	MONTAGE

	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

				JACOB
		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

				SETH
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Kate, Scott?

				KATE
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Scott?

				SCOTT
		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

				JACOB
		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

				JACOB
		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

				KATE
		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

				JACOB
		Not good enough, swear to God.

				KATE
		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

				JACOB
		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

				SCOTT
		You don't believe in suicide.

				JACOB
		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

				JACOB
		Thank you, son.

				SETH
		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

				SETH
		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

				KATE
		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

				SETH
		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

				JACOB
		No!

				KATE
		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

				KATE
			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

				SETH
		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

				SCOTT
		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

				SETH
		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

				KATE
		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

				KATE
		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

				SCOTT
		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

				SETH
		How many bullets left, kid?

				KATE
		Not many.

				SETH
		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

				SETH
		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

				SETH
		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

				CARLOS (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

				CARLOS
			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

				CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

				SETH
		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

				CARLOS
		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

				SETH
		Have you ever been there before?

				CARLOS
		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

				SETH
		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

				CARLOS
		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

				SETH
		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

				CARLOS
		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

				SETH
		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

				CARLOS
		Twenty-eight.

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

				SETH AND CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


				CARLOS
		You like the car?

				SETH
		I said new, this is an '90.

				CARLOS
		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

				SETH
		So do I just follow you?

				CARLOS
		Yeah, follow us.


				SETH
		So let's do it.

				CARLOS
			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

				SETH
		I'm sorry.

				KATE
		Me too.

	Long pause.

				SETH
		See ya.

				KATE
		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

				KATE (O.S.)
		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

				KATE
		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

				SETH
		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

	A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
	surround it.

	CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

	The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
	WORLD OF LIQUOR.

	TITLE CARD:

				BIG SPRING, TEXAS
			   109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
			345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

	A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
	a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
	in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
	mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

	It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
	off duty for the day.

	The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


	INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
	stool behind the counter.

	A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

	A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

				MCGRAW
		Hot goddamn day!

				PETE
		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

				MCGRAW
		Not even for lunch?

				PETE
		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

				MCGRAW
		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

				PETE
		Whatsamatter?

				MCGRAW
			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

				PETE
		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

				MCGRAW
		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

				PETE
		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

				MCGRAW
		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

				PETE
		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

				MCGRAW
		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

				MCGRAW
		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

				PETE
		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

				PETE
		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

				SETH
		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

				PETE
		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

				SETH
		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

				SETH
		Were you giving that pig signals?

				PETE
		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

				SETH
		He says you were scratching.

				PETE
		I wasn't scratching!

				SETH
		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

				PETE
		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

				RICHARD
		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

				PETE
		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

				SETH
		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

				MCGRAW
		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

				PETE
		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

				RICHARD
			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

				PETE
			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

				PETE
		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

				SETH
		What the fuck is wrong with you --

				RICHARD
		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

				SETH
		Start the car.

				RICHARD
		You believe me don't cha?

				SETH
		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


				SETH
			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.

				SETH
		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

				RICHARD
		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

				SETH
		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

				RICHARD
		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
	starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
	hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

				SETH
		Low profile. Do you know what the

	CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

	prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
	boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

	The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
	and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs

	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

				JACOB
		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

				SCOTT
		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

				SCOTT AND KATE
		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

				JACOB
		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

				SCOTT
		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

				KATE
		-- you got your microwave --

				SCOTT
		-- you got your sink --

				KATE
		-- you got your shower --

				SCOTT
		-- see this, television!

				KATE
		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

				JACOB
		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

				SCOTT
			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

				KATE
			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

				JACOB
		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

				KATE
		Ain't it the truth.

				SCOTT
		Why do you want to stop?

				JACOB
		I'm exhausted.

				SCOTT
		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

				JACOB
		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

				KATE
		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

				SCOTT
		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

				KATE
		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

				JACOB
		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

				KATE
		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

				JACOB
		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

				KATE
			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

				JACOB
		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

				KATE
		That happens, you'll get it back.

				JACOB
		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

				KATE
		What do you think Mom would say?

				JACOB
		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

	SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
		up in the trunk.

	She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
	scared and looks an absolute mess.

				SETH
		Don't say a word.

	The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of

		Just sit still and don't make a peep.

	She shuts up.

	Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
	wound.

				SETH
		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

				SETH
		How's it feel?

				RICHARD
		How ya think, it hurts like a
		son-of-a-bitch.

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

				SETH
		I got both rooms on either side of us,

		What time does it get dark around

				HOSTAGE
		About seven.

				SETH
		Good. I'm going towards the border to

				RICHARD
		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

				SETH
		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

				RICHARD
		Did you even to try to negotiate?

				SETH
		These guys ain't spic fire cracker
		salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's
		scripture. So it is written, so shall
		it be done. You want sanctuary, you
		pay the price, and the price is thirty
		percent.

				RICHARD
		All I'm saying --

				SETH
		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

				SETH
		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

				HOSTAGE
		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

				SETH
		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good. Then let me explain the house
		rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about
		rule number one?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

				SETH
		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

				SETH
		Open your eyes.

	She does.

				SETH
		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my
		word. Okay?

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I'll be back in a bit.

	He exits.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


				RICHARD
		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

				RICHARD
		Come on.

	She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
	next to him.


	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the

		Things are real hot here. Crossing's

			(pause)
		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border

		The quicker we're in your protection,

			(pause)
		Okay, where?

		I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll

	Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

				STANLEY CHASE
		For the time being we are very

		fugitives in the next forty-eight
		hours. The Bureau, local law
		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

				STANLEY CHASE
		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

				STANLEY CHASE
		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

				KELLY HOUGE
		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

				STANLEY CHASE
		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

				STANLEY CHASE
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

								  CUT TO:

				RICHARD
			(Newscaster's voice)
		Is it safe to assume since the law

		sick and deviate nature, that they
		will be too busy fucking each other
		up the ass to actually catch The
		Gecko Brothers?
			(in an FBI voice)
		I would say that's a very safe

	He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the

				SETH
		Yeah, I saw the border. Through
		binoculars from on top of a high

		risked getting. What's the TV say?

		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		I gotta figure a way to get across
		that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
		around El Paso our lives ain't worth

				RICHARD
		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

				SETH
		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

				RICHARD
		How do you know?

				SETH
		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
		our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
		is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a

		Seth, before you open the door, let

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

	Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
	room with the dead body.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

				RICHARD
		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
		just explain what happened.

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

				SETH
		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
		explanation. What's the matter with
		you?

				RICHARD
			(low and calm)
		There's nothing wrong with me,
		brother. That woman tried to escape
		and I did what I had to do.

				SETH
		No.
			(pause)
		That woman wouldn't of said shit if
		she had a mouthful.

				RICHARD
		Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
		wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
		became a whole different person.

				SETH
			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

				RICHARD
		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

				SETH
		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

				RICHARD
		Seth, if you were me --

				SETH
		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

				RICHARD
		Yes.

				SETH
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

				RICHARD
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

				SETH
			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

				KATE
		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

				KATE
		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

				JACOB
		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

				KATE
		It's a flop house.

				JACOB
		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

				KATE
		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

				JACOB
		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

				KATE
		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
	THUD... THUD...

				KATE
		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

				JACOB
		Watch where you're going!

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

				SCOTT
		What's this guy's problem?

				JACOB
		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

	HONK!

				JACOB
		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

				KATE
		Creepy guy.

	SETH

	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

				JACOB
		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

				RICHARD
		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

				JACOB
			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

				JACOB
		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

				SETH
		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

				RICHARD
		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

				RICHARD
		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

				JACOB
		Jacob.

				SETH
		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

				RICHARD
		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

				SETH
			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

				JACOB
		He's my son.

				SETH
		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

				JACOB
		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

				SETH
		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

				JACOB
		What's this about, money?

				SETH
		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

				SETH
			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

				KATE
		What's going on?

				RICHARD
		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

				JACOB
			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

				SETH
		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

				JACOB
		On the dresser.

				SETH
		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

	CLOSE-UP KATE
		
	She smiles at him.

				KATE
		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
		
				RICHARD
		Sure.


				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

				SETH
		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

				SETH
			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

				SETH
		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		Do you believe me?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

				JACOB
		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

				SETH
		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

				JACOB
		Not a chance.

				SETH
		Come again?

				JACOB
		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

				SETH
		Sorry, I need everybody.

				JACOB
		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

				SETH
			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

				SETH
		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

				SETH
		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

				SETH
		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
	the Lone Star night.


	INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

	Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
	and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

				KATE
		Excuse me.

	Richard zeros in on her.

				RICHARD
		What?

				KATE
		Where are you taking us?

				RICHARD
		Mexico.

				KATE
		What's in Mexico?

				RICHARD
		Mexicans.

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
	wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
	seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
	calmly.

				SETH
			(reading his driver's license)
		Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
		ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
		course it is.
			(motioning behind him)
		What are their names?

				JACOB
		Scott and Kate.

	Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

				SETH
		Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
		Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

				SETH
		Who's this?

				JACOB
		My wife.

				SETH
		Where is the little lady?

				JACOB
		In heaven.

				SETH
		She's dead?

				JACOB
		Yes, she is.

				SETH
		How'd she die?

				JACOB
		Auto wreck.

				SETH
		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

				JACOB
		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

				SETH
		Died instantly?

				JACOB
		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

				SETH
		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

				JACOB
		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

				SETH
		Is this real?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

				JACOB
		Real McCoy.

				SETH
		You're a preacher?

				JACOB
		I was a minister.

				SETH
		Was? As in not anymore?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Why'd ya quit?

				JACOB
		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

				SETH
		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

				JACOB
		How do I know you'll keep your word?

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

				JACOB
		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

				SETH
		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Didn't like it, did ya?

				JACOB
		No, I didn't.

				SETH
		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

				JACOB
		You won't let him touch her?

				SETH
		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

				SETH
		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

				SETH
			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

				JACOB
		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

				SETH
		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

				KATE
		Yeah.

				SETH
		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

				KATE
		Yeah, we got a bible.

				SETH
		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

				SETH
		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

				SETH
		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

				JACOB
		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

				SETH
		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

				SETH
		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

	Kate turns to him.

				KATE
		What?

				RICHARD
		In the room. Were you serious, or were

		bringing it up, 'cause if you really
		want me to do that for you, I will.

				KATE
		Do what?

				RICHARD
			(in a whisper)
		What you said to me in the room.

				KATE
			(whispers back)
		What did I say?

				RICHARD
			(whisper)
		You asked me if I would --

		Richard!

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		What?

	Seth and Jacob.

				SETH
		I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say

	Richard turns to Kate.

				RICHARD
			(quiet)
		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

				SETH
		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

				SETH
		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

				JACOB
		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

				SETH
		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

				JACOB
		I don't have the slightest idea.

				SETH
		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

				SCOTT
		What are you gonna do?

				JACOB
		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

				SCOTT
		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

				RICHARD
		This isn't gonna work.

				SETH
		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

				RICHARD
		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

				SETH
		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

				RICHARD
			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

				SETH
			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

				RICHARD
		What does that mean?

				SETH
			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

				RICHARD
		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

				SETH
		No, I didn't.

				RICHARD
		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

				SETH
		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

				RICHARD
		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

				SETH
			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

				RICHARD
			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

				SETH
			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

				RICHARD
			(quiet back)
		Or what?

	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		

				JACOB
		Have you forgotten about your sister?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

				JACOB
		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

				JACOB
		What about Kate?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

				JACOB
		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

				SCOTT
		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

				JACOB
		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

				SCOTT
		He's running the show.

				JACOB
		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

				BORDER GUARD
		How many with you?

				JACOB
		Just my son and I.

				BORDER GUARD
		What is your purpose in Mexico?

				JACOB
		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

				RICHARD
		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

				SETH
		This ain't the time.

				RICHARD
		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		What was that?

				JACOB
		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		You said it was just you and your son.

				JACOB
		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

				BORDER GUARD
		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

	CLOSE-UP KATE

	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

				KATE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

				KATE
		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

				KATE
		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

				BORDER GUARD
		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

								  CUT TO:

	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

				SCOTT
		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

				SETH
		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

				SETH
			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

				SETH
		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

				SETH
		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

				JACOB
		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

				SETH
		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

				KATE
			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

				SETH
		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

				JACOB
		Then?

				SETH
		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

				SETH (O.S.)
		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

				SETH
		You okay?

				RICHARD
			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

				SETH
		I don't know, you just passed out.

				RICHARD
		I did?

				SETH
		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

				RICHARD
		Really?

				SETH
		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

				RICHARD
		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

				SETH
		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

				RICHARD
		We are?

				SETH
		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

				RICHARD
		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

				SETH
		They broke when you fell.

				RICHARD
		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

				SETH
		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

				RICHARD
		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

				SETH
		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

				SETH
		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

				JACOB
		Guys! We're here.

								  CUT TO:

	A neon sign that flashes:

		THE TITTY TWISTER
		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
	TWISTER DANCERS."

	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

				CHET
		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

				SETH
			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

				SETH
		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

				JACOB
		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

				SETH
		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

				RICHARD
		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

				SETH
			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

				RICHARD
		That's what you think?

				SETH
		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

				RICHARD
		I'm lookin' scared?

				SETH
		That's what you look like.

				RICHARD
		You know what you look like?

				SETH
		No, Richie, what do I look like?

				RICHARD
		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

				SETH
		How?

				RICHARD
		Where are you right now?

				SETH
		What do you mean?

				RICHARD
		Where are you?

				SETH
		I'm here with you.

				RICHARD
		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

				SETH
		My shit is together.

				RICHARD
		It don't look together.

				SETH
		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

				RICHARD
		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

				CHET
			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

				CHET
			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

				SETH
		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

				CHET
		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
	NOSE.

	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

				SETH
		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

				RICHARD
			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

				SETH
		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

				SETH
		Whiskey!

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

				SETH
		What dya mean?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

				SETH
		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

				SETH
			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

				BIG EMILIO
			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

				SETH
		No, I'm going to count to three.

				BIG EMILIO
		Uno...

				SETH
		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

				JACOB
		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

				JACOB
		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

				SETH
		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

				RICHARD
		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

				SETH
		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

				RICHARD
		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

				SETH
		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Best in Mexico.

				SETH
		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

				RICHARD
		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

				SETH
		Who else?

				JACOB
		Pass.

				SETH
			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

				JACOB
			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

				SETH
		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll have one.

				JACOB
		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

				SETH
		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

				KATE
		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

				JACOB
		Why are you so agitated?

				SETH
		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

				JACOB
		He backed down.

				SETH
		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

				JACOB
		What are you going to do?

				SETH
			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

				JACOB
		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

				SETH
			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

				JACOB
		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

				SETH
		What did you call me?

				JACOB
		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

				SETH
		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

				SETH
		To your family.

				JACOB
		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

				JACOB
		Now, is your shit together?

				SETH
		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

				SETH
		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

				SCOTT
		Yeah, it's mine.

				SETH
		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

								  CUT TO:

	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

				SETH
		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

				SETH
			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

				RICHARD
		Yeah.

				SETH
		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

				RICHARD
			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

				SETH
		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

				SETH
		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

				JACOB
			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

				SETH
		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

				CHET
			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

				RICHARD
		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

				RICHARD
		How are you?

				SETH
		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

				SETH
		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

				RICHARD
		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

				RICHARD
			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

				SETH
		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

				WHORE
		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
	VAMPIRES.

	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

				SANTANICO
		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

				SANTANICO
		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

				BIG EMILIO
		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

				SETH
		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

				SEX MACHINE
		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

				SEX MACHINE
		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

				CHET
		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

	GULP.

	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

				CHET
		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

				CHET
		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

				FROST
		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

				SETH
		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

				RICHARD
		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

				SETH
		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

				SEX MACHINE
		He ain't your brother no more.

				SETH
		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

				JACOB
		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

				SETH
		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

				SETH
		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

				SETH
		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

				KATE
		Are you okay?

				SETH
		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

				KATE
		I'm really sorry.

				SETH
		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

				JACOB
		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

				JACOB
		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

				JACOB
		What the hell is that?

				FROST
		At first I just thought it was birds.

				SEX MACHINE
		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

				SETH
		It's bats.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

				JACOB
		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

				SEX MACHINE
		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

				SEX MACHINE
			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

				SEX MACHINE
		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

				SEX MACHINE
		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

				KATE
		Kate, what's yours?

				SEX MACHINE
		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

	WHAM !

	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

				SETH
		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

				JACOB
		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

				JACOB
		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

				SETH
		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

				SETH
		You too, preacher?

				JACOB
		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

				SETH
		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

				JACOB
		In the Winnebago.

				SETH
		In other words, no.

				SCOTT
		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

				SEX MACHINE
		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

				SETH
		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

				JACOB
		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

				SETH
		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

				FROST
		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

				SEX MACHINE
		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

				SCOTT
		That's werewolves.

				SEX MACHINE
		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

				KATE
		Does anybody have any silver?

				ALL
		No.

				KATE
		Then who cares?

				SCOTT
		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

				JACOB
		About two hours from now.

				KATE
		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

				SEX MACHINE
		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

				JACOB
		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

				SEX MACHINE
		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

				FROST
			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

				JACOB
		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

				SETH
		Aside from they're thirsty.

				FROST
		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

				JACOB
		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

				SEX MACHINE
		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

				SCOTT
		You could take their head off.

				SETH
		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

				SETH
		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

				JACOB
		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

				SETH
		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

				JACOB
		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

				KATE
		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

				FROST
		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

				JACOB
		What are you talking about?

				FROST
		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		Stop fucking saying that!

				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst!

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

				VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

				FROST
		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

				SEX MACHINE
		THIRST!

	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

				FROST
		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

				SEX MACHINE
		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

				SETH
		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

				JACOB
		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

				SETH
		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

				KATE
		We have to go back for Daddy!

				SETH
		Daddy's dead.

				KATE
		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

				SCOTT
		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

				SETH
		He needs our help!

				SCOTT
		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

				JACOB
		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

				SETH
		Did he...?

				JACOB
		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

				SETH
		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

				SETH
		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

				JACOB
			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

				KATE
		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

				JACOB
		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

				JACOB
			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

				JACOB
		What's this stuff?

				SETH
		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

				JACOB
		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

				SETH
		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

				JACOB
		Amen.

	MONTAGE

	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

				JACOB
		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

				SETH
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Kate, Scott?

				KATE
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Scott?

				SCOTT
		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

				JACOB
		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

				JACOB
		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

				KATE
		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

				JACOB
		Not good enough, swear to God.

				KATE
		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

				JACOB
		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

				SCOTT
		You don't believe in suicide.

				JACOB
		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

				JACOB
		Thank you, son.

				SETH
		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

				SETH
		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

				KATE
		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

				SETH
		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

				JACOB
		No!

				KATE
		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

				KATE
			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

				SETH
		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

				SCOTT
		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

				SETH
		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

				KATE
		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

				KATE
		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

				SCOTT
		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

				SETH
		How many bullets left, kid?

				KATE
		Not many.

				SETH
		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

				SETH
		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

				SETH
		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

				CARLOS (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

				CARLOS
			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

				CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

				SETH
		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

				CARLOS
		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

				SETH
		Have you ever been there before?

				CARLOS
		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

				SETH
		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

				CARLOS
		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

				SETH
		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

				CARLOS
		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

				SETH
		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

				CARLOS
		Twenty-eight.

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

				SETH AND CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


				CARLOS
		You like the car?

				SETH
		I said new, this is an '90.

				CARLOS
		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

				SETH
		So do I just follow you?

				CARLOS
		Yeah, follow us.


				SETH
		So let's do it.

				CARLOS
			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

				SETH
		I'm sorry.

				KATE
		Me too.

	Long pause.

				SETH
		See ya.

				KATE
		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

				KATE (O.S.)
		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

				KATE
		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

				SETH
		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.

   OPEN ON: ICE.

   We're underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through,
   heading right for us.


   EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

   ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a
   frozen lake. They SING.

                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
   share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
   water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
                  ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

   A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They
   fight it back.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)

   In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
   block of ice out of the water.

                  BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

   The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
   pulls away.

   Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
   dinky little sled then head off.

   We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
   sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the
   snowline...and descend upon...


   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.


   INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT

   ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
   up beside her.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

   Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                      (grumbling)
                  Anna, go back to sleep.

   Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.
                                                              3
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (drama queen-ish)
                  I just can't. The sky's awake, so
                  I'm awake, so we have to play.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  ...Go play by yourself.

   Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

   Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
   an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
   eyelids.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (mischievously)
                  Do you want to build a snowman?

   Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.


   INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

   Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Come on, come on, come on, come on.

   Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.


   INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT

   The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Do the magic! Do the magic!

   Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
   burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
   Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
   and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
   flakes in her palms and mouth.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  This is amazing!

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Watch this!

   Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
   suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
   slides off, laughing.
                                                              4

   PLAY MONTAGE:

   -Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
   together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                      (goofy voice)
                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

   Anna jumps up and hugs him.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  I love you, Olaf.

   -Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
   propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

   -The girls slide down snowbanks together!

   -Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

                              YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Catch me!

   Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.

                              YOUNG ELSA
                  Gotcha!

   Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (jumping faster)
                  Again! Again!

                             YOUNG ELSA
                      (struggling to keep up)
                  Slow down!

   Elsa suddenly slips.

   Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
   down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

                              YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  ANNA!

   Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
   Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  MAMA! PAPA!

   The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.
                                                                     5

   The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight
   of the room.

                            KING
                  Elsa, what have you done? This is
                  getting out of hand!

                            QUEEN
                      (seeing Anna)
                  Anna!

   The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

                            ELSA
                  It was an accident. I'm sorry,
                  Anna.

                            QUEEN
                      (about Anna)
                  She's ice cold.

                            KING
                  ...I know where we have to go.

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:


   INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

   The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
   inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles
   to a page with an ancient map.


   EXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out
   of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a
   trail of ice behind them.


   EXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT

   A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark
   woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the
   girls, leaving the wake of ice.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Ice?

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:

   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice.

                            YOUNG KRISTOFF
                  Faster, Sven!


   EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT

   Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They
   hide behind a rock and peek out.

   Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds
   the still unconscious Anna.

                            KING
                  Please, help. My daughter!

   Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
   them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!

   But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then
   unfold, revealing bright faces.

                               YOUNG KRISTOFF
                  Trolls...?

   The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA.

                            BULDA
                  Shush. I'm trying to listen.

   She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
   close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

                            BULDA (CONT'D)
                  Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

   Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.
   They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but
   determined. He nods respectfully to the king.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  Your Majesty.
                      (referring to Elsa)
                  Born with the powers or cursed?

                            KING
                  Born. And they're getting stronger.

   Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She
   does. He examines her.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                      (about Anna)
                  You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
                  The heart is not so easily changed,
                  but the head can be persuaded.

                            KING
                  Do what you must.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  I recommend we remove all magic,
                  even memories of magic to be
                  safe.... But don't worry, I'll
                  leave the fun.

   Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's
   head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand
   Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
   memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
   nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
   girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in
   her head.

                            GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  She will be okay.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  But she won't remember I have
                  powers?

                            KING
                  It's for the best.

                             PABBIE
                  Listen to me, Elsa, your power will
                  only grow.

   As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
   silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  There is beauty in your magic....
                  But also great danger.

   The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes.

                           PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  You must learn to control it.

   In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human
   figures to panic and attack Elsa.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  Fear will be your enemy.
                                                                     8

   Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King
   wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively.

                  No. We'll protect her. She can
                  learn to control it. I'm sure.

   Over the King's words we...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

                  Until then, we'll lock the gates.
                  We'll reduce the staff. We will
                  limit her contact with people and
                  keep her powers hidden from
                  everyone... including Anna.

   -The castle shutters close.

   -Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears.

   -Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new
   room. Anna watches, confused and sad.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


   INT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY

   We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the
   window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes
   down the hall.


   INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY

   Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS.

                     "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?
                  COME ON LET'S GO AND PLAY.

   Anna peeks under the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE.
                  COME OUT THE DOOR.
                  IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GONE AWAY.
                                                                 9

   -INT. ANNA'S ROOM -- Anna plays with two dolls, gives up, sad.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  WE USED TO BE BEST BUDDIES
                  AND NOW WE'RE NOT.
                  I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY.

   -ELSA'S DOOR. Anna peeks through the key hole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -Anna calls through the keyhole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN.

                            YOUNG ELSA (O.S.)
                  Go away, Anna.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (hearbroken)
                  ...OKAY BYE.

   -BEHIND THE DOOR -- DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out,
   longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.

   -LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands.

                            KING
                  The gloves will help.

   He pats her gloved hand.

                            KING (CONT'D)
                  See? You're good....
                      (starting their mantra)
                  Conceal it.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Don't feel it.

                            YOUNG ELSA & KING
                  Don't let it show.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY. Anna, now 9, knocks on
   Elsa's door.

                            ANNA (9)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -INT. HALLWAY -- DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for
   two in the hall by standing on the back seat.
                                                               10

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  OR RIDE OUR BIKE AROUND THE HALL?
                  I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE...

   -INT. PORTRAIT ROOM -- DAY. Anna runs around the portrait
   room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  I'VE STARTED TALKING TO
                  THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS.

   Anna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the
   painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  Hang in there, Joan.

   -INT. EMPTY LIBRARY -- DAY. Looks like no one's around.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY
                  ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS.

   But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather
   clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY.

   Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics.
   The entire wall is frozen behind her.

                            ELSA (12)
                  I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

                            KING
                  Getting upset only makes it worse.

   The King goes to hug her.

                            ELSA (12)
                  No. Don't touch me. I don't want to
                  hurt you.

   He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness.

   -INT. LIBRARY -- DAY. Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsa's
   room without stopping.
                                                                11

   -INT. KING AND QUEEN'S QUARTERS -- DAY. Anna runs into the
   room and throws herself into her parents' arms.

                            TEEN ANNA
                  See you in two weeks.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa curtsies in front of her
   parents, formally, not touching them.

                            TEEN ELSA
                  Do you have to go?

                            KING
                  You'll be fine, Elsa.

   -EXT. DOCKS -- DAY. The King and Queen leave on a ship.

   -EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in
   a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves.

   -INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is
   covered in mourning cloth.

   -EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her
   people, beside burial stones.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning
   clothes, approaches and knocks.

                            ANNA
                      (singing)
                  Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
                  PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN

                  I'M RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU.
                  PLEASE LET ME IN.

   Anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.
                  IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.
                  WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
                      (weak, internal)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   We move through the door...

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same
   pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang
   in the air, suspended by grief.

                                                        FADE OUT.

   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING

   A new dawn rises over the fjords.

   Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out.

                            DOCK MASTER
                  Welcome to Arendelle!

   A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in
   his bunad jacket.

                            BOY
                  Why do I have to wear this?

                            MOTHER
                  Because the Queen has come of age.
                  It's Coronation Day!

                            BOY
                  That's not my fault.

   They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
   chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and
   Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
   nuzzles Kristoff's chest.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What do you want, Sven?

   Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  Give me a snack.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  What's the magic word?

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  Please!

   Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it
   to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Hey, hey, hey! Share!

   Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself,
   not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber.

   We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who
   rush towards the castle.
                                                              13

                            PERSI
                  I can't believe they're finally
                  opening up the gates!

                            AGGIE
                  And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

   They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his
   shoes to "enhance" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close
   behind him.

                            DUKE
                  Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious
                  trade partner. Open those gates so
                  I may unlock your secrets and
                  exploit your riches.
                      (catching himself)
                  ...Did I just say that out loud?

   We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle
   gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.

                            IRISHMAN
                  Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see
                  the Queen and the Princess. I bet
                  they're absolutely lovely.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  I bet they are beautiful.

   We move past them, to a particular castle window.

   Anna sits up. She's got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts.
   Pulls a hair from her mouth.

   She falls back asleep while sitting. She snores. Her head
   drops, startling her awake.

                  Who is it?

                            ANNA
                  My sister's cor-neration...

   One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress.
   She bolts, wide awake in excitement.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Coronation Day! Ha ha!

   EXT. CASTLE HALL -- DAY

   Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress.
   She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle
   and bustle of preparations, she can't help but SING.

                       "For the First Time in Forever"

   evidence.

                  BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE!

   -Anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's
   pulley. She raises herself up to see the ships arriving.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

                  DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,

                  (GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?

   -Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. She
   acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-
                  FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.
                  THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.

   -She notices the bust of a man across the room.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (google-eyed)
                  I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,

                  I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY

                  WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE.
                  NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.

   The bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake.

   -Anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the
   furniture, and interacts with the paintings.
                                                               16

   Elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. She
   takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a
   candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.

                  MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE
                  AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

   The candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them
   back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY.

   We cut between Anna's excitement and Elsa's nerves.

                            ANNA
                  IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY!

                            ANNA
                  THE GATE!!!

   -Finally, the gates are open! Anna moves through the crowd,
   admiring the people around her.

   -Anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW,

   -Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!

   She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off
   of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the
   horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.

                               ANNA (CONT'D)
                         (frustrated)
                  Hey!

                            HANS
                  I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

   The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.

                            ANNA
                      (gentler)
                  Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

                            HANS
                  Are you sure?

                            ANNA
                  Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I
                  was going. But I'm okay.

   He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I'm great, actually.

                            HANS
                  Oh, thank goodness.

   He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps
   her to her feet.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                      (bowing)
                  Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

                      (curtseying)
                  Princess Anna of Arendelle.

                            HANS
                  Princess...? My Lady.

   He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,
   curling his hoof up and out of the boat.

   The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

                            ANNA
                  Hi...again.

   The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.
   Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.

                            HANS
                  Oh boy.

                            ANNA
                  Ha. This is awkward. Not you're
                  awkward, but just because we're--
                  I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.
                      (did she just say that?)
                  Wait, what?

   Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.

                            HANS
                  I'd like to formally apologize for
                  hitting the Princess of Arendelle
                  with my horse...and for every
                  moment after.

                            ANNA
                  No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT
                  Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my
                  sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash!

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (to Hans)
                  But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

                              HANS
                  Just you?

   Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She
   doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's
   handsomeness.

                            ANNA
                  ...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I
                  better go. I have to...I better go.

   She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Bye!

   As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves
   too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.

                              HANS
                  Oh no.

   The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down
   in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.

                                                         CUT TO:

   INT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY

   Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She
   peeks out to the audience.

   Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes.

   The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are
   presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them.

                            BISHOP
                      (a whisper)
                  Your Majesty, the gloves.

   Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves,
   places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb
   and scepter, then turns to the people.

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)
                      (formal, in Old Norse)

   The scepter and orb start to freeze over.

                            BISHOP (CONT'D)
                  ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

                            CROWD
                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back
   down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks
   up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.

                                                        CUT TO:


   INT. GREAT HALL -- NIGHT

   Springy music fills the Great Hall. Guests dance. Eat. Laugh.

   TRUMPETS SOUND.

                            KAI
                      (announcing)
                  Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

   Elsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She
   stands under a formal awning.

                            KAI (CONT'D)
                  Princess Anna of Arendelle!

   Anna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over
   to stand right next to Elsa.

                            ANNA
                  Here? Are you sure?

   She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.

                            ELSA
                  ...Hi.

                            ANNA
                  Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

                            ELSA
                  ...You look beautiful.

                  Thank you. You look beautifuller. I
                  mean, not fuller. You don't look
                  fuller, but more beautiful.

                               ELSA
                  Thank you.

   They look out at the celebration.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  So, this is what a party looks
                  like?

                            ANNA
                  It's warmer than I thought.

                            ELSA
                  And what is that amazing smell?

   They both close their eyes and inhale.

                            ANNA AND ELSA (TOGETHER)
                  ...Chocolate.

   Their eyes pop open. They laugh.

   Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She
   wants to say so much, but she can't think of where to start.
   Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts.

                            KAI
                  Your Majesty. The Duke of
                  Weaseltown.

                            DUKE
                  Weselton. The Duke of Weselton.
                      (to Elsa)
                  Your Majesty, as your closest
                  partner in trade, it seems only
                  fitting that I offer you your first
                  dance as queen.

   The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and
   a deep bow.

                            DUKE (CONT'D)
                      (whispers to himself)
                  One, two, three. Jump.

   As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward.
   Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself.

                            ELSA
                      (to the Duke)
                  Thank you...only I don't dance.
                                                               22

                      (offended)
                  Oh...?

                            ELSA
                  But my sister does.

                            ANNA
                  What?

                            DUKE
                  Lucky you....

                            ANNA
                  Oh, I don't think--

   The Duke grabs Anna's arm and yanks her away before she can
   protest.

                             DUKE
                  If you swoon, let me know, I'll
                  catch you.

   Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately.

                            ELSA
                  Sorry.

   OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but he's just
   awful. Anna tries to make the best of it.

                            DUKE
                  Like an agile peacock... CLUCK-
                  CLUGGLE-CLUCK!

   He lands on her feet.

                            ANNA
                  Ow. Ow.

                            DUKE
                  Speaking of, so great to have the
                  gates open. Why did they shut them
                  in the first place? Do you know the
                  reason? Hmm?

   He gets in her face, suspicious.

                            ANNA
                  ...No.
                                                                   23

                            DUKE
                  Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't
                  call me the little dipper for
                  nothing.

   He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely
   hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks.

                            DUKE (CONT'D)
                      (groove fully on)
                  Like a chicken...with the face of a
                  monkey...I fly.

                                                        JUMP CUT TO:


   MOMENTS LATER...

   Anna limps back to Elsa.

                            DUKE (O.S.)
                  Let me know when you're ready for
                  another round, M'Lady.

                            ELSA
                  Well, he was sprightly.

                            ANNA
                      (rubbing her sore feet)
                  Especially for a man in heels.

                            ELSA
                  Are you okay?

                            ANNA
                      (loving Elsa's attention)
                  I've never been better. This is so
                  nice. I wish it could be like this
                  all the time.

                             ELSA
                      (sincere)
                  Me too....

   But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  But it can't.

                            ANNA
                  Why not? If--

                            ELSA
                  It just can't.
                                                                24

   Anna's smile drops. She tries not to get emotional.

                            ANNA
                  Excuse me for a minute.

   She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened.

   Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing man's
   butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches
   her. He smiles perfectly.

                  Hans.

   He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts
   her up and leads her in a romantic dance.

                  I often had the whole parlor to
                  myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

   She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs.

                      (about her white streak)
                  What's this?

                            ANNA
                  I was born with it, although I
                  dreamt I was kissed by a troll.

                               HANS
                  I like it.

   EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT

   Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake.

                            ANNA
                  Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.

   They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.

                            ANNA(CONT'D)
                  Okay wait, wait. So you have how
                  many brothers?

                            HANS
                  Twelve older brothers. Three of
                  them pretended I was invisible...
                  literally...for two years.

                            ANNA
                  That's horrible.

                            HANS
                  It's what brothers do.

                            ANNA
                  ...And sisters. Elsa and I were
                  really close when we were little.
                  But then, one day she just shut me
                  out, and I never knew why.

   He takes her hand. Leans in close.

                            HANS
                  I would never shut you out.

                            ANNA
                  Okay, can I just say something
                  crazy?

                            HANS
                  I love crazy.

                  I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE
                  TO FIND MY OWN PLACE.
                  AND MAYBE IT'S THE PARTY TALKING,
                  OR THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE.

                  AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER
                  KNOWN BEFORE.

   They jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door.

   They come out on top of one of the castle's towers.

                            BOTH (CONT'D)
                  LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!

   Cut to them sliding across an empty hallway in their socks.

   They hop up on the castle roof and watch a shooting star.

                  I MEAN IT'S CRAZY.

   They slide down the back of the roof out of sight.

   We next find them strutting on a bridge ledge.

                  Jinx.. . .jinx again.

   Are they doing the robot? No. They're imitating the

   Anna and Hans dance on top of the lighthouse and cast dancing
   shadows across the sails of ships in the docks.

   They climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom.

   Anna raises up her hands to frame the moon. Hans puts his
   hands on top of hers. Together their hands form a heart.

   INT. BALL -- NIGHT

   Anna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow.

                            ANNA
                  Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just
                  get around you there? Thank you.
                  Oh, there she is. Elsa!

   Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um.
                  May I present Prince Hans of the
                  Southern Isles.

                            HANS
                      (bowing)
                  Your Majesty.

   Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey.

                            ANNA
                  We would like--

                            HANS

                  Well, we haven't worked out all the
                  details ourselves. We'll need a few
                  days to plan the ceremony. Of
                  course we'll have soup, roast, and
                  ice cream and then--
                  Wait. Would we live here?

                  Oh, we can invite all twelve of

                  What? No, no, no, no, no.

                  Of course we have the room. I don't
                  know. Some of them must--

                            ELSA
                  Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers
                  are staying here. No one is getting
                  married.

                            ANNA
                  Wait, what?

                            ELSA
                  May I talk to you, please. Alone.

   Anna sees Hans's worried face. Hooks arms with him.

                            ANNA
                  No. Whatever you have to say, you-
                  you can say to both of us.

                            ELSA
                  Fine. You can't marry a man you
                  just met.

                            ANNA
                  You can if it's true love.

                            ELSA
                  Anna, what do you know about true
                  love?

                            ANNA
                  More than you. All you know is how
                  to shut people out.

                            ELSA
                  You asked for my blessing, but my
                  answer is no. Now, excuse me.

                             ELSA
                      (flustered)
                  No, you may not. And I-I think you
                  should go.

   Elsa walks away. As she passes the Royal Handler--

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  The party is over. Close the gates.

                            ANNA
                  What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

   Anna grabs Elsa's hand. She pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa
   gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.

                            ELSA
                  Give me my glove!

   Anna holds the glove away from Elsa.

                            ANNA
                      (desperate)
                  Elsa, please. Please. I can't live
                  like this anymore.

   Elsa fights tears.

                             ELSA
                      (weak)
                  ...Then leave.

   Elsa sees Anna's hurt face. It's too much. She can't hold it
   in. She turns and rushes away.

                            ANNA
                      (heartbroken)
                  ...What did I ever do to you?!

   The party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters.

                            ELSA
                  Enough, Anna.

                            ANNA
                  No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!
                  Why do you shut the world out?!
                  What are you so afraid of?!

   Ice shoots from Elsa's hand, spikes across the floor! Guests
   cry out in shock, back away.

                            DUKE
                      (ducking behind his men)
                  ...Sorcery. I knew there was

                             ANNA
                  Elsa...?

   Elsa rushes out of the room.

   EXT. COURTYARD -- NIGHT

   Elsa bursts out of the castle door. The CITIZENS CHEER!

                            CROWD
                  There she is. Your Majesty! Long
                  live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come
                  drink with us.

   Elsa ducks through the crowd, holding her bare hand.

                            BOWING TOWNSMAN
                  Queen Elsa.

                            TOWNSWOMAN WITH BABY
                  Your Majesty? Are you all right?

   Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain,
   grabs its edge. The waters freeze at her touch.

   GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.

   The Duke and thugs come out the door.

                            DUKE
                  There she is! Stop her!

                             ELSA
                      (to the Duke)
                  Please, just stay away from me.
                  Stay away!

   Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the
   staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall.

                            DUKE
                  Monster.... Monster!

   The crowd panics.

   A snowstorm begins. Elsa flees.

   Anna runs out of the palace doors, carrying the glove.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa!

   Hans follows closely behind her.

   GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to
   the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet.

   Anna calls to her from the gates.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Elsa! Wait, please!

   Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively
   steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks
   into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Elsa, stop!

   Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls.

                            HANS
                  Anna!

   Hans rushes to Anna's side.

   Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just
   scrambles into the mountains.

                            ANNA
                  No.

                            HANS
                      (shocked)
                  Look.... The fjord.

   The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking
   the ships in place.


   INT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- NIGHT

   Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd.

                            CROWD WALLAH

                              ANNA
                  No.

   Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.

                            DUKE
                  Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!
                  The Queen has cursed this land! She

                      (to his thugs)
                  You have to go after her.

   Anna rushes up to the Duke.

                              ANNA
                  Wait, no!

   The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna.

                            DUKE
                  You! Is there sorcery in you, too?
                  Are you a monster, too?

                            ANNA
                  No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

                            HANS
                  That's right she is...

                            DUKE
                  She nearly killed me.

                  It was an accident. She was scared.
                  She didn't mean it. She didn't mean
                  any of this.... Tonight was my
                  fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one
                  that needs to go after her.

                            DUKE
                  Yes. Fine. Do.

                            HANS

                  Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring
                  her back, and I'll make this right.

   The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak.

                            HANS
                  I'm coming with you.

   She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her.

   The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a
   blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves...


   EXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest
   peak. It's Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches
   her breath and sings...

                                "Let It Go"

                            ELSA
                  THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE
                  ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT,
                  NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN.
                  A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION
                  AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN.

                  THE WIND IS HOWLING
                  LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE.
                  COULDN'T KEEP IT IN,
                  HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED. . .

                  DON'T LET THEM IN,

                  DON'T LET THEM KNOW.
                  WELL, NOW THEY KNOW.

   Elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
                  CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.

   Elsa creates a snowman, just like the one she made with Anna
   when they were children.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO. LET IT GO.

                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON.
                  THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

   Elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind.

                  MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL.
                  AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME
                  CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL.
                  IT'S TIME TO SEE
                  WHAT I CAN DO,
                  TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH.
                  NO RIGHT, NO WRONG,
                  NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!

   Elsa creates ice steps and climbs them.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
                  I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY.
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
                  YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY.
                  HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.

   Elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET THE STORM RAGE ON....

   In a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on
   ice beams, builds walls, archways, a glistening chandelier,
   and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR
                  INTO THE GROUND.
                  MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN
                  FRACTALS ALL AROUND.
                  AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE
                  AN ICY BLAST-

   Standing firmly in her mighty ice palace, Elsa removes her
   crown and throws it.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  I'M NEVER GOING BACK,
                  (back to resolve)
                  THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!

   She takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
                  AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN.
                  LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

   The sun rises. Elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into
   the light. She's free.
                                                                  38

                  THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

   She turns and slams her ice palace door on us.

                  Of course, none of this would have
                  happened if she'd just told me her
                  secret...ha...she's a stinker.

   A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna
   goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up.
   Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.
                  No. No. No.... Oooo-kay.

   He doesn't come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning
   conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree
   snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.

                  in white sand and warm --

   She sees smoke rising up in the distance.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Fire! WHOA!

   Anna goes tumbling down the hill. She lands with a crash in
   an icy stream at the bottom.

   EXT. A SMALL BUILDING AND STABLE -- NIGHT

   Anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff. She
   shakes the snow off a sign and reads:

                  Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

   Snow drops off a smaller sign. She reads it, happily.

                  Ooh! And Sauna...


   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST & SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen

   around, sees only summer supplies.

                             OAKEN (O.S.)
                  Hoo hoo.

   Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind

                  That would be in our winter
                  department.

   The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a
   lonely pair of boots.

                            ANNA
                  Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has
                  another young woman, the Queen
                  perhaps, I don't know, passed
                  through here?

   She brings the clothes and boots to the counter.

                            OAKEN
                  Only one crazy enough to be out in
                  this storm is you, dear?

   The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a
   man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF.

                            OAKEN (CONT'D)
                  You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo.
                  Big summer blow out.

   Kristoff walks right up to Anna.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (in her face)
                  Carrots.

                            ANNA
                  Huh?

                            KRISTOFF
                  Behind you.

                            ANNA
                  Oh, right. Excuse me.

   Anna moves out of Kristoff's way. He grabs a bunch of
   carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the
   place, gathering other supplies.

                            OAKEN
                      (to Kristoff)
                  A real howler in July, yah? Where
                  ever could it be coming from?

                            KRISTOFF
                  The North Mountain.

                            ANNA
                      (to herself)
                  North Mountain.

   Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on
   his fingertips.

                            OAKEN
                  That'll be forty.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Forty? No, ten.

                            OAKEN
                      (sweet as pie)
                  Oh dear, that's no good. See these
                  are from our winter stock, where
                  supply and demand have a big
                  problem.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You want to talk about a supply and
                  demand problem? I sell ice for a
                  living.

   Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of
   ice on his sled, covered in snow.

                            ANNA
                  Ooh, that's a rough business to be
                  in right now. I mean, that is
                  really...
                      (he shoots her a look)
                  Ahem. That's unfortunate.

                            OAKEN
                  Still forty. But I will throw in a
                  visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!
                  Hi, family.

   Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through
   the window of the steaming sauna.

                             NAKED FAMILY
                  Hoo hoo!

                            KRISTOFF
                  ...Ten's all I got. Help me out.

                            OAKEN
                      (isolating the carrots)
                  Ten will get you this and no more.

   Kristoff seethes. Stalemate.
                                                               42
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            ANNA
                  Okay, just tell me one thing; what
                  was happening on the North
                  Mountain? Did it seem magical?

   Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Yes! Now, back up while I deal with
                  this crook here.

   Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.

                            OAKEN
                  What did you call me?


   EXT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!

   Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.

                             OAKEN
                  Bye bye.

   Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven,
   canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

   Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees
   something. He points to a dilapidated barn.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  But I did find us a place to sleep.
                  And it's free.


   INT. WANDERING OAKEN'S TRADING POST AND SAUNA -- NIGHT

   Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he
   squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again.

                            OAKEN
                      (teddy bear)
                  I'm sorry about this violence. I
                  will add a quart of lutefisk, so
                  we'll have good feelings. Just the
                  outfit and boots, yah?
                                                                 43

   Anna looks between Kristoff's supplies and the door.

                                                           CUT TO:


   INT. OAKEN'S STABLES - NIGHT

   Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his
   lute and singing to (and for) Sven.

                    "Reindeer(s) are Better than People"

                            KRISTOFF
                  REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.
                  SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

                             KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                      (throwing his voice)
                  YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE
                  YOU & CHEAT YOU.
                  EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.
                      (speaking)
                  Oh, thanks, Buddy.
                      (singing, as Kristoff)
                  BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN
                  REINDEERS.
                  SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?

                      (As Sven)
                  THAT'S ONCE AGAIN TRUE,
                  FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.
                      (As Kristoff)
                  YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.
                      (As Sven)
                  GOOD NIGHT.
                      (As Kristoff)
                  DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE.

   The door opens. Anna enters.

                               ANNA
                  Nice duet.

   Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Oh, it's just you. What do you
                  want?

                            ANNA
                  I want you to take me up the North
                  Mountain.
                                                                   44

                            KRISTOFF
                  I don't take people places.

   He lays back down, closes his eyes.

                            ANNA
                  Let me rephrase that...

   A sack of supplies lands in Kristoff's lap.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Umph.

   He sits up. Looks in the bag.

                            ANNA
                  Take me up the North Mountain....
                  Please.

   He eyes her. He clearly doesn't take orders.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Look, I know how to stop this
                  winter.

   He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.

                            KRISTOFF
                  We leave at dawn.... And you forgot
                  the carrots for Sven.

   A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Ugh!

                            ANNA
                  Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I
                  didn't--
                      (catching herself)
                  We leave now. Right now.

   She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed,
   Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff
   has a bite, contemplating.

                                                        SLAM CUT TO:


   EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGH -- NIGHT

   Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled,
   which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits
   beside him.
                                                            45
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            KRISTOFF
                      (trying to scare Anna)
                  Hang on! We like to go fast!

                            ANNA
                      (fearless)
                  I like fast!

   Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.

   He pushes her feet down.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  This is fresh lacquer. Seriously,
                  were you raised in a barn?

   Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back
   and hits Anna in the face.

                            ANNA
                      (grossed out)
                  Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

   She wipes off her face.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So tell me, what made the Queen go
                  all ice-crazy?

                            ANNA
                  ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I
                  got engaged but then she freaked
                  out because I'd only just met him,
                  you know, that day. And she said
                  she wouldn't bless the marriage--

                            KRISTOFF
                  Wait. You got engaged to someone
                  you just met?

                            ANNA
                  Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she
                  got mad and then she tried to walk
                  away, and I grabbed her glove--

                            KRISTOFF
                  Hang on. You mean to tell me you
                  got engaged to someone you just
                  met?!
                                                            46
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            ANNA
                  Yes. Pay attention. But the thing
                  is she wore the gloves all the
                  time, so I just thought, maybe she
                  has a thing about dirt.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Didn't your parents ever warn you
                  about strangers?

   Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.

                            ANNA
                  Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a
                  stranger.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Oh yeah? What's his last name?

                            ANNA
                  ...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

                            KRISTOFF
                  What's his favorite food?

                            ANNA
                  ...Sandwiches.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Best friend's name?

                            ANNA
                  Probably John.

                               KRISTOFF
                  Eye color.

                               ANNA
                  Dreamy.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Foot size...?

                            ANNA
                  Foot size doesn't matter.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Have you had a meal with him yet?
                  What if you hate the way he eats?
                  What if you hate the way he picks
                  his nose?

                  Picks his nose?

                            KRISTOFF
                  And eats it.

                            ANNA
                  Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.

                            KRISTOFF
                  All men do it.

                             ANNA
                  Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's
                  true love.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Doesn't sound like true love.

                            ANNA
                  Are you some sort of love expert?

                            KRISTOFF
                  No. But I have friends who are.

                            ANNA
                  You have friends who are love
                  experts.... I'm not buying it.

   Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (to Anna)
                  Stop talking.

                            ANNA
                  No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--

   Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.

                            KRISTOFF
                  I mean it. SHHH.

   Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
   Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its
   light reflects off...EYES. Several.

                            KRISTOFF(CONT'D)
                  Sven, go. Go!

   Sven takes off.

                            ANNA
                  What are they?

                            KRISTOFF
                  Wolves.

   Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into
   the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.

                            ANNA
                  Wolves. What do we do?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I've got this. You just...don't
                  fall off and don't get eaten.

                            ANNA
                  But I wanna help.

                             KRISTOFF
                  No.

                             ANNA
                  Why not?

                             KRISTOFF
                  Because I don't trust your
                  judgement.

                            ANNA
                  Excuse me?!

   A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Who marries a man she just met?

   Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.

                            ANNA
                  It's true love!

   He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a
   wolf away.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (shocked)
                  Whoa.

   Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.
   The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.

                            ANNA
                  Christopher!

   Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the
   sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's Kristoff!
                                                               49

   A wolf jumps on Kristoff's back.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  AH!

   Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.

                            ANNA
                  Duck!

   Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The
   blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You almost set me on fire!

   Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.

                            ANNA
                  But I didn't.

   Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Get ready to jump, Sven!

                            KRISTOFF
                  You don't tell him what to do!

   Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I do!

   Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness
   from the sled.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Jump, Sven!

   Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.

   Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.

   Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.

   Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He
   leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.

   He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his
   hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below
   and burst into flames.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (shocked sadness)
                  ...But I just paid it off.

   Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but
   it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Uh-oh. No, no, no.

   To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  AH! NO, NO, NO!

   The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.

                             ANNA (O.S.)
                  Grab on!

   Kristoff grabs on.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Pull, Sven! Pull!

   REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.
   Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.

   Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at
   the burning sled.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and
                  everything in it.

   Kristoff groans.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  And I understand if you don't want
                  to help me anymore.

   Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Of course I don't want to help her
                  anymore. In fact, this whole thing
                  has ruined me for helping anyone
                  ever again.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  But she'll die on her own.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
                  I can live with that.
                                                                51

   Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong
   way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  But you won't get your new sled if
                  she's dead.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (knowing he's got a point)
                  ...You know sometimes I really
                  don't like you.

   Sven licks Kristoff happily.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SELF) (CONT'D)
                      (to Anna)
                  Hold up. We're coming?!

                  You are?!
                      (catching herself)
                  I mean, sure. I'll let you tag
                  along.

   Kristoff, Sven and Anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain.

   EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST CLEARING -- DAY

   As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of
   something far below.

                               ANNA
                  Arendelle.

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's completely frozen.

                            ANNA
                  ...But it'll be fine. Elsa will
                  thaw it.

                               KRISTOFF
                  Will she?

                  ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to
                  the North Mountain?

   She points straight ahead.

                            KRISTOFF
                  More like this way.

   He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.

   INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The
   hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks
   them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.

                             ANNA
                  I never knew winter could be so
                  beautiful.

   Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that
   voice OLAF.

                            OLAF (O.S.)
                  YEAH...It really is beautiful,
                  isn't it? But it's so white. You
                  know, how about a little color?
                  Must we bleach the joy out of it
                  all? I'm thinking like maybe some
                  crimson, chartreuse...

   While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the
   source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually
   be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in
   branches, just as baffled as they are.

   In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind
   them.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  How `bout yellow--no, not yellow.
                  Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.

   He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him.
   How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Am I right?
                                                               53

   Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olaf's head,
   sending it flying off his body and into Kristoff's arms.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                        (cheery, to Kristoff)
                  Hi!

                            KRISTOFF
                  You're creepy.

   Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a
   game of hot potato.

                            ANNA
                  I don't want it!

                            KRISTOFF
                  Backatchya!

                            OLAF
                  Please don't drop me.

                              ANNA
                  Don't!

                            KRISTOFF
                  Come on, it's just a head.

                              ANNA
                  No!

   Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.

                            OLAF (O.S.)
                  All right, we got off to a bad
                  start.

                            ANNA
                  Ew, ew, the body!

   Anna slams Olaf's head back on the body, upside down. Olaf
   smiles happily, then looks confused.

                            OLAF
                  Wait, what am I looking at right
                  now? Why are you hanging off the
                  earth like a bat?

                            ANNA
                      (sympathetic)
                  ...Okay. Wait one second.

   Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.
                                                               54

                            OLAF
                  Oooh! Thank you!

                            ANNA
                  You're welcome.

                            OLAF
                  Now I'm perfect.

   She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea.

                            ANNA
                  Well, almost.

   She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as
   Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the
   way through his head.

                            OLAF
                  Woo! Head rush!

                            ANNA
                  Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was
                  just.... Are you okay?

   Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his
   eyes. He lights up.

                            OLAF
                  Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!
                  I've always wanted a nose.
                      (going cross-eyed to look
                       at his tiny nose)
                  So cute. It's like a little baby
                  unicorn.

   Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking
   out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  What? Hey! Whoa.
                      (seeing his now big nose)
                  Oh, I love it even more! Hah....
                  All right, let's start this thing
                  over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I
                  like warm hugs.

   Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It
   takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.

                            ANNA
                  Olaf?...That's right, Olaf.

                  ...And you are?

                            ANNA
                  Oh, um...I'm Anna.

                            OLAF
                  And who's the funky-looking donkey
                  over there?

                            ANNA
                  That's Sven.

                            OLAF
                  Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

                               ANNA
                  ...Sven.

   Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused.

                            OLAF
                  Oh. They're--oh, okay....
                      (accepting it)
                  Makes things easier for me.

   Sven tries to bite Olaf's nose.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss
                  my nose.
                      (gushes)
                  I like you, too!

                            ANNA
                  Olaf, did Elsa build you?

                               OLAF
                  Yeah. Why?

   Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olaf's twig arms off, studies
   it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm.

                            ANNA
                  Do you know where she is?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (studying the arm)
                  Fascinating...

                            ANNA
                  Do you think you could show us the
                  way?

                               OLAF
                  Yeah. Why?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (bending the arm)
                  How does this work?

   Olaf's dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.

                             OLAF
                  Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus
                  here.
                      (to Anna)
                  Yeah, why?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to
                  bring back summer.

                            OLAF
                      (shocked)
                  Summer?
                      (sinking into wistfulness)
                  Oh, I don't know why but I've
                  always loved the idea of summer,
                  and sun, and all things hot.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Really? I'm guessing you don't have
                  much experience with heat.

                            OLAF
                  Nope. But sometimes I like to close
                  my eyes and imagine what it'd be
                  like when summer does come.

   OLAF'S FANTASY WORLD -- PERFECT SUMMER DAY

   Olaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining
   behind him. He SINGS.

                                "In Summer"

   -Olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub.

                  THE HOT AND THE COLD ARE BOTH SO
                  INTENSE / PUT `EM TOGETHER, IT JUST

   He stops at a puddle, looks down at it. Smiles. Hops over it.

   -Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out. He
   relaxes and stares at the blue sky.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  WHEN LIFE GETS ROUGH I LIKE TO HOLD

   Sven, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf have a picnic.

                               OLAF
                  IN SUMMER!

   Olaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to:

   REALITY. He then straightens up and smiles.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's
                  go bring back summer!

   Olaf grabs Anna's hand and pulls her along up the mountain.

                      (laughing)

   Sven hops along, happily following them. Kristoff watches all
   of them like they're nuts.

   EXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE -- DAY

   A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around
   weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and
   guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile.

                            CITIZEN ONE
                  No. No. You've got the bark facing
                  down. The bark needs to be face-up.

                            CITIZEN TWO
                  Bark down is drier.

                               CITIZEN ONE
                  Bark up.

                               CITIZEN TWO
                  Bark down.

                               CITIZEN ONE
                  Bark up.

   Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd.

                            HANS
                  Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

                            GERDA
                  Arendelle is indebted to you, Your
                  Highness.

                            HANS
                  The castle is open. There's soup
                  and hot glögg in the Great Hall.

   He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  Here. Pass these out.

   Just then the Duke approaches Hans.

                            DUKE
                  Prince Hans, are we just expected
                  to sit here and freeze while you
                  give away all of Arendelle's
                  tradable goods?

                  Princess Anna has given her orders

                                                               60

                            DUKE
                  And that's another thing; has it
                  dawned on you that your princess
                  may be conspiring with a wicked
                  sorceress to destroy us all?

   Hans's nice eyes turn to threatening slits.

                            HANS
                  Do not question the Princess. She
                  left me in charge, and I will not
                  hesitate to protect Arendelle from
                  treason.

                            DUKE
                      (flabbergasted, offended)
                  Treason?!

   Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse. It
   returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins.

                            HANS
                  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

                            CROWD
                      (various)
                  Princess Anna's horse. What
                  happened to her? Where is she?

   Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain. He sees
   all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him.

                            HANS
                  ...Princess Anna is in trouble.
                      (calling out)
                  I need volunteers to go with me to
                  find her!

   Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush
   up to offer their services.

                            DUKE
                  I volunteer two men, my Lord!
                      (quietly to his thugs)
                  Be prepared for anything, and
                  should you encounter the Queen, you
                  are to put an end to this winter.

   His two thugs sneer.

   EXT. THE NORTH MOUNTAIN -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf move through hostile terrain.
   Wind-swept icicles face horizontal.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So how exactly are you planning to
                  stop this weather?

                  That's your plan? My ice business
                  is riding on you talking to your

                              ANNA
                  Yup.

   Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where
   he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He
   stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So you're not at all afraid of her?

   Olaf backs right into an icicle. It runs through his torso.

                  Oh, look at that. I've been

   Kristoff looks around, sighs. Digs in his rucksack.

                            KRISTOFF
                  ...It's too steep. I've only got
                  one rope, and you don't know how to
                  climb mountains.

                              ANNA (O.S.)
                  Says who?

   Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to
   climb the cliff's flat face.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (finding her ridiculous)

   Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I wouldn't put my foot there.

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  You're distracting me.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Or there. How do you know Elsa even
                  wants to see you?

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  I'm just blocking you out cause I
                  gotta concentrate here.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You know, most people who disappear
                  into the mountains want to be
                  alone.

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  Nobody wants to be alone. Except

   Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold.

                  ...Does the air seem a bit thin to

                             KRISTOFF
                  Hang on.

   He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from
   behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.

                  Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

   Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Thanks! That was like a crazy trust
                  exercise.

   She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off.
   Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.


   EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsa's elegant ice palace.

                             ANNA
                  Whoa.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (in awe)
                  Now that's ice. I might cry.
                                                              64

                            ANNA
                  Go ahead. I won't judge.

   Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His
   hooves slip out. He scrambles but can't get traction.
   Kristoff runs to his aide.

                            KRISTOFF
                  All right, take it easy. I gotcha.

   Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  You stay right here, buddy.

   Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his
   tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  ...Flawless.

   Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.

                            OLAF
                  ...Knock....
                      (she doesn't)
                  Just knock....
                      (she doesn't. To Kristoff)
                  Why isn't she knocking...? Do you
                  think she knows how to knock?

   Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors
   slide open.

                            ANNA
                  Ha. It opened. That's a first.

   Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought,
   stops him.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  You should probably wait out here.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What?

                            ANNA
                  Last time I introduced her to a
                  guy, she froze everything.

                            KRISTOFF
                  But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice
                  is my life.

                               OLAF
                  Bye, Sven.

   Olaf starts to head inside. Anna stops him.

                            ANNA
                  You too, Olaf.

                               OLAF
                  Me?

                            ANNA
                  Just give us a minute.

                               OLAF
                  Okay.

   As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  One...two...

   Kristoff joins in.

                            OLAF AND KRISTOFF
                  Three...four...


   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but
   also eerie.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa? It's me...Anna?!

   Anna slips. Steadies herself.

                               ELSA (O.S.)
                  Anna.

   Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna,
   looks to her longingly.

   Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa, you look different.... It's a
                  good different.... And this place
                  is amazing.
                                                            66

                            ELSA
                      (cautious, polite)
                  Thank you, I never knew what I was
                  capable of.

   Anna starts to climb the stairs.

                            ANNA
                  ...I'm so sorry about what
                  happened. If I'd known--

   Elsa backs up, away from Anna.

                            ELSA
                      (on guard)
                  No, it's okay. You don't have to
                  apologize.... But you should
                  probably go, please.

                            ANNA
                  But I just got here.

                            ELSA
                  ...You belong in Arendelle.

                               ANNA
                  So do you.

   Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more.

                            ELSA
                  No, I belong here. Alone. Where I
                  can be who I am without hurting
                  anybody.

                            ANNA
                  ...Actually, about that--

                            OLAF (O.S.)
                  58...59...60.

                            ELSA
                  Wait. What is that?

   Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves.

                            OLAF
                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

                            ELSA
                      (shocked)
                  Olaf?

   Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated.
                                                                   67
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            OLAF
                      (bashful)
                  You built me. You remember that?

                            ELSA
                      (astonished)
                  And you're alive?

                            OLAF
                  Um...I think so?

   Anna kneels down beside Olaf.

                            ANNA
                  He's just like the one we built as
                  kids.... We were so close. We can
                  be like that again.

   Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her.

                                                       FLASH CUT TO:

   FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Anna!

   Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her.

                                                       FLASH CUT TO:

   THE PRESENT: Elsa's face sinks in pain.

                            ELSA
                  No, we can't.

   Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Goodbye, Anna.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa, wait--

                            ELSA
                      (calling back)
                  I'm just trying to protect you.

   Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues.

                             ANNA
                  You don't have to protect me. I'm
                  not afraid. Please don't shut me
                  out again.

   Anna SINGS.

                      "First Time in Forever, Reprise"

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  PLEASE DON'T SLAM THE DOOR.
                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
                  DISTANCE ANYMORE.

                  `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
                  FOREVER,
                  I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.
                  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
                  WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND.
                  WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN
                  TOGETHER.
                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR.
                  `CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
                  FOREVER,
                  I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

   They arrive on the top floor, Elsa's main living space. Elsa
   turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined.

                            ELSA
                  Anna,
                  PLEASE GO BACK HOME.
                  YOUR LIFE AWAITS.
                  GO ENJOY THE SUN
                  AND OPEN UP THE GATES.

                            ANNA
                  Yeah, but--

                            ELSA
                  I know!
                  YOU MEAN WELL,
                  BUT LEAVE ME BE.
                  YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND
                  FREE.

   Elsa opens up the balcony doors.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  JUST STAY AWAY AND YOU'LL BE SAFE
                  FROM ME.

                            ANNA
                  ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT.

                            ELSA
                  WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT?

                            ANNA
                  I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?

                            ELSA
                  WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?

                            ANNA
                  ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP
                  SNOW.

                            ELSA
                  What?

   Elsa looks past Anna's shoulder out white-peaked mountains.

                            ANNA
                  You kind of set off an eternal
                  winter...everywhere.

                            ELSA
                  Everywhere?

                            ANNA
                  It's okay, you can just unfreeze
                  it.

                            ELSA
                  No, I can't. I don't know how.

                            ANNA
                  Sure you can. I know you can.

   Snow starts to swirl around the room.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,

                            ELSA
                      (panicking)
                  I'M SUCH A FOOL!
                  I CAN'T BE FREE!

                            ANNA
                  YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

                            ELSA
                  NO ESCAPE
                  FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!

   The snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it.

                            ANNA
                  WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER.
                                                               70

                            ELSA
                  I CAN'T CONTROL THE CURSE!

                            ANNA
                  WE'LL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE
                  MADE.

                            ELSA
                  ANNA, PLEASE, YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT
                  WORSE!

                            ANNA
                  DON'T PANIC.

                            ELSA
                  THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR!

                            ANNA
                  WE'LL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.

                            ELSA
                  YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!

                            ANNA
                  WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...

   But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening
   blizzard taking over the room.

                             ELSA
                  NO!

                            ANNA (O.S.)
                  WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,
                  AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...

   Anna's voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.

                             ELSA
                  I CAN'T!

   Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and
   then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.

   Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in
   pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.

   Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff
   rush into the room to Anna's side.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna. Are you okay?
                                                                   71

                            ANNA
                  I'm okay.... I'm fine.

   Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain.

                            ELSA
                      (scared)
                  Who's this? Wait, it doesn't
                  matter. You have to go.

                             ANNA
                  No, I know we can figure this out
                  together--

                            ELSA
                      (desperate)
                  How? What power do you have to stop
                  this winter? To stop me?

   Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows
   creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna, I think we should go.

                            ANNA
                      (close to tears)
                  No. I'm not leaving without you,
                  Elsa.

                            ELSA
                      (heartbroken but decisive)
                  Yes, you are.

   Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman.
   We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.

                                                        SLAM CUT TO:


   EXT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their
   necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.

                            ANNA
                  Stop. Put us down!

                            OLAF
                      (to Marshmallow)
                  You are a lot stronger than I think
                  you realize.

   Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps.
                                                                    72

                            MARSHMALLOW
                      (like a bouncer)
                  Go away!

   Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, who's got his tongue stuck
   to the ice railing.

                              OLAF (O.S.)
                  Heads up!

   Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.

                              ANNA
                  Olaf!

                            OLAF
                  Watch out for my butt!

   Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the
   snowbank.

   Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.

   Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.

                            ANNA
                  It is not nice to throw people!

   Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.

              KRISTOFF                                   ANNA
   All right feisty pants. Calm             Let me at him. I want to get
   down. Woaw. Just let the snow            him. I.... Okay. I'm Calm.
   man be.

   Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and
   throws it at Marshmallow.

   The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even
   the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He
   ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!

                            OLAF
                  ...I'll distract him. You guys go.

   Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite
   direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  No, no, not you guys.
                                                               73

   Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's
   head falls and lands face down in snow.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                      (muffled)
                  This just got a whole lot harder.

   Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They
   tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard
   right behind them.

   They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under
   the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.

                               KRISTOFF
                  This way!

   Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of
   the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (impressed)
                  Ho-ho-ho!

                               ANNA
                  I got him!

   Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost
   run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Whoa, stop!

                            ANNA
                  It's a hundred foot drop.

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's two hundred.

   Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.

                               ANNA
                  Ow.

   He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the
   snow with a pick axe.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  What's that for?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I'm digging a snow anchor.
                                                            74

                            ANNA
                      (not trusting)
                  Okay. What if we fall?

                            KRISTOFF
                  There's twenty feet of fresh powder
                  down there; it'll be like landing
                  on a pillow.... Hopefully.

   They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Okay, Anna. On three.

   Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.

                            ANNA
                  Okay. You tell me when...

                               KRISTOFF
                  One...

                            ANNA
                  ...I'm ready to go....

                               KRISTOFF
                  Two...

                            ANNA
                      (pumped up)
                  ...I was BORN ready! Yes!

                               KRISTOFF
                  Calm down.

   A huge tree flies through the air toward them.

                               ANNA (O.S.)
                  TREE!

   Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They
   hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches
   their fall.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Whoa! That happened.

   Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete
   mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs
   and puffs, struggling to run.

                            OLAF
                  Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.
                                                               75
FROZEN - J. Lee



   He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!
                  Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost
                  Marshmallow back there!

   Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                      (happily)
                  Hey. We were just talking about
                  you. All good things, all good
                  things.

   Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoff's snow anchor.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                  NO!

   Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not
   making much of a difference.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  This is not making much of a
                  difference!

   Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                  WHOA!

   Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.

                              ANNA
                  Olaf!

                            OLAF
                  Hang in there, guys!

   Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Anna's rope up.

                            ANNA
                  Wait, what?

   Kristoff's head hits the cliff.

                              KRISTOFF
                  Aargghh!

   Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.

                              ANNA
                  Kristoff!
                                                               76

   Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all
   over them.

                            MARSHMALLOW
                  Don't come back!

                            ANNA
                      (grossed out by his snow
                       breath)
                  Ugh. We won't.

   Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to
   just as they fall. They both SCREAM!

   SLAM!

   REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her
   shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Hey, you were right. Just like a
                  pillow.

   She looks up to see Olaf's upper half hanging onto Kristoff's
   boots, which are sticking out of the snow.

                            OLAF
                      (shaking the boots)
                  I can't feel my legs! I can't feel
                  my legs!

   Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up. He spits out snow.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Those are my legs.

   Olaf's bottom goes running by.

                            OLAF
                      (to Kristoff)
                  Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my
                  butt.

   Kristoff grabs Olaf's head and puts it on his body.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Oh, that feels better.

   Sven walks up and sniffs Olaf's nose.

                               OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Hey, Sven!

   Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off
   his nose -- and misses.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  He found us.
                      (to Sven, funny voice)
                  Who's my cute little reindeer?

                            KRISTOFF
                  Don't talk to him like that.

   Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.

                               KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Here.

   He lifts her out easily.

                            ANNA
                      (impressed)
                  Whoa!

                               KRISTOFF
                  You okay?

                               ANNA
                  Thank you.

   They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...Um.... How's your head?

   She touches the spot where he banged his head.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (in pain)
                  Ah! Ooh!

   He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I mean, It's fine. Ah...I'm good.
                  Ha. I've got a thick skull.

                            OLAF
                  I don't have a skull.... Or bones.

                               KRISTOFF
                  ...So....

   The awkwardness is killing him.

                              KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (shy)
                  Now what?

                             ANNA
                      (shy)
                  Now what?
                      (then...panicking)
                  Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do?
                  She threw me out. I can't go back
                  to Arendelle with the weather like
                  this. And then there's your ice
                  business--

                            KRISTOFF
                  Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice
                  business...
                      (noticing something)
                  Worry about your hair?!

   She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.

                            ANNA
                  What? I just fell off a cliff. You
                  should see your hair.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No, yours is turning white.

   She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.

                            ANNA
                  White? It's what?

                            KRISTOFF
                  It's because she struck you; isn't
                  it?

                            ANNA
                  Does it look bad?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (thinking)
                  ...No.

   Olaf's head pops up. He's holding his head up off his body to
   join the conversation.

                            OLAF
                  You hesitated.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No, I didn't. Anna, you need help.
                  Now, come on.
                                                                  79

   He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow.

                            OLAF
                  Okay! Where are we going?

                            KRISTOFF
                  To see my friends.

                            ANNA
                      (catching up)
                  The love experts?

                            OLAF
                  Love experts?!

                            KRISTOFF
                  Yes. And don't worry; they'll be
                  able to fix this.

                            ANNA
                  How do you know?

   He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls
   heal her as a child.

                            KRISTOFF
                  ...Because I've seen them do it
                  before.

   As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven.

                            OLAF
                  I like to consider myself a love
                  expert.

   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself.

                            ELSA

   She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. She's left a
   sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow
   up the wall, taking over the castle.

   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as
   he rides on Sven's back.

                            OLAF
                  Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

   Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Are you cold?

                            ANNA
                  ...A little.

   He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides
   against it. He looks around as if he doesn't know what to do,
   then gets a thought.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Wait. Come here.

   He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-
   lined pass.

   Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path.
   He holds her hands over one of them.

                            ANNA
                  Oooh.... That's nice.

   They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (taking a deep breath)
                  So, about my friends...well, I say
                  friends, they're more like
                  family.... Anyway, when I was a
                  kid, it was just me and
                  Sven...until they took me in.

                            ANNA
                      (moved)
                  They did?

                            KRISTOFF
                      (nervous ramble)
                  Yeah. I don't want to scare you,
                  they can be a little bit
                  inappropriate...and loud...very
                  loud...they're also stubborn at
                  times, and a little overbearing.
                  And heavy. Really, really heavy.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  But they're fine.. You'll get it.
                  They mean well.

   Anna touches Kristoff's arm, reassuringly.

                            ANNA
                  Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

   Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Okay then....

   Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave
   of the arms announces--

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Meet my family.

   REVEAL: he's surrounded by rocks.

                             KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (to the rocks)
                  Hey, guys!

   As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and
   greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.

                            ANNA
                      (to herself)
                  ...They're rocks.

                            OLAF
                      (realizing)
                  He's crazy.
                      (covertly, to Anna)
                  I'll distract them while you run.
                      (Loud and slow to a rock)
                  Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to
                  meet you!
                      (quietly to Anna)
                  Anna, because I love you, I insist
                  you run.
                      (to the rock)
                  I understand you're love experts!
                      (to Anna)
                  Why aren't you running?

   Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away.

                            ANNA
                  Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--

   Just then the rocks around her start rolling.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (panicking)
                  Kristoff!

   Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff
   and unfold as trolls.

                            BULDA
                  KRISTOFF'S HOME!

                            TROLLS (VARIOUS)
                  Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's
                  been too long! Kristoff's home!

   Olaf jumps around all excitedly.

                            OLAF
                      (excitedly)
                  Kristoff's home.

   He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Wait? Kristoff?

   Anna watches, shocked and confused.

   The trolls all want Kristoff's attention. One troll yanks him
   down with a boulder's strength.

                            TROLL ONE
                  Oh, lemme look at you!

   Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.

                            TROLL TWO
                  Oh, take off your clothes,
                  Kristoff; I wash them.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (holding up his pants)
                  Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes
                  on, thank you.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Great to see you all. Where's
                  grandpa?

                            MUSHROOM KID TROLL
                  He's napping. But look, I grew a
                  mushroom.

                            TROLL SCOUT KID
                  And I earned my fire crystal.

                            KIDNEY STONE TROLL
                  I passed a kidney stone.

                            PICK ME UP TROLL
                  Pick me up.

   The kid troll jumps up on Kristoff's arm. Kristoff sinks
   under the weight of him.

   Anna still stares, confused, then realizes...

                            ANNA
                  Trolls? They're trolls.

   Silence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink.

                            BULDA
                  ...He's brought a girl!

                            TROLLS (TOGETHER)
                  He's brought a girl!

   Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll
   Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.

                            ANNA
                  What's going on?

                            KRISTOFF
                  I've learned to just roll with it.

   Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look
   at Anna. She studies her like she's a piece of cattle.

                            BULDA
                  Let me see. Bright eyes. Working
                  nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes.
                  She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

                            ANNA
                  Wait. Oh. Um. No.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You've got the wrong idea. That's
                  not why I brought her here.

                            ANNA
                  Right. We're not. I'm not--

   Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.

   Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly
   beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals.

                            ALL TROLLS
                  EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

                  WE NEED EACH OTHER

   By this time Kristoff and Anna are being ushered into a pit
   by the sheer force of numbers.

                  TRUE
                  TRUE
                  LOVE

   During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each
   other differently. Hmmm. Maybe those trolls are right?
   Sparks! Chemistry!

                            TROLL PRIEST
                  Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be
                  your trollfully wedded--

                  Wait, what?!

                            TROLLS
                  LOVE!

   Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. She's
   shivering something fierce.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna?

   He pulls off her cape and hat.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  She's as cold as ice.

   Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd.
   Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the
   pit.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  There's strange magic here!

                            KRISTOFF
                  Grand Pabbie!

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  Bring her to me, Kristoff.

   Kristoff helps Anna over. Pabbie looks into her weak eyes.

                            GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  Anna, your life is in danger. There
                  is ice in your heart, put there by
                  your sister. If not removed, to
                  solid ice will you freeze, forever.

                            ANNA
                  What...? No.

                            KRISTOFF
                  So remove it, Grand Pabbie.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  I can't. If it was her head, that
                  would be easy. But only an act of
                  true love can thaw a frozen heart.

                            ANNA
                  An act of true love?

                            BULDA
                      (googley, to her hubby)
                  A true love's kiss, perhaps?

   A bunch of trolls give each other kisses.

   Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms. More of
   her hair turns white.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna, we've got to get you back to
                  Hans.

                            ANNA
                      (still weak)
                  ...Hans.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Help us out, Sven.

   Kristoff grabs Sven's antlers. Sven pulls them out.

   Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Come on, Olaf!

   Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Sven's tail, rides with them.

                            OLAF
                  I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who

   EXT.    ELSA'S PALACE - DAWN

   Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle.

                            HANS
                  We are here to find Princess Anna.
                  Be on guard, but no harm is to come
                  to the Queen. Do you understand?

   The Duke's thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow
   rises from the ground behind Hans. It's Marshmallow, Elsa's
   snow guard.

                               MARSHMALLOW
                  Go away!

   He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of
   the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow,
   who quickly knocks them over.

   Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple
   over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but
   Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword,
   leaps, and grabs it.

   Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.

   The Duke's two thugs see her.

                               DUKE'S THUG
                  The Queen.

   The thugs charge up the stairs.

   INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY

   They guards burst through the ice doors.

   Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue.

   They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.

                            ELSA
                      (scared)
                  No. Please.

   One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last
   moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches
   from her face.

   The thugs reposition to take another shot.

                               ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Stay away!

   Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and
   continue the attack.

                            THUG
                  Get her! Get her!

   Elsa fights for her life.

   BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls
   away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices
   Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles
   back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not
   before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge.

   REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and
   they rush into the ice palace.


   INT. ICE PALACE -- DAY

   Elsa is surrounded. It's do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa
   traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.

   The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against
   the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK.

   OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug
   is pushed to the edge. He's inches away from falling to his
   death.

   BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and
   the thugs near death.
                                                                   90

                            HANS
                  Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster
                  they fear you are.

   Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened,
   moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans,
   overwhelmed, frightened.

   The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice
   spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage
   and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back.

   Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the
   arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging
   directly above Elsa.

   The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN.

   Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast.

   All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the
   sound of it shattering as it rings out.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.


   FADE IN ON:

   Elsa's face as her eyes flutter open.

   She sits up. She's surrounded by stone.


   INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON -- DAY

   Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. She's
   pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves.
   She's chained to the wall.

   Elsa strains to looks out a window...

   INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting
   further buried under the ice and snow that is falling.

                            ELSA
                  No....What have I done?

   Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Why did you bring me here?

                            HANS
                  I couldn't just let them kill you.
                                                              91

                  Anna.

                            HANS
                  Anna has not returned....

   Elsa looks to the storm with worry.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  If you would just stop the winter,
                  bring back summer...please.

   Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.

                            ELSA
                  Don't you see...I can't.

   Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  You have to tell them to let me go.

   Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.

                            HANS
                  I will do what I can.

   He opens the door and leaves.

   Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her
   shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up.

                                                        CUT TO:


   EXT. THE FJORDS -- DAY

   Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his
   back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style.

   Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms. She's weakening. Kristoff
   takes off his hat and puts it on her head.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Just hang in there.
                      (to Sven)
                  Come on, buddy, faster!

   They arrive at the walls of Arendelle. Olaf slides past them,
   out of control.

   He disappears into the village streets.

                            OLAF (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Hello!

                  It's Princess Anna!

   Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off,
   holding Anna, and carries her to the gate.

                            KRISTOFF
                  I've got you.

   Anna looks up at him, gratefully.

                            ANNA
                  ...Are you g-gonna be okay?

                      (touched, reassuring)
                  Don't worry about me.

   Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid
   rush to help Anna.

                            GERDA
                  Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.

                            KAI
                  My Lady. You are freezing.

                            GERDA
                  You poor girl, you're freezing.

                            KAI
                  We will. Thank you.

   Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Make sure she's safe!

   Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him.

   Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with
   worry at the closed gates.

   Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly
   follows.

   Hans stands with the dignitaries and guards.

                  You cannot risk going out there

                  Princess, you are all Arendelle has
                  left.

   Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to
   depend on him. Is he really all they have left?

   Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna.

                            KAI
                  He's in here. Prince Hans.

   Hans rushes to Anna. She falls into his arms.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  You're so cold.

                            ANNA
                      (weak, but desperate)
                  Hans, you have to kiss me.

                            HANS
                  What?

                            ANNA
                  Now. Here we go.

   She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in
   his arms.

                            GERDA
                  We'll give you two some privacy.

   Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.

                            HANS
                  What happened out there?

                            ANNA
                  Elsa struck me with her powers.

                            HANS
                  You said she'd never hurt you.

                            ANNA
                  I was wrong.

   Anna crumbles, weak.

                            HANS
                  Anna.

   Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.

                            ANNA
                      (shivering more)
                  She froze my heart and only an act
                  of true love can save me.

                            HANS
                      (understanding)
                  A true love's kiss.

   He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile.
   He leans in slowly...gently...

   Then he stops.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  Oh, Anna. If only there was someone
                  out there who loved you.

                            ANNA
                  What?

   Hans gets up, leaving her there.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  ...You said you did.

   He goes to the window and shuts the curtains.

                            HANS
                  As thirteenth in line in my own
                  kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I
                  knew I'd have to marry into the
                  throne somewhere--

                            ANNA
                  What are you talking about?

                            HANS
                      (putting out the candles)
                  As heir, Elsa was preferable, of
                  course. But no one was getting
                  anywhere with her. But you-

                            ANNA
                  Hans?

                            HANS
                  You were so desperate for love you
                  were willing to marry me, just like
                  that.

   Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table
   and goes to the fireplace.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  I figured, after we married, I'd
                  have to stage a little accident for
                  Elsa.

   Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire.
   Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak.

                            ANNA
                  Hans. No, stop.

                            HANS
                  But then she doomed herself, and
                  you were dumb enough to go after
                  her.

                            ANNA
                  Please.

                            HANS
                      (chuckles)
                  All that's left now is to kill Elsa
                  and bring back summer.

   Hans approaches Anna.

                            ANNA
                  ...You're no match for Elsa.

   He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time
   not so gently.

                            HANS
                  No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on
                  the other hand, am the hero who is
                  going to save Arendelle from
                  destruction.

   She wrenches her face out of his hands.

                            ANNA
                      (anger)
                  You won't get away with this.

   Hans rises and crosses to the door.

                            HANS
                  Oh, I already have.

   Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna
   struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.

                            ANNA
                      (hoarse and weak)
                  Please, somebody help.

   The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the
   floor.

   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- NIGHT

   The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He
   rubs his arms and shivers.

                            DUKE
                  It's getting colder by the minute.
                  If we don't do something soon,
                  we'll all freeze to death.

   Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  Prince Hans.

                            HANS
                  Princess Anna is...dead.

                            VARIOUS DIGNITARIES
                  What...? No.... Mon dieu.

   Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair.

                            DUKE
                  What happened to her?

                            HANS
                  She was killed by Queen Elsa.

                            DUKE
                  Her own sister.

                            HANS
                      (really putting it on)
                  At least we got to say our marriage
                  vows...before she died in my arms.

   He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.

                            DUKE
                  There can be no doubt now; Queen
                  Elsa is a monster and we are all in
                  grave danger.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to
                  you.

   Hans nods; he knows what he's being asked to do, and he'll do
   it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.
                                                               98

                            HANS
                  With a heavy heart, I charge Queen
                  Elsa of Arendelle with treason and
                  sentence her to death.


   INT. ELSA'S DUNGEON -- DAY

   The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is
   devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.

                            GUARD (O.S.)
                  She's dangerous. Move quickly and
                  with resolve.

   Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door
   busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men
   duck out of the way.

   Hans pushes his way into the room...sees...

   The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the
   floor. Elsa is gone.


                                                       CUT TO:


   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE -- DAY

   Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not
   wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes
   his head. Enough.

   He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts
   and grunts.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What is it, buddy?

   Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Hey, watch it. What's wrong with
                  you?

   Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                      (avoiding)
                  ...I don't understand you when you
                  talk like that.
                                                              99
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to
   lift Kristoff off the ground.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

   Sven drops him hard then "yells" at him once more.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  No, Sven! We're not going back!

   Sven shakes his head, angrily.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  She's with her true love.

   Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it;
   he's made his point.

   Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the
   kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the
   castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Anna.

   Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven
   runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and
   jumps onto his back.

                                                        CUT TO:


   INT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT

   Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking
   the ceiling.

   The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again.

                            ANNA
                      (barely a whisper)
                  Help.

   CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and
   hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back
   on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.

                            OLAF
                  Anna. Oh no.

   He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood,
   including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues,
   before striking a match and relighting the fire.

                            ANNA
                  Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

                             OLAF
                  Whoa! So this is heat....
                      (considering)
                  I love it.

   He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on
   fire.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Ooh! But don't touch it!

   He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to
   the fire.

                             OLAF (CONT'D)
                  So, where's Hans? What happened to
                  your kiss?

                             ANNA
                  I was wrong about him. It wasn't
                  true love.

                            OLAF
                      (confused innocence)
                  Huh. But we ran all the way here?

                            ANNA
                  Please Olaf, you can't stay here;
                  you'll melt.

                            OLAF
                  I am not leaving here until we find
                  some other act of true love to save
                  you.

   He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against
   hers and thinks.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  ...Do you happen to have any ideas?

                            ANNA
                  I don't even know what love is.

                            OLAF
                      (confident)
                  That's okay, I do....

   Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder.

FROZEN - J. Lee



                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Love is...putting someone else's
                  needs before yours, like, you know,
                  how Kristoff brought you back here
                  to Hans and left you forever.

                            ANNA
                  ...Kristoff loves me?

                            OLAF
                  Wow, you really don't know anything
                  about love, do you?

   His face starts to melt.

                            ANNA
                  Olaf, you're melting.

                            OLAF
                      (sweet and reassuring)
                  Some people are worth melting for.

   But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow
   back in place.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Just maybe not right this second.

   Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Don't worry, I've got it!

   Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut
   but struggles with the second panel.

                             OLAF (CONT'D)
                      (determined)
                  We're going to get through--
                      (distracted)
                  Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting
                  something.

   He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope
   and sees...

   Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  It's Kristoff and Sven! They're
                  coming back this way.

                            ANNA
                  ...They-they are?

                            OLAF
                  Wow, he's really moving fast.
                  Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I
                  guess Kristoff doesn't love you
                  enough to leave you behind.

   Anna tries to get to her feet.

                            ANNA
                  Help me up, Olaf. Please.

   He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the
   chess set and water jugs.

                            OLAF
                  No, no, no, no, no. You need to
                  stay by the fire and keep warm.

                            ANNA
                  I need to get to Kristoff.

                            OLAF
                      (clueless)
                  Why...?
                      (realizing)
                  Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

   He hops around in an excited display of hope.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  There's your act of true love,
                  right there, riding across the
                  fjords like a valiant, pungent
                  reindeer king! Come on!

   The walls crack under the ice pressure.

                              OLAF (CONT'D)
                  Look out!

   They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.


   INT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- DAY

   Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and
   block their path.

                            OLAF
                  We're trapped.

   Anna looks around desperately for a way out.

   EXT. FJORD -- DAY

   Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind.


   EXT. CASTLE -- DAY

   Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it
   sweeps the window panes away.

                            OLAF
                  Slide, Anna.

   It's a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have?
   They slide down the iced-covered building.

   Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers
   snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant
   snowball.

                            OLAF (CONT'D)
                  We made it!

   He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.


   EXT. FJORD -- DAY

   Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across
   the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the
   storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight
   through.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Come on, buddy, faster.



                                                     CUT TO:

   Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.

                              ANNA
                  Kristoff!

   The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling
   off into the storm.

                            OLAF
                  Keep going, Anna!

   Anna struggles on.
                                                              104

                              ANNA
                  Kristoff!

                                                       PAN TO:

   Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven
   struggles over the uneven surface.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Come on! Come on!

   Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.
   They give it all they've got as debris falls all   around them
   and the mast shatters. They make it past just as   the entire
   ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath   their feet.

   The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it's too
   wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing
   water and disappears below.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Sven? Sven!

   At first there's nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy
   water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a
   floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to
   go on.

                              KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Good boy.

                                                       CUT TO:

   Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna's hands frost over
   an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she's running
   out of time.

   She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the
   inevitable is coming.

                                                       CUT TO:

   Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn't know which way to
   turn. But then he hears a faint--

                              ANNA (O.S.)
                  Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Anna...? Anna!

   Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is
   consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It's Hans.

                            HANS
                  Elsa. You can't run from this!

   Elsa backs away from him.

                            ELSA
                  ...Just take care of my sister.

                            HANS
                  Your sister? She returned from the
                  mountain weak and cold. She said
                  you froze her heart.

                              ELSA
                  What? No.

                            HANS
                  I tried to save her, but it was too
                  late. Her skin was ice. Her hair
                  turned white...

   Elsa's face sinks as she realizes what she has done.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                  Your sister is dead... because of
                  you.

   Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that,
   the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air,
   hangs suspended, trapped in grief.

   Citizens and dignitaries rush to the wall's edge and look out
   to see...

   Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the
   fjords to...

                            ANNA
                      (a whisper)
                  Kristoff.

                              KRISTOFF
                  Anna.

   Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards
   her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is
   giving it all he's got. He's going to make it.

   But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from
   its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he
   raises his sword over his head.
                                                           106
FROZEN - J. Lee



                              ANNA
                  Elsa.

   Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him
   a longing look, but then turns away from him and then...

   Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword
   down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  No!

   In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits
   her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force
   of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out.

                              ELSA
                  Anna!

   Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.

   Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.

                            OLAF
                      (confused, sad)
                  Anna?

   Elsa hugs Anna and cries.

   Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his
   side.

   Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads.

   All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence.

   But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw.

   Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up.

   Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa.

                            ELSA
                  Wha-? Anna?

   Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved.

                              ANNA
                  Oh, Elsa.

   They embrace.
                                                              107
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            ELSA
                  ...You sacrificed yourself for me?

                             ANNA
                      (weak)
                  ...I love you.

   Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he
   lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--

                            OLAF
                  An act of true love will thaw a
                  frozen heart.

                            ELSA
                      (processing)
                  Love...will thaw...
                      (realizing)
                  Love.... Of course.

   Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa?

                            ELSA
                  Love.

   Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The
   ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air.

   Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws.

   The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.

   The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.

   In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant
   snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm
   summer day.

                            ANNA
                  I knew you could do it.

                            OLAF
                      (melting, good-naturedly)
                  Hands down, this is the best day of
                  my life...and quite possibly the
                  last.

                            ELSA
                  Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.
                                                                  108
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold
   air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little,
   perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.

                            OLAF
                  Hey, my own personal flurry.

   Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches
   toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and
   stops him.

                            ANNA
                  Uh. Uh. Uh.

   She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.

                            HANS
                      (confused)
                  Anna? But she froze your heart.

                            ANNA
                  The only frozen heart around here
                  is yours.

   She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet
   satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.

                            HANS
                  Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

   He falls overboard.

   Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder,
   Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


   EXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY

   It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been
   repaired and are sailing away.

   On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.

                            FRENCH DIGNITARY
                      (to Kai)
                  I will return this scoundrel to his
                  country. We shall see what his
                  twelve big brothers think of his
                  behavior.

                            KAI
                  Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.
                                                           109
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two
   thugs to their ship.

                            DUKE
                  This is unacceptable. I am
                  innocent. I'm a victim of fear.
                  I've been traumatized.
                      (bad acting)
                  Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a
                  doctor I could...No? And I demand
                  to see the Queen!

   Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

                            KAI
                  I have a message from the Queen.
                      (reading a scroll)
                  Arendelle will henceforth and
                  forever no longer do business of
                  any sort with Weaseltown.

                            DUKE
                  Weselton. It's Weselton!

   The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.


   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE -- DAY

   Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff
   along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.

                            ANNA
                  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

   She runs him right into a pole.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Pole.

                            ANNA
                  Oops. Sorry.


   EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS -- DAY

   Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops.

                            ANNA
                      (stopping)
                  Okay. Okay. Here we are.
                                                           110
FROZEN - J. Lee



   She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before
   him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in
   front of it -- Vanna White-style.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I owe you a sled.

                            KRISTOFF
                      (blown away)
                  Are you serious?

                            ANNA
                  Yes. And it's the latest model.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No. I can't accept this...

                            ANNA
                  You have to. No returns. No
                  exchanges. Queen's orders. She's
                  named you the official Arendelle
                  Ice Master and Deliverer.

   Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's
   king of the bucks.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What? That's not a thing.

   But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.

                            ANNA
                  Sure it is. And it even has a cup
                  holder.... Do you like it?

                             KRISTOFF
                  Like it?

   He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I love it.... I could kiss you!

   He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  ...I could. I mean I'd like to.
                  I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may
                  we? Wait, what?

   She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.

                             ANNA
                  We may.
                                                              111
FROZEN - J. Lee



   He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.

   We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.

   With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the
   flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.

   Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks
   the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.

   Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the
   carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it
   belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf
   doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.

                                                       CUT TO:


   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY

   The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,
   stands Elsa.

                            ELSA
                  Are you ready?

   Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The
   people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.

   Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds
   some snow flurries for atmosphere.

   Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.

                            ANNA
                  I like the open gates.

                            ELSA
                  We are never closing them again.

   Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally
   made of ice) form on Anna's boots.

                            ANNA
                  What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
                  but you know I don't ska--

   Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna
   slips and slides, but laughs in delight.

   Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Look out. Reindeer coming through!
                                                                 112
FROZEN - J. Lee



   Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna.

                            OLAF
                  That's it. Glide and pivot and
                  glide and pivot.

   We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye
   view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been
   repaired with a ice.

   All is right in Arendelle.

                                                   FINAL FADE OUT.

                                  THE END

          INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT

          GEORGE SIMMONS, 42, sits in a giant living room watching bad
          television on a 70-inch flat screen TV. He looks bored and
          empty. After a few beats he pauses the TV, and picks up the
          phone.

          GEORGE
          (on the phone)
          Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm
          coming in.

          INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Shots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club.
          The place adores him. We see quick images of him after the
          show interacting with people. He is clearly a very famous
          comedian.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          George has sex with a girl in her early twenties.

          INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT

          George sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone,
          he is bored and alone again. He hits play on his TV and
          begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before.

          INT. BEL AIR HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

          GEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all
          alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate
          his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him
          at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little
          cold. On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is
          supposed to read.

          EXT. GEORGE'S HOME - MORNING

          George hits balls in his home batting cage. Then we see him
          driving golf balls inside there. In the background we see
          his modern, space ship looking house. It is enormous.

          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

          George drives his large black Mercedes.

          EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - DAY

          George gets out of his car and walks towards the tower. Two
          COLLEGE STUDENTS walk over.

          COLLEGE STUDENT
          Hey George, can I get a picture
          with you?

          GEORGE
          Sure buddy. Let's do it.
          One of the college students put his arm around George while
          the other takes the picture.

          COLLEGE STUDENT #2
          Can I get one?

          GEORGE
          Yeah bud.
          They take the picture.

          COLLEGE STUDENT
          You're the man. We love all your
          movies, even the last one.

          GEORGE
          Thanks. Tell your friends.

          George sits in the doctor's office staring at the photos of
          the doctor with his beautiful young children. DOCTOR STEVENS
          enters and sits down. He takes a deep breath.

          GEORGE
          I like those lunestas. They really
          put me to sleep without giving me
          the sleeping pill hangover I get
          from the restorils.

          (BEAT)
          I try not to take them too often.
          Just when I know I have to get up
          early.

          DOCTOR STEVENS
          George there are some
          irregularities in your blood
          work...
          George's face turns white. He knows what this means. The
          doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out--
          it is now all a jumble of words.

          ANGLE ON GEORGE'S POV
          We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation
          certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor's office art,
          a picture of him skiing with his family. He keeps talking,
          but now we hear nothing.

          EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

          George walks down the stairs towards the parking lot in a
          daze. An ASIAN GIRL and her MOTHER and BROTHER see him and
          start screaming.

          GIRL
          Oh my God. Can you take a picture
          with me?

          GEORGE
          Yeah, sure.
          She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in
          too.

          GIRL
          Thanks. You are the funniest.

          GEORGE
          Thanks, pal.

          !NT. CAR - DAY
          George drives home. We hear the voice of his doctor in his
          head.

          

          

          

          

          4.

          DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
          It's a rare blood disorder. In the
          family of Hodgkins disease. We
          really don't have a treatment for
          it. There are things we can try.
          They're all very experimental in
          nature.

          GEORGE (V.0.)
          I don't understand what this means.

          DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)
          I think you need to hope for the
          best and prepare for the worst. Is
          there someone who can help you get
          your affairs in order?

          INT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET - DAY

          IRA, a 25-year-old, works at the deli counter, along with
          CHUCK, a large, sweet-looking 45-year-old deli counter lifer,
          and GAIL, a very skinny, very old, straight-talking,
          humorless woman in her fifties.
          Ira is in the middle of a very long conversation with a
          middle-aged WOMAN.

          WOMAN
          Is the turkey organic?

          IRA
          Yes, ma'am.

          WOMAN
          Well what does organic mean?

          IRA
          It means there's no additives or
          preservatives and it's hormone
          free.

          WOMAN
          Are there additives or
          preservatives in the food they feed
          the turkey?

          IRA
          I don't know ma'am.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          WOMAN
          I heard that because turkeys are
          fatty birds, mercury gets stuck in
          their fat. My daughter-in-law, she
          ate turkey and then she had a
          miscarriage.

          IRA
          I haven't heard about that. But I
          may not be informed enough to
          comment.

          WOMAN
          Well, you're not a doctor, so you
          shouldn't comment.

          IRA
          You are correct, I am not a doctor.

          INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

          Ira and Chuck are preparing trays of food.

          IRA
          You should come see me do stand-up
          tonight at the Comedy and Magic
          Club.

          CHUCK
          I can't go through that again, man,
          that was painful.

          IRA
          That was five months ago. I've
          gotten a lot better.

          CHUCK
          They pay you yet?

          IRA
          Nah, not there. I just hang out and
          hope somebody doesn't show.

          CHUCK
          Wow, is there anyway for you to.be
          lower in show business? I don't
          know if you could even say you're
          in show business. Why don't you
          just fucking settle down and enjoy
          this gig? This is a sweet
          situation. The money's good,
          you've got health insurance.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          IRA
          Dude, I know you like it here but
          if I have to work here another year
          I would kill myself.

          CHUCK
          Really? In that case, when we bury
          you does it have to be in some kind
          of Jew cemetery? Next to Al Jolson
          or some shit?

          IRA
          Just come. I need the support.

          CHUCK
          No way. I'm funnier than you. And
          I'm not even that funny. I would go
          if I was paying to see me.

          IRA
          I'll pay your cover charge.

          CHUCK
          Okay, well you better be good,
          because I'm bringing a date.

          IRA
          Laughter's the ultimate lubricant.

          INT. BEL AIR HOME - DUSK

          An Otis Redding song is playing as George walks around his
          house in a daze, not sure how to process this. He doesn't
          call anybody. There's nobody in sight. We see images of him
          thinking about the unthinkable and the life he's lead.
          He sits in his office, surrounded by photos of himself at
          difference ages. It builds to a sequence of him going
          through stacks of old photos and watching videos of himself,
          reviewing his life, trying to make sense of what it all
          meant. We see clips of his good movies and his last bad
          movie. On the wall is a poster of a buddy film which shows
          him and another famous comedian.
          ON-SCREEN -- home video of George at college. George is
          hanging out with his friends. They are acting goofy, having
          the time of their lives. George looks very young, skinny,
          and carefree. Life has never been better. They play a
          ridiculous drinking game and laugh uproariously.

          ANOTHER IMAGE - We see a very young George performing stand-
          up on Late Night with David Letterman. He's so young and
          naive, he seems like a completely different person.

          make of this journey of his.

          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Ira sits with one of his roommates, LEO, who is also an
          aspiring comedian. They sit across from each other, kicking
          around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones. We
          see an entire pitch session play out.
          Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't
          figured out what his stage persona is yet.

          IRA
          I was thinking about doing
          something about how I'm not good
          looking and I'm not bad looking.
          I'm just good looking enough that
          if I had a good personality, it
          could put me over the top. If that
          was the case.

          LEO
          Yeah, something about how the
          uglier you are, the better the
          personality you need. And the
          hotter you are, the stupider you
          can be.

          IRA
          I had a joke once about how you
          never see incredibly hot, blonde,
          homeless women. Because someone
          will always take care of that kind
          of woman. That woman could be the
          dumbest person on earth and she
          will survive in this world.

          LEO
          Maybe something like... you can be
          hot and stupid and survive in the
          world. And you can be smart and
          ugly and survive in the world. The
          people who have trouble are the
          stupid, ugly people.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          IRA
          That could work.

          LEO
          Let me keep that one, because I
          thought of most of it.

          IRA
          That's not cool. I came up with
          the concept! What do you got?
          Let's work on what you have.

          LEO
          I've got nothing in the notebook.
          I got drunk last night. But I need
          material, because I just got spots
          at the Improv. Budd saw me and
          approved me. I'm in.

          IRA
          How could they make you a regular?
          I got turned down twice.

          LEO
          Sorry, man. They're only going to
          let in one chubby, caustic Jew, so
          I think you're fucked.
          Their other roommate, MARK, walks in, waves a check at them.

          MARK
          Hey, dudes. You see this check
          that I got from my TV show for
          25,000 an episode? There was
          another one of these on the kitchen
          counter. Did you see it?

          IRA
          No we didn't see it. Just don't
          leave those things laying around.

          MARK
          I wouldn't leave it around if they
          didn't give me so many. They give
          it to me every episode.

          LEO
          Don't throw it in our face that
          you're on a shitty show.

          

          

          

          

          9.

          MARK
          I wouldn't, if it was a shitty show
          and not what Time magazine called
          "insightful and delightful."

          IRA
          I thought you were moving out.

          MARK
          I decided I like it here. Living
          with you guys keeps me grounded. I
          don't want to be the guy living in
          the house on the hill. Even though
          I could afford it. Hey, I saw that
          girl comic you like who lives
          upstairs. I invited her in. She's
          here.

          IRA
          She's in our apartment? I've never
          even talked to her. I just gave
          her quarters at the washing
          machine.

          MARK
          You were right, she is pretty mousy
          and sexy. You gotta talk to her.

          IRA
          I need time. I have a three-month
          plan.

          MARK
          I'll give you ten days for your
          three-month plan, then I am going
          to fuck her. You can't just leave
          that laying around. Starting right
          now.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Mark is talking to DAISY, an alternative-feeling, dark-haired
          girl in her early twenties. His television show is on the

          TV.

          MARK
          The thing about working on a sitcom
          is it's 22 weeks a year, so I can
           do stand-up the rest of the year.

          MARK (CONT'D)
          But now people want to see me
          because they see me on a TV show,
          so I am kind of a draw. Have you
          seen the show?

          DAISY
          I don't own a TV.

          MARK
          Well I think you can download it to
          an iPod.
          Ira walks in.

          MARK (CONT'D)
          Hey Ira, this is Daisy.

          DAISY
          how's it going?

          IRA
          Nice to meet you. I think I gave
          you quarters once.
          Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup.
          He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup
          falls over and spills all over the counter. Mark looks
          horrified.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          (nervously joking)
          Don't worry, I'll just lick it off
          the counter.
          Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag.

          INT. COMEDY AND MAGIC CLUB - NIGHT

          Leo is on stage, performing his act, doing well.
          ANGLE ON Ira watching, both amused and jealous. A MAGICIAN
          and the EMCEE walks over to him.

          EMCEE
          Schneider didn't show up so, you
          can do ten minutes after Leo.

          MAGICIAN
          Don't go long because I have to
          load pigeons into my suit. I have
          to let them out or they'll die.
          I'm not fucking around.

          MAGICIAN (CONT'D)
          So when you get the light, don't go
          long. You've got one minute.
          ANGLE ON Leo on stage, doing a few more jokes. A MANAGER
          walks over to Ira.

          MANAGER
          Hey man. George Simmons just got
          here, he wants to go up. You're
          bumped. We'll put you on after
          George.

          IRA
          Well how long is he going to do?

          MANAGER
          I don't know. Last night he did
          five minutes. Last week he did an
          hour. fie'il do what he wants to do.

          IRA
          Well what about the magician? He
          just loaded his pigeons. He said I
          have to get off in ten minutes.

          MANAGER
          I'll have him unload the pigeons.
          Just be ready.
          Leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage.

          LEO
          That was good, right? Some of the
          new stuff worked.

          IRA
          I just got bumped by George
          Simmons.

          LEO
          Are you serious? Shit - I've got a
          spot at the Improv, I cant hang
          out, damn.

          ANGLE ON THE STAGE

          EMCEE
          A lot of times you hear about going
          to a comedy club and someone
          exciting shows up. I won't lie to
          you, that usually never happens.
          But tonight it is happening.

          Ladies and gentleman, you know him
          from [movie credits to go here]
          George Simmons?
          George walks on stage. The place goes crazy. He does some
          of his normal routine and the audience laughs and is very
          appreciative.
          As George continues his act, it starts getting darker and
          darker until he is talking about death and the lack of
          meaning in it all.

          GEORGE
          Ah life. What does it mean?
          sometimes life makes perfect sense.
          And then you `come'.

          ON IRA

          IRA
          He's killing the crowd. Jesus, I
          can't follow this shit.
          After completely losing the crowd, and some minor
          confrontations with audience members, he exits the stage.

          GEORGE
          Life isn't all about laughs. Crazy
          shit happens. You've got to be
          nice to each other. You never know
          what's going to happen.
          Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Sorry I sucked it up out there. At
          least they are well rested for you.
          Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to do his act, but he
          is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the
          weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage. He
          basically bombs. We reveal Chuck and his date watching,
          looking miserable.

          IRA
          I'm not good looking. I'm not bad
          looking. I'm just in the middle.
          And if I had a personality that was
          Jut good enough, it would put me
          over the edge.
          The joke fails. We reveal George also watching him bomb,
          amused by his struggle. He sees something he likes in Ira.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          EXT. PARKING LOT

          Ira walks to his car. In the spot next to him is an enormous
          Suburban SUV parked in a spot meant for compact cars. It is
          so close to Ira's car that it isn't possible to open the
          door. He hears some banging and odd wails from in the car.
          Ira knocks on the window. We see that George is sitting in
          his car in a world of pain. He's clearly been crying. The
          knock startles him. He turns to Ira.

          IRA
          Sorry, man. I didn't mean to
          disturb you. I just can't open my
          door. There's no room.

          GEORGE
          Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out.
          George pulls the car back ten feet.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          (calling to Ira)
          Hey man, you had some funny shit
          tonight.

          IRA
          Thanks!

          GEORGE
          Man, that audience hated you. They
          really did not like you. They liked
          your buddy, who looked exactly like
          you but was funnier. Man, that's
          going to haunt you. You're going
          to wake up in six months and think
          about this night.

          IRA
          Well, I'll probably bomb worse
          tomorrow and forget about this one.

          GEORGE
          I'm just fucking with you. You had
          some funny jokes in there. Good
          writing.

          IRA
          Well, obviously, I'm a... you
          know...I grew up on your shit, man.
          George just stares at him.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          GEORGE
          Alright, pal. Don't worry. Only
          two hundred people saw that
          tonight. I'll see you later.
          George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by
          Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and
          starts screaming...

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          You're gonna die!!! I'm gonna kill
          you!
          Then he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is
          the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.

          INT. IRA'S APARTMENT - NEXT DAY

           FULL SCREEN COMPUTER: We see a comedy short made by Leo.
          It's very funny.

          IRA
          Holy shit, you got seven hundred
          thousand hits in four days.

          LEO
          They put it on the main page at
          YouTube and it exploded. Which
          would be awesome if someone would
          pay me.
          The phone rings.

          IRA
          Hello?

          GEORGE (V.0.)
          Hey, is this Ira?

          IRA
          Yeah. Who is this?

          GEORGE
          It's George.

          IRA
          Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going?

          

          

          

          

          15.

          GEORGE
          I thought you and Leo were pretty
          funny last night and I have to do
          this corporate gig for Apple
          computers in a couple of days and I
          thought you guys could write me
          some jokes.

          IRA
          Definitely. What kind of jokes?
          Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to
          include him in this job offer.

          GEORGE
          I don't know, about computers and
          shit. I could mainly do my act but
          they like it if you talk about them
          a little.

          IRA
          No problem. Where do you want me
          to send em?

          GEORGE
          What is your email? I will send
          you my fax and email and all that.

          IRA
          It's a...irasexiraÃÂ®gmail.com.

          GEORGE
          (long silence)
          I almost just changed my mind. You
          got to change that.

          IRA
          Ok.

          GEORGE
          Today. Seriously. Ok. Later.
          Ira hangs up and turns to his friends.

          IRA
          That was George Simmons. He wants
          me to write jokes for him.

          LEO
          Holy shit. That is awesome. You
          are so lucky.

          

          

          

          

          16.

          MARK
          Are you gonna get to meet him?

          IRA
          I don't know, but he is gonna send
          me his email address.

          LEO
          We are gonna have his email
          address? I have to send him the
          link to my short.

          IRA
          Easy. Let me get in there a little
          more.

          CUT TO:

          INT. IRA'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Ira is writing jokes. The camera follows the letters being
          typed on the computer screen as he types.
          "Always erase your web history. I had a girlfriend hit
          history and see eleven hundred porn sites that I visited in
          an hour."
          Jonah sticks his head in.

          LEO
          I got one, but you have to tell him
          its mine. The best thing about
          Leopard is it lets you watch a
          porno, write a porno, shoot a
          porno, and order a porno all at the
          same time. And you guys made that
          possible.
          We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing. He is
          writing an enormous amount of jokes. Way more than George
          will ever need. Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re-
          typing, etc.
          Ira hesitates, then hits send.

          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM

          Ira is asleep. The clock says noon.
          The phone rings. He answers it, groggy.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          GEORGE
          There's some funny shit in here.
          Not a bad ratio of good jokes to
          shit.

          IRA
          Thanks man. I just want to give
          you a lot of choices.

          GEORGE
          Too many choices. I don't like
          reading that much. I need like ten
          good jokes. I'm a little mad you
          made me read that many to get to
          ten. But thanks for doing it.

          IRA
          Oh, it was fun to try to write in
          your voice. I spent the whole
          night pretending I was you.

          GEORGE
          So you cried yourself to sleep?

          (ALT)
          So you whacked off three times last
          night? Don't worry, I'll get you
          some money. Is five hundred good?

          IRA
          Yeah! That'll work.

          GEORGE
          I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go
          to the gig. You want to come check
          it out, see if your shit works?

          INT. IRA'S APARTMENT

          CLOSE-UP on their curtains, as they wait for George to pull
          up.

          LEO
          Can we go outside and meet him?

          IRA
          No you can't. Because then we look
          like fans.

          MARK
          Maybe he's seen my show.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          IRA
          He doesn't watch your show. You're
          show is for eight-year-olds. It's
          a family show, he doesn't watch
          that shit.

          LEO
          I'll just go outside and pretend
          I'-,n washing my car.
          The Limo pulls up outside.

          LEO (CONT'D)
          Holy shit. I feel like my little
          girl is going to the prom.

          INT./EXT. LIMO - MOMENTS LATER

          The door opens, Ira gets in.

          GEORGE
          How you doing, you ready for this?

          IRA
          Yeah, this'll be fun.

          GEORGE
          I think I'm going to have you go on
          before me to warn them up.

          IRA
          You don't have to do that. What if
          I bomb?

          GEORGE
          Hey, if you bomb, they'll just be
          more excited to see me. They'll be
          so glad your not on stage any more.
          Then if you do well, they'll be
          ready for me. Either way, you're
          helpful.

          I/E PRIVATE JET - LATER
          The limo pulls up to a private jet. Ira is shocked.
          A moment later they're picking up speed to take off. George
          seems really relaxed. Nothing registers that the jet is
          going faster and faster and taking off.

          

          

          

          

          19.
           As they're having a conversation, Ira seems really freaked
          out. Ira pretends he isn't.

          GEORGE
          I like this joke about watching
          porn and making porn all at the
          same time. That was a good one.

          IRA
          (turning white from

          TAKEOFF)
          Oh good. Yeah, I thought you'd
          like that one. I was really happy
          with that one.

          GEORGE
          You want something to eat? I had
          them bring Chinese on the plane.
          Ira's eyes widen. He likes this way of life.

          INT. BALLROOM - LATER

          DAVE from Apple is walking George and Ira into the room.
          It's a giant room that holds a thousand people at banquet
          tables.
          ON STAGE - Sting is finishing up a set. This is a huge
          corporate event.

          DAVE
          Okay, what do you want them to say
          when he introduces you? Do you
          have any credits he should mention?

          IRA
          (long beat)
          Uh...credits? I don't really have
          any credits. Maybe you could just
          say I've been working on Apples for
          so long, my first one weighed more
          than I did.
          Nobody laughs.

          GEORGE
          And just say he's a friend of mine,
          and I think he's funny.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          INT. STAGE - LATER

          Ira's on stage doing his act. He tells two jokes that don't
          do very well. And then he panics and does the joke about
          jerking off and shooting a movie all at the same time.
          ANGLE ON George, shaking his head, amused that he panicked
          and did one of the jokes he sold to him.
          CUT TO the wings of the stage.
          Ira's walking off stage.

          GEORGE
          What the fuck is that? You did
          three of the jokes that you wrote
          for me.

          IRA
          I panicked. They just wanted jokes
          about computers.

          GEORGE
          That's why I hired you, to write
          jokes about computers.
          Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written.

          IRA
          But there's a lot more. The first
          three on this page. You didn't
          think they would work, but I think
          they will. You should just try
          them.

          GEORGE
          They better kill, I'm getting paid
          a hundred thousand dollars for
          this.

          IRA
          Are you serious?
          ANGLE ON DAVE on stage.

          DAVE
          Ladies and gentleman, George
          Simmons.
          George does a few Apple jokes that do kill, and then he
          segues into his normal act. When he wants to be, he is a
          great performer.

          

          

          

          

          21.

          INT. PLANE - LATER

          George and Ira sit on the plane, on the way back.

          GEORGE
          We'll be on the ground in a half
          hour. Want to go to a bar? Do
          something fun?

          IRA
          Sure. I like fun.

          GEORGE
          Here's a grand for the jokes and
          the gig. Even though you should be
          paying me after that.
          Ira's eyes widen.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Good job.

          IRA
          That's the most money I've ever
          made doing anything in comedy.

          GEORGE
          Then this is an exciting moment.

          IRA
          Well, I didn't make a hundred grand
          like you.

          GEORGE
          I feel nothing. I remember when a
          grand was the most exciting thing
          in the world. I'd go to Red
          Lobster and go nuts. Now it's just
          numbers in a bank account. Enjoy
          tonight. You made a thousand
          bucks.

          MUSIC UP

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          George and Ira enter. People are very excited to see George.
          They give him a nice table.
          -- George and Ira talk to two women, MANDY and DAWN. They
          both seem really into George. Ira feels kind of left out.

          

          

          

          

          22.
          -- George focuses on Mandy, flirting and preparing her to go
          home with him.
          -- The other girl is now talking to a very uncomfortable Ira.
          She is not into it.

          GEORGE
          Hey, let's all go back to my house.

          MANDY
          Great!

          IRA

          (HOPEFUL)
          Yeah, that sounds like a... nice
          idea.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Music is playing. Everybody is drinking. Mandy is doing
          some weird sort of sexy dance for George.

          MANDY
          This house is so big. It's bigger
          than the college I went to.

          GEORGE
          Oh there's a whole other wing that
          you wouldn't even know existed
          unless you went through this door.

          MANDY
          I want to see, I want to see.
          George and Mandy disappear. Ira and Dawn are left alone.

          IRA
          You are very pretty.

          DAWN
          I have a boyfriend. Nothing is
          going to happen.

          IRA
          I didn't say anything was going to
          happen. I just said you were
          pretty. How do you even know I
          wanted something to happen?

          DAWN
          I hope she doesn't take a long
          time.

          

          

          

          

          23.

          INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          George is having sex with Mandy.

          MANDY
          I can't believe I'm having sex with
          Davey!

          GEORGE
          He can't believe he's having sex
          with you.

          INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Ira and Dawn are watching one of George's films. Neither
          looks very happy or comfortable. George enters.

          GEORGE
          Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she
          left.

          DAWN
          Really?

          GEORGE
          Sorry, that kind of stuff happens
          when you have a big house.

          DAWN
          Oh, well then I guess I better get
          going?

          GEORGE
          You don't have to go. I'm just
          saying that she left. I think she
          left her purse in the other wing.
          Come with me, let's go get it.
          Ira watches this, astonished.

          GEORGE (CONT' D )
          Did Ira tell you I have a room with
          all the classic pinball machines
          and video games?

          DAWN
          That sounds awesome.

          GEORGE
          Yeah, I got Galaga. Let's go check
          it out.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          George looks over his shoulder at Ira, as if to say, "A man's
          gotta do what a man's gotta do."

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          (to Ira)
          Hey don't go, I'll be back in a
          second.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

          Ira is now watching the end of the movie by himself. George
          sticks his head in.

          GEORGE
          That girl left. You want to talk
          to me while I try to go to sleep.
          Ira doesn't know what to make of this.

          IRA
          I guess so.

          INT. BEDROOM - LATER

          George is in bed under the covers, comfortably laying on his
          pillow. Ira sits in an easy chair located right next to the
          bed.

          IRA
          Did you have sex with both of those
          girls?

          GEORGE
          I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It
          was just so clear that you were not
          going to get it done. I figured
          you wouldn't mind.

          IRA
          That is crazy. That is super
          crazy.

          GEORGE
          It was great. It was crazy great.

          IRA
          How can that even happen? I guess
          I understand the first one, but why
          would the second one do it? You
          probably stink of the first girl.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          GEORGE
          Well, we took a steam shower
          together.

          IRA
          What?

          GEORGE
          she had never seen a steam shower
          before, I told her she should enjoy
          it.

          IRA
          She wouldn't fool around with me
          because she said she had a
          boyfriend.

          GEORGE
          She told me that too, but she says
          I was on her and her boyfriend's
          list of people she was allowed to
          screw. You'd be surprised how many
          women have me on that list.

          IRA
          I should get going.

          GEORGE
          Just talk to me before I fall
          asleep. I'm weird. I don't like
          being alone. You should crash in
          one of the rooms. You're too drunk
          to drive home. I won't try to fuck
          you, I just fucked two women and
          I'm kind of done.

          IRA
          I may have to whack it in your
          guest room.

          GEORGE
          Whack away, I don't give a shit.

          (BEAT)
          Hey, you were funny tonight. I
          could see how you could get good.

          IRA
          Thanks. That was fun. It was rare
          that I get to play to more than
          twenty-five people. I've never
          played for a thousand.

          26.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          it, s kind of easier, because even
          if two hundred like me, it sounds
          like a lot.

          GEORGE
          I do feel bad for you, because no
          matter how hard you try, you'll
          never be as funny as me.

          IRA
          Why would you say that?

          GEORGE
          Did your dad crack you on the head
          when you were a kid?

          IRA
          No.

          GEORGE
          That's why. My dad always seemed
          annoyed with me. He'd always crack
          me on the head. You would not see
          it coming. I spent my whole
          childhood trying to make my dad
          laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But
          he was an awesome guy. He was the
          coolest. He just got annoyed with
          me. Do you like your parents?
          They can't be that bad, because
          you're not that funny.

          IRA
          They're bananas. And always broke.
          They got divorced ten years ago,
          but they both act like it just
          happened last week. They hate each
          other. They always put me in the
          middle of it. I always wanted them
          to say, "We don't want you to
          suffer through this, so we're just
          going to handle it ourselves."
          They never would do it. They would
          always make me feel their pain all
          the time. I would never do that
          for my kids. Because it's like
          they._`.re kids. And no matter how
          many times I tell them to leave me
          out of it, they never do.
          Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          I'll let you crash.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          GEORGE
          No, keep going. It's interesting.
          Tell me about your day job?

          IRA
          Alright. So...
          (knows he's a sleeping
          pill at this point)
          I work at a supermarket at the deli
          counter. I hate it, but the
          money's actually pretty good.
          Better than you'd think. But I'd
          rather do comedy full-time if I
          could.
          The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin
          to HEAR George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway.

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING

          George walks into the guest room, where Ira is sleeping.

          GEORGE
          Hey man, you want to make me
          breakfast?

          IRA
          okay.

          GEORGE
          Do you know how to cook anything?

          IRA
          Eggs.

          GEORGE
          Okay, let's have some eggs.
          While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills.

          IRA
          What are you doing, man? Are those
          vitamins?

          GEORGE
          No. Medicine. I'm sick.

          IRA
          What do you got?

          

          

          

          

          28.

          GEORGE
          I've got some crazy blood disease.
          They think I'm going to die in six
          months to a year. Some weird
          thing, almost nobody has it. All
          these are experimental.

          IRA
          Are you fucking with me? That's
          not funny, man.

          GEORGE
          No, I'm telling you the truth.

          IRA
          I never heard that before. That
          would be a big deal.

          GEORGE
          I haven't told anybody yet. I
          don't think I'm going to.

          IRA
          You're not going to tell anybody?
          You told me.

          GEORGE
          Well it's easier with you because I
          don't know you. I don't feel weird
          around you. I don't want to be
          treated like a guy who's going to
          die.

          IRA
          I don't know, man. I don't think
          you want to go through this alone.
          I think you've got to tell people.
          Your family. Your friends.

          GEORGE
          Actually, the reason why I only
          told you is I need you to do me a
          favor.

          IRA
          What? Anything, man.

          GEORGE
          I can't imagine suffering through
          the final stages of this. So...I
          was going to ask you if you would
          be willing...to euthanize me.

          

          

          

          

          29.

          IRA
          What does that mean?

          GEORGE
          Kill me. I figured if I found
          someone that nobody knew that was a
          stranger, they could get away with
          it, and I wouldn't have to suffer.
          I got a gun that is untraceable.
          And a silencer. And I thought
          maybe tonight, I would take a bunch
          of sleeping pills, and when I slept
          you would put a bullet in my head.

          IRA
          I can't do that!

          GEORGE
          I'll give you fifty thousand
          dollars in cash. You'd be doing me
          a favor. It would be the kindest
          thing you could ever do for
          somebody.

          IRA
          Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at
          least take a little time to think
          about it?

          GEORGE
          Holy shit, you would do it. You
          were literally thinking about doing
          it!

          IRA
          You're an asshole.

          GEORGE
          I'm an asshole, you were about to
          kill me. For fifty grand! That's
          not even a lot of money.

          IPA
          I just got nervous so I was
          delaying saying no.

          GEORGE
          You basically just told me that you
          were willing to be a murderer.
          While you're cooking me eggs.

          

          

          

          

          30.

          IRA
          That's not cool, man. You told me
          you're going to die and you want me
          to euthanize you. I almost had a
          heart attack.

          GEORGE
          Well, I actually am sick. And I'm
          not going to survive.

          IRA
          Don't do this. My friends do this
          all the time. They trick me, and
          then they trick me again. I'm very
          gullible. Don't do it.

          GEORGE
          I'm not putting you on, man. Just
          don't tell anyone. I mean that. I
          don't want people to know about
          this. I don't want to feel weird.
          Ira nods okay.

          IRA
          Are you religious? Does that give
          you any comfort?

          GEORGE
          Do you really think I'm going to
          sit here and have a theological
          conversation with you?

          IRA
          No.

          GEORGE
          Maybe later, Father Mulcahy.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

          The three friends - Mark, Ira, Leo - smoke pot and have what
          they think is a deep conversation.

          MARK
          That's so sad.

          LEO
          If it was me, I would tell
          everyone. Then everyone would kiss
          my ass. And take care of me. Tell
          me how much they love me.

          Wipe my ass when I had to go to the
          bathroom. They'd be crying and
          sad, and that would make me feel
          really good.

          IRA
          He doesn't want to be that guy. He
          picked up two girls at a bar. Then
          he had sex with his. And then he
          came out and had sex with mine.

          MARK
          In front of you?

          IRA
          No.

          MARK
          So being terminally ill makes you a
          cock-blacker?

          IRA
          No, what I'm saying is...He's so
          lost right now that he's hiding
          from the world. And he's trying to
          distract himself by doing stand-up
          and having sex with a lot of women.
          And he doesn't want anyone to know
          but me.

          MARK
          Why you?

          IRA
          Because he doesn't know me. So he
          doesn't give a shit.

          LEO
          That's kind of insulting.

          IRA
          No, I think we had kind of an
          instant connection.
          The other roommate, JAY, walks by.

          JAY
          You fucked him?

          IRA (CONT'D)
          I feel like he's crying out for
          help, and I can help him. He's
          made us so happy in our lives, this
          is our chance to do something from
          him during this time. There's a
          lot of wisdom we can take from
          this. What he's going through. We
          can apply it to our lives.

          LEO
          Like how to bang two chicks in the
          same night, even though you have a
          terminal disease?

          IRA
          No, what is life all about? What
          is important? How should we decide
          to live this precious life?
          REVEAL that Mark is crying.

          MARK
          Don't talk about this shit when
          we're high. It really freaks me
          out and it makes me sad and it
          scares me. I don't want to talk
          about this shit.

          IRA
          That's why we should talk about it!
          You can't run from it, man. This
          could make us into better people.
          This is an opportunity.

          LEO
          I don't want to talk about this
          shit until I'm 80. I'm 24 years
          old.

          Hello.

          GEORGE
          Hey. You want to see if we can get
          on-stage somewhere?

          IRA
          Sure.

          MUSIC UP

          INT. THE IMPROV - NIGHT

          See quick moments of Ira on stage at the Improv doing a set.

          INT. GEORGE'S JAM ROOM

          George and a few of his friends are playing a famous rock
          song for fun. But they are very good. The music continues
          through the following sequence.

          INT. THE IMPROV - DINING ROOM

          George and Ira are eating with several famous comedians,
          shooting the shit, having a good time.

          EXT. IMPROV -- NIGHT

          George and Ira are waiting at the parking valet. The car
          pulls up. As they get in:

          GEORGE
          I was thinking about it. I could
          throw you some money every week for
          coming up with new jokes for me.
          Maybe you can organize them in the
          computer, keep track of what I'm
          doing.

          IRA
          Absolutely. What do you want to
          pay me?
          They close the doors, drive off.

          GEORGE
          I'll throw you $1500 a week.

          IRA
          Okay, that could work.
          We can tell that this amount of money could change Ira's
          life.

          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM

          George and Ira are writing jokes. Ira keeps pitching
          premises/rough joke ideas that George instantly makes ten
          times better off the top of his head. (We shoot this process
          for real with multiple cameras and try to catch lightning in
          a bottle.)

          IRA
          I was thinking maybe you should do
          some material about what you're
          going through, being sick. There
          could be something really powerful,
          and it would mean a lot to people,
          that you would share that with
          them.

          

          

          

          

          35.

          GEORGE
          I'm just doing stand-up to have
          fun, forget about it on stage.
          There's nothing funny about that.

          IRA
          It could be classic stuff. For the
          ages.

          GEORGE
          Fuck classic stuff. Idon't give a
          shit what people think of my shit
          when I'm dead. Why don't you wait
          till you're about to die and then
          you do a bit about it? I'll bet
          you're about-to-die shit will be
          funnier than my about-to-die shit.

          INT. COMEDY CLUB

          George and Ira are doing sets again.

          INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          George is making a phoney phone call on a speaker phone. Ira
          listens.

          GEORGE
          (Grandmother voice)
          I ordered your Roast Beef. And
          normally it's delicious. But this
          time I paid a price!

          DELI MANAGER
          I'm very sorry ma'am. What if you
          come in and I give you a free
          sandwich?

          GEORGE
          (Grandmother voice)
          Well that's very nice of you. But
          I have one question for you. Can I
          get two sandwiches?
          George motions for Ira to do something.

          IRA
          Grandma! Get off the fucking
          phone. Don't run up my fucking
          bill.

          

          

          

          

          36.
          Ira starts slapping his hands together. George screams in
          pain.

          DELI MANAGER
          Ma'am! Are you okay?

          GEORGE
          (Grandmother voice)
          This is a family matter! He can
          hit me if he wants. He's my
          grandson, and I love him! Now may
          I give you my name, so you have it
          on file so I can get my free
          sandwich? K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U-
          C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you
          get that? Can you say it back to
          me?

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Ira enters.

          IRA
          George? George?
          He walks through the house, finds George in bed. For the
          first time he seems sick.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          Are you all right?

          GEORGE
          No, I had a bad night last night.
          I was sweating though the sheets,
          couldn't stop. So I got up,
          watched half of a season of The
          Wire and then I slept till...what
          time is it now?

          IRA
          It's three in the afternoon.

          GEORGE
          I wanted to get up and do
          something. But I don't think I
          have it in me. I may just go back
          to bed.

          IRA
          Well do you need anything?

          

          

          

          

          37.

          GEORGE
          Yeah, I need all sorts of things.
          But nothing you can get me. You
          should go up anyway. You were in a
          groove the other night, you don't
          want to get rusty.

          IRA
          I. .I. .can't anyway. I'm doing
          the late shift at the deli counter.

          GEORGE
          Really? How long you gonna keep
          that job for? I'm paying you good
          money. What if someone you perform
          in front of goes into Ralph's and
          sees you cutting turkey?

          IRA
          I know, I just want to be safe,
          make sure I can pay my bills. I
          don't like to be nervous about that
          shit.

          GEORGE
          I wasn't like you. I had a
          different theory. You've got to
          spend money to make money. Nothing
          makes you work harder than being in
          debt. Maybe we should go buy a
          Corvette. That'll make you try to
          be funnier.

          INT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET


          CHUCK
          so how much notice are you giving
          me?

          IRA
          Notice? I'm not giving you any
          notice. I'm just quitting.

          CHUCK
          You're supposed to give notice.
          That's what people do.

          IRA
          Why would I give you notice? I'm
          not trying to stay in Ralph's good
          graces. I'm not trying to preserve
          my good standing at Ralph's.

          38.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          I'm just quitting. You don't quit
          and then keep working for two
          weeks.

          CHUCK
          Well I don't have enough people to
          cover all your shifts, now I gotta
          cover them.

          IRA
          I wish I could help you, but I'll
          kill myself if I keep working here.
          It's not what I want to do. Maybe
          Gail can cover my shifts.

          CHUCK
          Gail can't work weekends, and my
          kid's birthday is this weekend.
          What am I supposed to do?

          IRA
          I don't know. Get someone to cover
          from a different Ralph's. There
          are thousands of them in Southern
          California. No one else can scoop
          macaroni into a bowl? I'm not the
          linchpin that keeps Ralph's from
          falling into chaos.

          CHUCK
          You're an asshole. You always
          thought you were slumming it here.
          Go tell your tucking fart jokes.,
          Get the fuck out of here before I
          kick the shit out of you.

          IRA
          You know what? I'm glad you said
          that, because I was about to tell
          you I could work this weekend.
          What's your problem? I didn't say
          anything bad about you, I just said
          I didn't want to work for Ralph's
          anymore.
          Chuck takes a step to Ira like he's going to hit him. Ira
          steps back a few feet.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          I'll tell Dave. I'll tell Dave. I
          tried to do this politely. The
          thanks I get.

          

          

          

          

          39.
          Ira walks out the store. As he walks out, he turns to a lady
          (in her 40s) at the register.

           IRA (CONT'D)
          See you, Phyllis. You're nice.

          EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

          Ira sees Daisy walking out as he's walking into the apartment
          complex. He takes a deep breath, then:

          IRA
          Hey, Daisy.

          DAISY
          Hey --

           IRA
          Ira.

          DAISY
          (she doesn't)
          I know.

          IRA
          I was gonna try to hunt down
          tickets to see Wilco at the Greek
          Theatre. You want to come? Are
          you into them at all?

          DAISY
          I would love to come. That would
          be amazing.

          IRA
          Okay. I'll call you with the
          details. Hopefully I'll be able to
          get seats which will not require
          high-powered binoculars.

          DAISY
          I don't care where the seats are.
          I just like to close my eyes and
          listen to the music at concerts,

          IRA
          Perfect. Then I can play you their
          live album in my car and trick you
          into thinking we have front row
          seats.
          (laughing uncomfortably)
          That won't work.

          That wasn't funny at all. I'm
          gonna leave while I'm ahead right
          now.
          She smiles. He walks away.

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE

          Ira walks into George's house.

          IRA
          George?
          Ira walks into George's bedroom. He hears something, pokes
          his head in.
          In the dark, he can barely see George making phoney calls by
          himself. Ira listens for awhile, not sure what to make of
          this. George doesn't see him.

          GEORGE
          (speaking like an old

          WOMAN)
          I was robbed! One second you're
          walking down the street with your
          Visa card, having a grand old time,
          and then you've got a fucking gun
          in your mouth!

          VISA LADY
          What's the number of the card,
          Ma'am?

          GEORGE
          I don't know! The thief has the
          card, why don't you ask the thief
          the number of the card!
          George hangs up the phone. He starts dialing.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          (as a Texan)
          Ah yes, I came into your comedy
          club tonight and I was very
          offended by the performer. I did
          not pay good money to have the so-
          called "comedian" shake my wife's
          hand, then smell it and say, "Did
          you have fish for dinner?" That is
          not my idea of entertainment.
          Ira leaves the room, feeling like he's intruded on a private
          moment.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          INT. RED LOBSTER RESTAURANT

          George and Ira are eating.

          IRA
          I was thinking you need to tell
          someone about your situation... your
          condition.

          GEORGE
          No, no. IÃ¢â¬Â¢ don't want to do that.

          IRA
          I feel like maybe you're holding
          everything in and I can understand
          why you don't want to deal with it
          because why would anyone want to
          deal with it. But I bet you have a
          lot of unfinished business with
          your friends. Wouldn't it make you
          feel a lot better to get your
          affairs in order? What do people
          do at this moment Don't they have
          to do stuff?

          GEORGE
          I don't want to do anything. I
          just want to be in the moment and
          live every day the best I can. As
          soon as I confront it with
          everybody, everything's changed and
          I can't get back.

          IRA
          Everything has changed. At some
          point you're going to get really
          sick and you need your friends and
          family around you. I'm sure
          there's a lot of business, estate
          issues, I don't know. Maybe you'll
          feel better than if you just deal
          with everything. Where are your
          parents?

          GEORGE
          P4y parents would drop dead if I
          told them what was happening.
          They're in their 80s. They don't
          have to go through this. I'll make
          sure they find out at the last
          possible second.

          

          

          

          

          42.

          IRA
          Friends?

          GEORGE
          I don't think I do. I thought I
          did. I got a lot of people I know,
          shoot the shit with, fuck around
          with. But I realized when this
          happened I'm not close to anyone.
          I had no one to call. My
          friendships are Hollywood
          friendships. When I was lying in
          bed I couldn't think of one person
          I wanted to share this with. Maybe
          it's me, maybe I never got close to
          anybody.

          IRA
          I think if you talk to people you'd
          find out a lot of people care about
          you. You're kind of old already, I
          mean, compared to me. I'm sure you
          touched a lot of people's lives.
          You can't spend the rest of your
          days making phoney phone calls
          alone in your room.

          GEORGE
          The only reason I did that was
          because I couldn't sleep. And I
          had no one to call.

          IRA
          Well maybe that's the problem.
          Maybe if you told more people you'd
          have more people to call. You
          can't just talk to me about it, I
          don't know what the fuck I'm
          talking about. You're the first
          person I've known who's sick. I'm
          not good at it.
          (eyes beginning to well

          UP)
          You've given me diarrhea, I'm
          nervous about you and I'm in over
          my head.

          GEORGE
          (his eyes begin to well

          UP)
          Don't cry in front of me, man. I
          can't start that.

          

          

          

          

          43.

          IRA
          I'm sorry.

          GEORGE
          Seriously. I can't...I can't have
          you do that.
          George really begins to cry.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Please don't do that.

          IRA
          (tears streaming down his

          FACE)
          I won't do it, I promise, man.
          Ira wipes the tears from his face. New tears immediately
          come out.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          That was first and last time. I'm
          not even crying anymore.

          GEORGE

          (CRYING)
          You're still crying.

          IRA
          (tears coming down)
          I don't think I am. I think I'm
          not anymore. I'm not sure what
          you're talking about.

          GEORGE
          Okay, as long as we got that
          straight.
          George takes a napkin and puts it over his face.

          IRA
          I'm sorry, George. I really don't
          know what to do, I don't know how
          to help you.

          GEORGE
          (his face still in the

          NAPKIN)
          No, you're right. I really should
          tell some people. It just sucks,
          man. It just sucks. And they're
          going to feel so bad, I don't even
          want to look at them and tell them.

          I'd rather drop dead. of a heart
          attack and have someone else make
          the calls. I have to make those
          calls? This is a nightmare. This
          is a total nightmare.

          IRA
          Do you want me to call them, and
          tell them what's going on?

          GEORGE
          Yeah.

          IRA
          Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna
          say no.

          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM

          Ira is on the phone. There is a paper with a bunch of
          numbers in front of him.

          IRA
          (into the phone)
          Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of
          George's. He asked me to call you.
          His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the
          receiver.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          Will you guys shut the fuck up?
          Shut the fuck up!
          Ira slam the door.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          (into phone)
          I'm sorry. I have some news about
          George.

          TELLING FRIENDS SEQUENCE

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          George sits with THREE COMEDIANS. They are all laughing and
          telling old sex stories from george's younger days. Ira sits
          with them and listens and laughs along.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          GEORGE
          So I left the phone off the hook so
          he could hear me doing it.

          COMEDIAN #1
          That's very gay.

          COMEDIAN#2
          No, it was a buddy thing. It was
          very heterosexual.

          GEORGE
          Admit it, you were masturbating.

          COMEDIAN#2
          Of course I was whacking it. What
          else am I gonna do, not whack it?

          GEORGE
          And I kept making her talk and say
          crazy shit just to make him laugh.

          COMEDIAN #2
          I think at one point you said, "Say
          my hog is the biggest you've ever
          seen." And then there is this long
          pause.

          COMEDIAN#3
          That's a bad sign. If it was big
          at all she wouldn't have paused.

          COMEDIAN #1
          Remember you used to have that joke
          about how you used to only date
          midgets because your dick looked
          bigger in their little hands.
          They all laugh.

          COMEDIAN #2
          Yeah, you used to get all the
          girls, man.
          Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and
          sad.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          George is talking to an EX-MANAGER and his WIFE.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          EX-MANAGER
          And I feel horrible about it, but
          the truth is, I was having some
          issues with gambling, and you were
          doing so well-and so I took a
          million dollar check you got in
          from the studio and I used it to
          clear up some debts. And I did it
          with the intention of paying you
          right back before you noticed. But
          you never noticed, and I just never
          got around to paying you back.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Allen Covert yells at George for abandoning him.

          COVERT
          You fucking blew us off. You
          cocksucker.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          George is talking to his sister, LISA.

          LISA
          You have to tell mom and dad.

          GEORGE
          I will tell them, but right at the
          end. I don't want them to go
          through all this. I can't put them
          through this.

          LISA
          I wish I wasn't so mad at you. I
          want to be there for you, but I am
          so mad at you.

          GEORGE
          I wish I was a better brother.

          LISA
          You weren't even a brother. You
          just left when I was a little kid.
          You left me there all alone, and
          you never treated me like a sister
          again.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          GEORGE
          You live so far away. I visited
          you in Kansas a few years ago.

          LISA
          That was six years ago, and you
          were only there because you had a
          concert. My five-year-old has
          never even met you.
          George does not know what to say.

          LISA (CONT'D)
          And I wanted to bring her, but then
          I thought she would just fall in
          love with you and get attached, and
          then what? I didn't want to do
          that to her.

          INT. KITCHEN

          George and Ira talk in the kitchen while making beverages.

          GEORGE
          Thanks a lot, pal. This is
          everything I didn't want to happen.
          It's like being at my own funeral.

          IRA
          Afterwards you'll be happy you did
          it.

          GEORGE
          No, I won't.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          George talks to a FRIEND who rambles on and on talking about
          his own problems, ignoring George's.

          FRIEND
          It is such a tucked up situation.
          Life is fucked. It makes no sense.

          GEORGE
          Well, I really appreciate you
          coming by.

          FRIEND
          This is why I can't be close with
          people. What is the point?

          

          

          

          

          48.

          GEORGE
          Exactly. Well, I really need to
          rest...

          FRIEND
          The worst part is at night, when
          the TV gets turned off, and it is
          quiet...

          GEORGE
          It was so good to see you.
          George stands up and exits the room. Ira walks over.

          IRA
          I think George is going to take a
          nap now.

          FRIEND
          Oh, okay.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          A different FRIEND is talking about their own health issues.
          He goes on and on about his surgeries and treatments. George
          doesn't say a word.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          George is talking to BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.

          BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
          You're about to merge with the
          eternal. We're all going to die.
          No one gets out of here alive,
          right?
          George nods.

           BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (CONT'D)
           You lived five lives, fucker.
          You're 200 years old in my book.
           The fun you've had, the money, the
          adventures, the women you've known.
          Who wouldn't want to change places
          with you right new?

          GEORGE
          I guess so, but...

          

          

          

          

          49.

          BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
          You know what? There is no
          tomorrow, no yesterday. Only right
          now, and it's fucking beautiful.

          GEORGE

          (BEAT)
          You need to shut the fuck up right
          now. Have you been browsing the
          self-help section at Barnes and
          Noble? Is this what you say in
          between songs these days? I'm
          going to go right now and delete
          all your songs off my iPod.

          BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
          I'm sorry. I didn't know what to
          say. I just got nervous.

          INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM

          Ira is talking George to sleep. He's gotten good at it.
          Warren Zevon's "Don't Let Us Get Sick" plays in the
          background.

          GEORGE
          This is awful. Awful. I hate you
          for having me do this.

          IRA
          You have to, you have no choice.
          You're doing good. And you're
          almost done, don't worry.

          GEORGE
          Well what are we going to do when
          it's over, when we're done
          tomorrow? Because then I'm not
          talking to anyone.

          IRA
          I was thinking we should go skiing
          somewhere. You're still physically
          doing well, and that's not going to
          last forever. You should do
          something active. Go to Colorado,
          or Tahoe, or something. Or do
          something crazy. Go to Switzerland,
          or Sweden, or wherever they have
          mountains.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          50.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          I don't know, I don't even ski, but
          you do. Maybe you should do
          something like that.
          Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more
          quietly. He's gotten good at this.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          If it's too hard, we can just ski
          for an hour or two a day, and then
          get drunk at the bar. You can hit
          on hot ski instructors, and then I
          can masturbate in the room thinking
          about you fucking hot ski
          instructors.
          He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the
          mountain air, fun to look at the
          mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even
          be here. We can hang out there as
          long as you want, I got nothing to
          do.
          Ira closes the door.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          George is talking to LAURA, a very pretty woman in her late
          thirties. Laura is showing George a photo of her two
          daughters.

          GEORGE
          Thanks for coming down. You didn't
          have to do that, i appreciate it.

          LAURA
          I wanted to, I wanted to see you.

          GEORGE
          I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for
          everything I did to you.

          LAURA
          You don't have to be sorry, that
          was like 12 years ago. Everything
          worked out for the best.
          We see this hurts George.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          GEORGE
          I screwed everything up. I could
          have been married to you now.

          LAURA
          Don't do this.

          GEORGE
          We could've had a family . I don't
          have a family, I'm all alone here.

          LAURA
          (tearing up)
          I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for
          what's happening to you.

          GEORGE
          You know, maybe I deserve it. I
          screwed up the only good thing that
          ever happened in my life. I
          cheated on you. For no reason at
          all. Just young and stupid. And
          selfish. I'm sorry.

          LAURA
          Maybe I over reacted. I didn't
          have to leave you.

          GEORGE
          Yes you did.
          ANGLE ON: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes
          coffee.

          LAURA
          And the funny thing is...my
          husband, he is on the road a lot
          for business. He did the same
          thing last year.

          GEORGE
          Did you leave him?

          LAURA
          No. I have kids now.

          GEORGE
          See, that was my mistake. I should
          have had some kids with you before
          I cheated.
          she laughs.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          LAURA
          You were the one and only magic
          relationship in. my life.
          She starts to cry. He does too. They embrace.

          GEORGE
          Me too.
          They cry, forehead to forehead.

          LAURA
          There's never been anything like
          you before or since. I love Chris,
          but it's not the same. It's fine,
          maybe it isn't even fine, but we
          had something special.

          GEORGE
          I'm so sorry. I really loved you.
          And I do love you.

          LAURA
          I love you too George. I wish
          there was something I could do.

          GEORGE
          Don't set me up for jokes like
          that. You're ruining the moment.
          She smiles. They hug.

          INT. IRA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ira comes home, deep in the evening. He's eating some food.
          Daisy walks out of Mark's bedroom, dressed in Mark's long-
          sleeve t-shirt. She's clearly just had sex.

          IRA
          Hey. How's it going?

          DAISY
          Good.
          Mark walks out in a bathrobe.

          MARK
          Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were
          sleeping at your boyfriend's again
          tonight.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          IRA
          I guess it's been more than ten
          days.

          MARK
          It's been 21 days. I gave you an
          extra 11.

          DAISY
          What are you guys talking about?

          IRA
          Don't worry about it, it doesn't
          matter, I don't give a shit.
          Leo walks in the front door.

          LEO
          I just fucking killed at the
          Improv. Bud Freidman fucking loves
          me.
          Leo realizes he's walked into the middle of an awkward
          moment.

          LEO (CONT' D )

          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
          They said they're gonna start
          giving me good spots on the
          weekends.

          IRA
          I've been getting good weekend
          spots.

          LEO
          Well, that's because they think if
          they book you, George will show up.

          IRA
          What's with you guys? You both
          want to fuck my mother too? What
          more do you want to do to me
          tonight?
          Ira walks away.

          LEO
          I really did kill.
          (a beat)
          Did you guys just bone, or
          something?

          LEO (CONT'D)
          I'm getting a little vibe here.
          It's getting me excited.

          EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

          Ira and Daisy are having a heated conversation outside.

          IRA
          So now you're with Mark? You're
          his girl?

          DAISY
          I just went out with him one night.

          IRA
          You got a lot accomplished in one
          night. How did this happen?

          DAISY
          He invited me to a taping of his
          show and we hit it off.

          IRA
          Must have been a great episode. I
          should get a job on a shitty show
          so I can use it as foreplay.

          DAISY
          What are you talking about? Don't
          treat me like that.

          IRA
          I am not treating you like
          anything. Do what you want. I
          don't give a shit. I'll go to Wilco
          alone.

          DAISY
          What planet are you from? The one
          where everyone is perfect like you,
          you judgemental fuck?

          IRA
          How could you do that? I thought
          we were going out on a date.

          DAISY
          We are going on a date. I didn't
          plan it. Am I not allowed to do
          stuff because we're going out on a
          .date? What the fuck's the matter
          with you?

          

          

          

          

          55.

          IRA
          I bought tickets to Wilco and I
          worked all week to get a
          reservation at a place that doesn't
          normally let people like me eat
          there. I just didn't see this
          coming. Yes, you're right. You
          can do anything you want. I'm glad
          this fucking happened, before I
          wasted the night with you. I
          didn't think you were that kind of
          person. That you would sleep with
          a guy like that.

          DAISY
          He's your roommate. You don't like
          him?

          IRA
          No, I think he's a pussyhound.

          DAISY
          Well, I didn't know that. Thanks
          for the info. I wasn't trying to
          hurt you. It just happened.

          IRA
          You got excited because he's the
          star of the show. You literally
          star-fucked.

          DAISY
          Yes, you're right. I'm awful.

          (CRYING)
          Give me a break. I don't even know
          you.

          INT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Ira goes into the house. Mark is there.

          MARK
          I told you I was going to give you
          10 days. That was three weeks ago.

          IRA
          I thought you were joking.

          MARK
          I didn't know she actually mattered
          to you. We talk about girls we
          want to fuck all the time.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          IRA
          I just bought these two Wilco
          tickets. Wanna go?

          MARK
          I would, but I'm going with Tobey
          Maguire. He wants me to play his
          younger brother in some movie.

          EXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY

          George and Ira are skiing. There is no music, no noise. It
          is very peaceful. George stops in a spot where he is
          surrounded in all directions by gorgeous, majestic mountains.
          He looks around, taking it all in.

          INT. SKI LODGE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          George and Ira are watching videotapes of George doing stand-
          up when he was much younger. He's really, really funny. And
          very skinny, with a much more pronounced New York accent.

          GEORGE
          You know, I never got married. I
          never had kids. I didn't get to do
          a lot of things I thought I would
          do. But I was pretty fucking
          funny, right?

          IRA
          Come on, are you kidding me? We
          all want to be you. Most of my
          comic friends are just doing a bad
          impression of you. People love
          your shit.

          GEORGE
          Well, I made a lot of people laugh.
          I guess that's something.

          IRA
          It's a lot.

          GEORGE
          Yeah. I guess so.
          They watch some more and we see a really happy, young George
          getting big laughs with something really silly.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Look at that crazy motherfucker.

          

          

          

          

          57.
          George and Ira start watching the act and laughing along,
          like any audience member.

          INT. JAM ROOM - DAY

          George is singing a happy song with a bunch of musician
          friends, like a Lou Reed/Velvet Underground (or Ramones/New
          York Dolls/Clash/Warren Zevon/Paul McCartney) song. This
          music plays over the following montage.

          MONTAGE

          EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY

          George walks around his grounds, slowly. And one gets the
          sense he's never looked around and seen where he lives
          before. He likes it.

          INT. IMPROV - NIGHT

          George performs at the Improv. We see him gesture to a woman
          that she can come up on stage and she hugs him. The crowd
          erupts. She runs back to her seat. George continues with
          his act.

          EXT. SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS - DAY

          George and Ira hike up a hill.

          GEORGE
          I never understood why people hiked
          before. I think I get it now.

          IRA

          (SWEATING)
          I don't.

          INT. RESTAURTANT - DAY

          George and Ira have an uncomfortable dinner with George's
          angry sister, Lisa.

          INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          George is in bed, sleeping. Ira starts sneaking out. George
          wakes up, calls Ira back to keep talking to him.

          

          

          

          

          58.

          EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

          George is walking around his yard at night. He's clearly
          never walked the grounds at night. He seems at peace.

          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Lisa and her husband are now over, and George is talking to
          them and playing with her two-year-old boy.

          EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE

          George is sitting with his parents. It is clear he recently
          told them about his situation, and although there is sadness
          in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in
          a long time.
          George says something that makes his DAD laugh.

          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM

          Ira is asleep on the couch. George walks over with a bowl of
          ice cream. He whacks Ira a few times trying to wake him up,
          but Ira keeps snoring. George sits down next to the sleeping
          Ira and watches TV while eating his ice cream.

          EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

           George and Ira play basketball. Ira is awful.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          Ira is making breakfast. George is all dressed for the day.

          IRA
          What are you doing?

          GEORGE
          I'm feeling good, so I'm going to
          the doctor.

          IRA
          You're not feeling good?

          GEORGE
          No, I'm feeling good. It's kind of
          weirding me out.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          59.

          GEORGE (CONT-D)
          I don't feel sick at all, and it's
          scaring me. I feel like I'm just
          going to drop dead. Am I not going
          to feel bad at all, and then one
          day wake up dead? It's
          disconcerting.

          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE


          DOCTOR STEVENS
          I don't want to get your hopes up.
          We put you on this experimental
          medication without much optimism,
          but as of right now I don't see any
          traces of the disease in your blood
          work. I don't want to speak too
          soon, but we may have beaten this
          thing.

          GEORGE
          Well what the fuck do I do now?

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Ira's eyes are wide with shock.

          IRA
          Oh my god, oh my god!
          Ira goes to hug George, but it's a very awkward moment. Ira
          really wants a happy hug, but George is instantly
          uncomfortable.

          TNT. OFFICE
          George is sitting at his computer. Ira is also seated.

          GEORGE
          I really want to thank you for your
          help through this time.

          IRA
          I was happy to help.

          GEORGE
          Well, you didn't have to, and you
          were really there for me. I was
          thinking, maybe we should write a
          movie together.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          IRA
          Uh-huh.

          GEORGE
          I feel like I've learned a lot, and
          I wanna use this good place I'm in
          right now to do something really
          creative. I would pay you,
          certainly. I make, you know, about
          a million dollars to write a
          script. I can't give you half, but
          maybe one hundred, two hundred
          grand, but we'll figure it out.

          IRA
          (what?)
          Yeah, we'll figure it out.

          GEORGE
          I thought a lot about my work when
          I was sick and I'm in sort of a
          strange place career-wise, because
          I'm normally the goofy, funny guy
          and I don't know if people are
          expecting a change from me. And I
          think people are expecting me to
          evolve, and it's important to
          evolve before they make a point of
          asking me why I'm not evolving.

          IRA
          It's always good to keep breaking
          new ground.

          GEORGE
          Is that something they taught you
          at the deli. I'm not asking you
          for your advice, I just though we
          could start trying to come up with
          an idea.

          IRA
          Well, I'm gonna start thinking.
          And...I'm really happy for you.
          Are you freaking out right now?

          GEORGE
          It's very strange. It's gonna take
          me a few days to process it, but
          it's a gift and I'm going to treat
          it that way.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          61.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I learned a lot from being sick and
          it's gonna help me make some good
          choices, and be a good person from
          now on.

          INT. IRA'S PARENT'S DINING ROOM

          Ira is eating with his fairly young MOM and his step-father

          BOB.

          IRA
          And he thanked me for helping him,
          and I really think I was a help
          during this time. I'm not saying
          that's why he got better, but he
          definitely had good energy and I
          hear that helps your immune system.

          MOM
          He's going to pay you two hundred
          thousand dollars to write a movie
          script?

          IRA
          I don't know, he said one or two
          hundred thousand.

          BOB
          One or two hundred thousand?
          That's pretty vague. That's a wide
          range. I'd push him toward two
          hundred thousand if I were you.

          IRA
          Thank you for the advice, Bob.
          That's very helpful.

          MOM
          This is good because now you can
          help with your sister's college
          tuition.

          IRA
          What are you talking about?

          MOM
          Your younger sister got accepted to
          Boston University but, as you know,
          your father and I aren't in the
          position to pay for it.

          

          

          

          

          62.

          IRA
          So I have to? I just stopped
          working at a supermarket two weeks
          ago. I'm trying to create some
          financial stability for myself.
          The first time I make any real
          money, I can't just give it to her.

          BOB
          Well that's very selfish.

          IRA
          Well you guys went on a cruise to
          Greece last year. Maybe you
          shouldn't have gone, and saved for
          her college education.

          MOM
          Oh, so after all we've done for
          you, we can't have any fun? We
          should never take a vacation?

          IRA
          I had to drop out of college after
          two years because you couldn't pay
          for it. Now I have to pay for
          hers? Let her figure it out. Let
          her get a job.

          BOB
          I didn't realize I raised such a
          selfish boy. When I was young I
          would have done anything for my
          family.

          IRA
          Then sell your house. Move into a
          smaller house. Use the extra money
          to pay for her college. Or tell
          her to work for a year or two, make
          some money, then she can pay for
          her own college. No one helped me
          out, I'm just digging out from
          under now.

          BOB
          Don't get so high up on your horse
          with all your Hollywood friends. I
          don't like what you're turning
          into.

          

          

          

          

          63.

          IRA
          One good thing happens to me in my
          entire life, and you have to try
          and take it away and ruin it.

          MOM
          I don't even know where you came
          from.

          BOB
          Don't bother showing up for
          Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is just
          for families.

          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Ira is on his computer. Leo and Mark are watching.

          IRA
          (typing as he talks)
          Hey George, we're doing an Orphan's
          Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want
          to come? It's just for us losers
          who don't have any family to eat
          with.

          LEO
          He's not gonna email back.

          MARK
          He's never gonna want to eat
          Thanksgiving with us.
          The computer BINGS. The guys scream in delight.

          IRA
          (reading email)
          Sure. What time? Do you need me
          to bring anything?
          (types back)
          3 O'clock at my apartment. Bring
          wine that we can't afford.
          The computer bings.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          (reading email)
          That's pretty much all wine on
          earth. See you then.

          

          

          

          

          64.

          MARK

          (EXCITED)
          Email back and say:
          (trying to make a joke)
          If you can, bring that hot chick
          from your last movie. We
          definitely have room for her.

          (ALT)
          Well, then maybe just bring grain
          alcohol then.
          They all start laughing. The computer BINGS again.

          IRA
          (reading it)
          Hey Faggots, I know what you're
          doing. Stop emailing me. It's not
          amusing anymore.
          They all start high--fiving.

          LEO
          He called us faggots!

          INT. IRA'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Mark and Leo are doing the cooking. There a few other
          comedians (male and female) floating around the apartment.
          Ira watches the parade on TV.
          Daisy walks up, site down next to Ira.

          DAISY
          What have you been up to? I
          haven't seen you at the Improv.

          IRA
          I've just been busy. Will you
          excuse me?
          Ira gets up, walks out of the room.

          EXT./INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          George walks up, rings the bell. Inside the apartment he
          hears a bit of a scuffle, as if the friends are fighting over
          who can open the door.
          Leo opens the door, sweaty, with a welt on his face.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          LEO
          Hey, George. How are you? Come on
          in.
          Then Mark appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on
          his neck.

          MARK
          Happy Thanksgiving? Come on in.

          INT. IRA'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - LATER

          Everyone is seated around the table. It's very awkward due
          to George's presence. It seems to suck the air out of the
          room.

          LEO
          We're really glad you could come
          have Thanksgiving with us. It's a
          big thrill.

          GEORGE
          It's weird, I feel like the old guy
          in the room. When I started out I
          was always the young guy. It's
          strange how fast you become the old
          guy. And I feel exactly the same.

          MARK
          Well, you don't know us, but you're
          with friends and admirers.

          GEORGE
          I know you, I've watched your show.
          "'Nuff Said." It's a good show.

          IRA
          You don't have to lie to him. He
          knows it's not good.

          GEORGE
          No, it's good, it's cute. I like
          it.

          MARK

          (BASHFUL)
          I know it's not that funny, but
          they do slip in some funny shit in
          there every now and again.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          GEORGE
          Don't be ashamed, it's good. But
          what about that girl on the show?
          How old is she? Tell me she's 25.

          MARK
          No, she's 15.

          GEORGE
          Holy shit! I feel bad. I don't
          want to tell you what I did
          watching that show. Are you
          serious? She's 15?

          MARK
          No, she's actually 20.

          GEORGE
          Okay, good. Now I don't feel so
          bad.
          Their weird friend, FUTORAN, pipes up.

          FUTORAN
          I heard you were sick and now
          you're better. Is that like,
          really... what's that like?

          GEORGE
          It's kinda like 9/11. You know
          after 9/11 you kind of liked
          everybody? But then it went away.
          It's like that.

          LEO
          Did you think you were gonna go to
          heaven? Did you count up your
          sins?

          GEORGE
          I don't believe in any of that
          stuff, but I was hoping I was
          headed somewhere. I felt like I
          was.

          FUTORAN
          I think you just wind up in the
          dirt. Worm food.

          IRA
          Come on, Futoran, we're about to
          eat.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          GEORGE
          Well, it's easy to think that way
          until you're headed for the dirt.
          Then your mind opens up a little
          bit, you know? Maybe it's
          desperation, or maybe you just
          start to see more of the big plan.
          Luckily I got a little more time
          before I find out.
          Daisy pops her head into the room.

          DAISY
          Food's ready.

          GEORGE
          May I say the prayer?
          Everyone nods yes.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Everyone hold hands. Thank you for
          the gifts this year. Thank you for
          (this.) And thank you for (that.)
          And hopefully next year I'll get to
          screw that girl on Mark's show.
          All our dreams will come true. You
          guys will get an apartment with
          less pubic hair on the toilet seat,
          you'll be able to afford a maid.
          Maybe next year you guys can get a
          better celebrity than me. Maybe
          Wolf Blitzer will come. I also
          pray that no one put their balls on
          this turkey, I'm kind of scared you
          guys are about to give me
          salmonella poisoning. I know this
          Orphan's Thanksgiving it's just a
          normal Thanksgiving for you guys,
          but it's a very special one for me.
          I'm very glad to be here. I'm not
          that glad to be here with you, but
          I thank you for having me. I'm
          sure it will be very memorable for
          you. Now let's find out what Leo's
          balls taste like.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

          Everyone's sitting down watching the football game. George
          motions to Ira, and then looks at Daisy as if to say, "Is
          that the girl you used to like?"

          

          

          

          

          68.

          GEORGE
          (points at Ira)
          This guy wrote me some funny jokes
          for that Mac gig. I asked for some
          jokes and he sent me about a
          hundred. Seriously.
          (points at Leo)
          This guy sent me jack shit. If you
          want to succeed you need a work
          ethic like Ira over here.

          LEO
          Why wouldn't I have sent you jokes?
          You didn't ask me for jokes.

          GEORGE
          Sure I did. I asked you and Ira to
          write me jokes and you flaked.
          Leo's eyes widen with anger.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          (to Daisy)
          Ira wrote this joke about Leopard,
          it was really funny. Do the joke,
          Ira.

          IRA
          I don't want to right now.

          GEORGE
          It was like, what's great about.
          Leopard is you can watch a porno,
          write a porno, shoot a porno, and
          order a porno all at the same time.
          This guy's fucking funny.
          Leo jumps up suddenly and walks out of the room without
          saying anything. Ira watches him go, concerned.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          (to Daisy and Ira)
          You guys look like a cute couple,
          you should go out.

          DAISY
          well, the truth is we had a date,
          but I went out with Mark first and
          he broke it off.

          

          

          

          

          69.

          IRA
          I didn't expect you to blurt it out
          like that. That was very honest of
          you.

          GEORGE
          If I didn't go out with every girl
          one of my friends slept with... let
          me put it another way. If none of
          my friends went out with girls I
          went out with, none of them would
          have gotten laid.

          (THEN)
          So, are you guys dating now?

          DAISY
          No.

          IRA
          This is making me uncomfortable.
          The whole thing, it makes me
          uncomfortable.

          GEORGE
          You guys are young, why are you
          taking everything so seriously? As
          someone who's been through a lot
          recently, let me tell you
          something. The worst thing you can
          do is hold grudges and be
          judgmental. Everyone's making
          mistakes, everyone's screwing up.
          You guys are cute together.
          George points at Mark.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I know that Mark's not good in bed.
          Don't tell me he was a good lay.
          He can't have a big dick. Look at
          Ira. He's thick. He's gotta have
          a thick dick.

          DAISY
          Actually, I have a really skinny
          vagina, so I'm not really into
          thick.

          GEORGE
          See? She's funny. She can take a
          joke, she's not sensitive. I think
          I'm falling in love with both of
          you.

          

          

          

          

          70.
          George stands.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna walk away now, causing an
          awkward moment, that will be
          followed by a true moment, filled
          with chemistry. I'm walking away
          now. Let the awkwardness begin.
          George walks out of the room.

          DAISY
          My brother's going to freak out
          that I met Davey.
          (to Ira)
          Did you go to the Wilco show?

          IRA
          I actually scalped them and made a
          hundred bucks.

          DAISY
          Well at last you didn't lose any
          money on the deal.

          IRA
          I'm sorry I got so upset with you,
          because it shows you how much I
          like you, which is weird because
          we've hardly spoken. I understand
          all of that.

          DAISY
          Well, attraction is all about
          smells, pheromones.

          IRA
          Well, you smell right to me.
          Daisy smiles at Ira, just as Leo stomps back into the room.
          He charges right up to Ira, pissed off.

          LEO
          You're a fucking prick, You're a
          piece of shit thief motherfucker.
          You stole a job from me, you stole
          my joke.

          DAISY
          You stole his joke?

          

          

          

          
          7l.
          The moment is ruined. Ira doesn't know what to say.

           CUT TO:

          INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Leo pulls Ira into the other room and goes off on him.

          LEO
          He asked for me to write jokes too
          and you didn't tell me!

          IRA
          Uh...yes.

          LEO
          You .fucker!

          IRA
          I didn't think you would want to.

          LEO
          Why wouldn't I want to? What, I
          don't like money? I don't like
          private jets?

          IRA
          I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the
          gig. And you are doing so much
          better than me. I guess I just
          wanted this for myself.

          LEO
          It wasn't yours to keep for
          yourself. You lied to me.

          IRA
          I did. And it was fucked up. And
          I am sorry. I don't know what to
          say.

          LEO
          Don't say anything. Just get your
          shit, and get out of the apartment.

          IRA
          Are you serious?

          LEO
          You don't get let off the hook for
          going into faggy apology mode.
          That is a terrible strategy.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          72.

          LEO (CONT'D)
          I don't know what the fuck has
          happened to you--but my name is on
          the lease, and I don't want to live
          with it.

          INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Ira is mad at George for bringing up the jokes.

          IRA
          I never told Leo because I wanted
          the gig?

          GEORGE
          I didn't know you were fucking over
          your friend. Don't yell at me.

          IRA
          Well I fucking live with you now
          because he told me to leave.

          GEORGE
          He kicked you out for that.

          IRA
          He said friends don't lie and I'm
          fucking with his career.

          GEORGE
          Well in a way that's a compliment
          to me because he's so mad he can't
          hang out with me that's he mad at
          you. That's kind of cool. I got
          you kicked out.

          IRA
          Fuck off.

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Ira is unpacking a dufflebag of clothes he grabbed from his
          apartment when he was kicked out. George pops his head in.

          GEORGE
          This should be comfortable in here.
          This room is almost as big as your
          old apartment.

          IRA
          (through gritted teeth)
          Thank you for letting me stay here.

          

          

          

          

          7 3 .

          GEORGE
          No problem. Hey, you want to come
          talk to me while I crash?

          IRA
          No. You want to come talk to me
          while I crash?

          CUT TO:

          INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          George is under the covers. He turns on the TV and he
          changes channels until he finds "Charlie Rose." They're
          interviewing a reporter from the New York Times about
          America's policy towards Pakistan.

          GEORGE
          All right, Charlie. Talk to me.
          George closes his eyes.

          INT. MANAGEMENT COMPANY - DAY

          George stands in the reception area.

          RECEPTIONIST
          Terry's ready for you.

          INT. TERRY DOWD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER


          GEORGE
          I was thinking that now might be a
          good time for me to make that
          script "Making Amends."

          TERRY
          Do you really think people want to
          see you make a movie about a guy
          who goes to AA but isn't really an
          alcoholic? He just needs the
          companionship? That's a pretty big
          left turn.

          GEORGE
          I got money. I want to challenge
          myself. You said you liked it.

          

          

          

          

          74.

          TERRY
          You know, I read it four years ago.
          I need to read it again. I don't
          remember not liking it. I just
          can't tell you the studio will make
          it. Your last few movies didn't do
          so well.

          GEORGE
          I thought they did well overseas.

          TERRY
          You always do well in Australia,
          but that's about it.

          GEORGE
          What if I do it for no money, just
          with back-end?

          TERRY
          I don't know if that's going to cut
          it either. The head of the studio
          does a lot of drinking, I don't
          think he finds that whole area
          funny. Maybe if you commit to do
          another one of the Davey movies, I
          could tie it to that, so they have
          to do both.

          GEORGE
          I'vedone four Davey movies.They
          wantme to do another sequelto
          that?We don't even have ascript.

          TERRY
          Wellthere's this great script
          goingaround town, Happy Holidays.
          Whichis about an immature 40 year
          old man who acts like a kid. In it
          he comes home for the holiday
          season for the first time in ten
          years. And havoc ensues. You get
          to make fun of Thanksgiving, and
          Hanukkah and Christmas and New
          Years. They say they can turn it
          into a Davey movie.

          GEORGE
          Could I at least shoot the Making
          Amends movie first?

          TERRY
          No.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          GEORGE
          Maybe I'll just write something
          myself.

          TERRY
          I wish you would. You've never
          been able to do it in the past.
          You always talk a big game about
          writing your own shit. But I've
          yet to see a script land on my
          desk.

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DUSK

          George and Ira are sitting at a large kitchen table. There
          is a computer on the table and index cards. On the floor is
          a corkboard.

          IRA
          See, the thing I was thinking,
          was...you always play an immature
          guy. What if the joke of the movie
          is you're incredibly smart,
          intellectual and well-mannered.
          You just go the opposite way with
          it.

          GEORGE
          There's nothing funny about being
          smart. All comedy comes from
          immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry
          Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC
          Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin,
          Charlie Chaplin. They were all
          immature. They were all
          knuckleheads. Who wants to see a
          smart guy live his life normally?
          What's funny about that? What else
          you got?

          IRA
          I. .I gotta go through my notes.

          GEORGE
          I'm thinking about taking a gig,
          and having a solid hit before
          getting into breaking new ground.

          IRA
          Well we'll still write the script,
          right?

          

          

          

          

          76,

          GEORGE
          Yeah, if we can come up with an
          idea.

          IRA
          Let's just keep banging at it.

          GEORGE
          I can't. I've got a date.

          IRA
          You have a date? Who do you have a
          date with?

          GEORGE
          This woman my agent set me up with.
          She raises money for this
          environmental group. I guess she's
          like a normal person. I can't live
          here alone in this house forever.
          I need something of significance in
          my life. So I'm gonna go out on
          some dates. No pressure.

          IRA
          You know what you should do, just
          as an experiment? You should try
          and not fuck her?

          GEORGE
          Why would you say that?

          IRA
          Because you're always saying you
          don't know if women like you for
          who you are. You don't know if
          they like you because you have
          money or you're famous. Why not
          take some time and get to know them
          before ass-raping them. In a
          romantic way.

          GEORGE
          That's insulting. Don't take out
          your frustrations on me because you
          can't get laid by acting like I'm
          some sort of deviant. I'm an
          adult. I have adult sexual
          relationships. No one does what
          they don't want to do. Sex is how
          people decide if they like each
          other. I'm testing my
          compatibility by ass-raping them.

          

          

          

          

          77.

          IRA
          See, you can't do it. You can't
          even entertain the idea of getting
          to know somebody for a month before
          sleeping with them.

          GEORGE
          That's not true. I'm bored of sex,
          anyway. There is literally no body-
          part/orifice combination I haven't
          experimented with. There is
          nothing left to do. There is no
          nationalities I haven't.slept with,
          no age groups I haven't slept with.
          I'm fully ready for normal.

          IRA
          What nationalities have you slept
          with?

          GEORGE
          US. Canada. Mexico. England.
          France. Spain. North Korea. Burma.
          Rwanda. Kenya. Tibet. Serbia.
          Chechnya. Iran. The Green Zone.
          Darfur. The Killing Fields of
          Cambodia. Mongolia. What about
          you?

          IRA
          New Jersey. Do handjobs count?
          Because then also California.

          INT. RESTAURTANT - NIGHT

          George is talking with RACHEL WARWICK.

          GEORGE
          You know, I haven't been out on a
          blind date, ever. This may be the
          first one.

          RACHEL
          Oh I go out on them all the time.
          I've been on a bunch of J Dates.

          GEORGE
          What's J Date?

          RACHEL
          It's a website where Jewish people
          find each other.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          GEORGE
          So it's just a list of all the
          Jewish people? I thought we didn't
          liked to be tracked and monitored
          like that.
          She looks at him, doesn't get the joke.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          You know, because of
          the... holocaust.

          RACHEL
          (not understanding)
          It's just a great way for like-
          minded people to meet.

          GEORGE
          What if you don't like Jews?
          She just stares at him.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I'm joking.
          (a beat)
          So, uh, I hear you raise uh money
          for an environmental group. That
          must be very satisfying.

          RACHEL
          It is, because, fixing the
          environment is really about having
          enough of a war chest to sue local
          government and corporations so
          they're forced to observe the
          environmental statutes that are
          already on the books. We also try
          to put pressure on the government
          to put pressure on other countries
          to clean up their environmental
          act. You know, one dilapidated
          factory in China can produce more
          pollution than every car in America
          puts out in one year.

          GEORGE
          See? That's why I still drive a
          big truck. I stop driving that
          truck and that factory shuts down.

          RACHEL
          (not smiling)
          I know you're joking, but it's a
          very serious situation. People
          like you do a lot of damage to the
          environment. Whether it's taking a
          private jet by yourself, or getting
          driven around town limos around
          town or living in your gas-guzzling
          houses. Your carbon footprint is
          huge.

          GEORGE
          You know what they say about people
          with a big carbon footprint? Big
          dick.

          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          George comes in and wakes Ira up.

          GEORGE
          Come on. We're gonna go do a gig
          tonight. Up north. And you're
          gonna open up for me.

          IRA
          How big a theater?

          GEORGE
          I think two thousand.

          IRA
          You should have told me so I could
          have prepared. I've never played a
          place that big. How long do you
          want me to do?

          GEORGE
          Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can
          get there.

          IRA
          Shit.

          GEORGE
          Dress nice. Tickets are expensive.

          IRA
          I don't own anything nice.

          

          

          

          

          80.

          INT. CAR - DAY


           THE
           Ira is driving George's Mercedes. George sits in
           player.
          backseat watching "Cloverfield" on a built-in DVD
          We see images of different parts of California.

          IRA
          How fucking up north is this?

          GEORGE
          Its near San Francisco.

          IRA
          So we have like five more hours to
          drive?

          GEORGE
          It's not that far. It's like two
          more movies.

          IRA
          I don't like how you made me your
          limo driver. It's weird you're in
          the back and I'm up here.

          GEORGE
          I'd sit up front but the DVD player
          is back here.

          IRA
          I can't even listen to the radio
          because you're watching the movie.
          Can I sit back there and you drive?

          GEORGE
          No. I'm near-sighted. I'll miss
          the exit.
          We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Holy shit!

          IRA
          What happened?

          GEORGE
          The monster showed himself.

          IRA

          (SARCASTIC)
          Great.

          EXT. THEATER - DUSK

          The car pulls up to the theater.

          INT. THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

          One of the MANAGERS walks George and Ira through the back of
          the theater toward the dressing room. They walk across the
          stage and we see the empty 2,000 seat theater. Ira is freaked
          out.

          INT. DRESSING ROOM

          George and Ira are sitting in the dressing room, nibbling
          from the fruit tray. There's a knock at the door. A
          Security Person escorts Laura into the dressing room. Ira is
          thrown.

          GEORGE
          Hey, you made it.

          LAURA
          I wouldn't have missed it for the
          world, thanks for inviting me.

          GEORGE
          You remember Ira.

          LAURA
          Hi Ira. Are you performing
          tonight?

          IRA
          I'm afraid so. I've been told if
          I'm good it warms the crowd, and if
          I'm bad it makes them want George
          more, so...

          LAURA
          You look great. How are you
          feeling?

          GEORGE
          I'm hanging in there.

          

          

          

          

          82.

          LAURA
          I thought a lot about you after I
          left.

          GEORGE
          Me too.

          LAURA
          Well the show is going to start in
          a minute, I better get to my seat.
          I just wanted to say hi. Don't be
          too dirty tonight, you know that
          makes me uncomfortable.

          GEORGE
          Now I have no jokes. Ira, you have
          to do an hour and half.
          She laughs.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Come by after and give me the
          review.

          LAURA
          Okay. Break a leg.
          She exits.

          IRA
          You didn't tell her that you're not
          sick anymore? Why wouldn't you
          tell her?

          GEORGE
          I need you to do something for me.
          After your set I gave you a seat
          right next to her. During the
          intermission I want yQ.u to tell her
          I'm not sick anymore.

          IRA
          Me? Why do you want me to tell
          her?

          GEORGE
          Because it's weird, and emotional.
          I think she'll handle it better if
          it comes from somebody else. And
          then I can talk to her about it
          afterwards.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          IRA
          That's weird.

          GEORGE
          She'll be happy. It's not weird.
          You're the bearer of good news.

          IRA
          You had to do this to me right
          before my set. Like I'm not
          nervous enough.

          CUT TO:

          INT. THEATER

          Ira is performing on stage, doing his set. He's doing really
          well. This theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being
          there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his
          jokes. As he continues his set, he gets more confident and,
          for the first time in the film, we think he has the potential
          to be a strong comic.

          INT. THEATER - INTERMISSION

           Laura is sitting in her seat by herself. Ira makes his way
          across the aisle and sits down next to her.

          LAURA
          Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so
          good.

          IRA
          You seem surprised.

          LAURA
          I don't know, you seemed so
          nervous. But you were really solid
          all the way though, and your ending
          hunk really murdered.

          IRA
          Thank you. Hopefully George won't
          be mad if I tired the audience out.

          LAURA
          I don't think he has anything to
          worry about. They always go crazy
          for him. Before he got famous, he
          used to bomb all the time.

          84.

          LAURA (CONT'D)
          And that's when I think he was the
          funniest. And now that everyone
          knows him, it's a little too easy
          for him, I think. No one was
          funnier when the audience hated him
          than George. He loved it.

          IRA
          So you guys were dating right when
          he started doing well?

          LAURA
          Yeah. But you always knew he was
          gonna do well. He had so much
          charisma. He would walk into a
          room and in ten minutes that whole
          room would be about him. Even
          before anyone knew who he was.

          IRA
          Where did you meet him?

          LAURA
          I was the hat-check girl at the
          Improv. And I was acting. I used
          to do guest spots on all those
          shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly
          Hills 90210. I always played the
          bitch. I don't know why, but I was
          on the top of the bitch list.

          IRA
          You don't seem like a bitch.

          LAURA
          That's because I was acting.

          IRA
          Sounds like fun days.

          LAURA
          It was, for awhile.
          Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from
          a distance.

          IRA
          I don't know if you've heard, but
          it looks like George's medicine is
          working.

          LAURA
          What do you mean?

          

          

          

          

          85.

          IPA
          When George got sick they didn't
          think they had any medicine that
          would help, so they put him on
          experimental medicine. And the
          last time he went to the doctor
          they couldn't detect his blood
          disease. They think it might be
          gone.
          A moment as Laura takes this in.

          LAURA
          Why didn't George tell me?

          IRA
          He just found out. He doesn't want
          to jinx it. He doesn't want people
          to get excited, and then have it
          come back again.
          The lights go down.

          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          Ladies and Gentlemen. Here's the
          man you came to see. George
          Simmons.
          The place EXPLODES.

          IRA

          (JOKING)
          I thought everyone came to see me.
          George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look
          more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show
          for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of
          events.
          The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more
          positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being
          sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious,
          and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him
          look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you
          could trust and spend your life with.

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW

          Laura is talking to George and Ira.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          LAURA
          I really don't know what to say.
          It's not like you weren't good
          before, but your act is so much
          more sophisticated, but just as
          funny. I've never seen you speak
          so honestly on stage before. You
          used to say these goofy jokes. It
          was really something, you know, and
          you should be really proud of
          yourself.

          GEORGE
          Thanks. A lot has happened. And
          at least I got some good jokes out
          of it.

          LAURA
          Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm
          really glad I came.

          GEORGE
          Ira and I are driving out of town
          tomorrow, I thought maybe we could
          stop by your place on our way out.
          I want to see what the ranch looks
          like, and meet your husband.

          LAURA
          My husband is actually in China for
          another week, or so. He spends a
          lot of time there helping American
          businesses break into that market.
          So you won't meet him this time,
          but it would be great if you came
          by. That would be fun. I'll give
          you the tour.

          GEORGE
          Okay. We'll come by in the
          morning.

          LAURA
          Okay.
          An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs
          George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have
          equal weight.

          LAURA (CONT'D)
          Bye. I'll see you then.
          She looks at Ira. As she exits--

          

          

          

          

          87.

          LAURA (CONT'D)
          You were good too.

          IRA
          Why do we have to stop by there
          tomorrow? The drive is long enough
          as it is.
          George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars.

          GEORGE
          Here's your money for tonight.
          Good job.

          IRA
          I'm excited to see her ranch. I
          hear it's delightful.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Ira and George are in a room that has two queen-sized beds.
          They each lay on their bed in the dark.

          IRA
          Why couldn't we have gotten two
          different rooms?

          GEORGE
          What's the fun in that? You can go
          pay for your own room, I don't
          care.

          IRA
          So, what happened with you and
          Laura? You seem to get along so
          well. Why did you cheat on her?

          GEORGE
          I was young, stupid... and I liked
          fucking girls. Why do you think I
          cheated? You would do it too if
          anyone would fuck you.

          IRA
          How many times did you cheat on
          her?

          GEORGE
          Two or three times ...a week ...for a
          couple of years.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          IRA
          Jesus.

          GEORGE
          It was awful. There was even
          marriage talk. My parents didn't
          want me to do it because she wasn't
          Jewish. She was taking classes to
          convert, even. I mean, how cool is
          that? She was changing religions
          to be with me. She knew more about
          being a Jew than I did from those
          classes. She was so cute when she
          spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong.
          George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          And then one day, somebody told
          her, I don't know who. And that was
          that.

          IRA
          Why do you want to go see her
          tomorrow? We could do something
          productive like get some writing
          done.

          GEORGE
          I like her. I love her. I miss
          her. I just want to spend a little
          time with her. I know nothing will
          come of it. I just miss being
          around her.
          A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult
          movies.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Anything looking good to you?

          IRA
          I don't want to watch adult movies
          with you.

          GEORGE
          okay. You want to watch Juno?

          IRA
          Okay.

          

          

          

          

          89.
          Juno begins playing.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - DAY

          George and Ira drive up to the house. It's a large one-story
          house that is part of a ranch with a lot of land and a horse
          stable.
          They walk to the front door, ring the doorbell. George seems;
          a little nervous.

          IRA
          You okay, buddy?

          GEORGE
          Yeah, of course I am.
          Laura opens the door.

          LAURA
          Hi? We've been waiting for you.
          Come on in.

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - CONTINUOUS


          GEORGE
          This place is beautiful.

          LAURA
          Thanks. We've been here for five
          years. I think I just finished
          decorating it.
          She leads them through the living room into a huge open
          kitchen. On the island, there is freshly squeezed lemonade,
          chips and dip. She has over-prepared for their arrival.

          IRA
          Can I live here?

          LAURA
          of course, you can clean the
          stables.

          GEORGE
          You have horses?

          

          

          

          

          90.

          LAURA
          Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a
          real city boy. But for some reason
          he loves horses. Of course I'm
          lef t to take care of them. But
          yes, we have three horses.

          IRA
          That's crazy, owning a horse. I
          can't even keep a goldfish alive.

          GEORGE
          All right, well, we're ready for
          the big tour. I want to see how
          you live.
          Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter INGRID runs into the
          room and she's pissed.

          INGRID
          Mom! You said you were coming
          back! We're playing American Idol,
          you're ruining the game!
          Ira is shocked to see that Laura has a child. This
          complicates a situation he already thought was getting too
          complicated.

          LAURA
          I'll come right up. This is my
          friend, George. And Ira.

          INGRID
          It's my turn to sing and you're
          supposed to be the judge and you're
          not in there and I'm very angry!

          IRA
          How old are you?

          INGRID
          Five. But I turn six very soon.

          IRA
          Really? Because I thought you were
          like nine, about to turn ten.

          GEORGE
          She's very pretty.
          (to Ingrid)
          I like your hair.

          

          

          

          

          INGRID
          I'm so sick of people telling me
          they like my hair.
          George is clearly not that good with kids.

          GEORGE
          Okay. I do not like your hair.

          INGRID
          Don't make fun of me.

          LAURA
          He's just joking Ingrid.

          IRA
          My hair. I have curly hair too.
          Curly hair is the best.

          INGRID
          Last week my mom straightened it
          and it almost went to the floor.

          IRA
          If you straighten my hair, I look
          crazy. I look like the killer from
          No Country for Old Men. Have you
          seen that movie?
          MABLE, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.

          MABLE
          You guys left me all alone in the
          playroom! If you're gonna leave
          I'm just gonna go talk on the
          webcam with Caroline.

          LAURA
          Don't be rude. This is Ira and
          George.

          MABLE
          Oh, I know you. My mom watches
          your movies all the time. But most
          of them I'm not allowed to see.
          George smiles at Ira--Laura's a little busted.

          GEORGE
          Oh, really? Do you like them?
          Which one's your favorite?

          

          

          

          

          92.

          MABLE
          I don't know. I don't really like
          the ones I'm allowed to see, but I
          think I would like the ones I'm not
          allowed to see. But she says I
          cant' see them till I'm sixteen.

          GEORGE
          Sixteen? Just fast-forward past
          the bad parts.

          LAURA
          The whole thing is a bad part.
          George LAUGHS in a slightly flirty fashion with Laura. Ira is
          getting uncomfortable with the subtext.

          LAURA (CONT' D )
          C'mon, let's finish the game.

          INT. PLAYROOM

          George, Ira, Laura, and Mable are sitting on the floor.
          Ingrid stands on a make-shift stage singing a Miley Cyrus
          song while wearing a feather boa and sunglasses and a red
          wig.

          INGRID

          (SINGS)
          You've got the best of both worlds.
          Rock it out take it slow. And then
          you rock out the show!
          Everyone applauds for her.

          LAURA
          Okay. Now it's time to see what
          the judges say. I thought you had
          a lot of energy, you're clearly
          gonna make it to the final four,
          and I love your outfit. What do
          you think, Randy?

          IRA
          Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It
          was a little pitchy in places, but
          I dug it. I really dug it.

          MABLE
          .I'm Simon, and I thought it was
          horrible. I don't how you made it
          this far in the competition.

          9 1

          MABLE (CONT'D)
          I think Paula is drunk. You will
          never be American Idol.

          LAURA
          Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to
          your sister. Say something nice.

          MABLE

          (ANNOYED)
          You were good.

          LAURA
          Okay, you're not Simon anymore.
          (to George)
          Simon, what did you think?

          GEORGE
          I can't believe I'm saying this,
          but I agree with Paula. I think
          you're the one to beat.
          They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with
          admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship.

          LAURA
          Okay Mable, you're up.
          Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not
          appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song
          "London Bridge."

          MABLE

          (SINGING)
          I want to go down like London,
          London.

          LAURA
          I told you not to do that. Simon,
          what do you think?

          INGRID
          She was horrible! She's a terrible
          singer! She's inappropriate!

          LAURA
          Okay, who's next? Randy?

          IRA
          I don't know, Dawg. It was a bad
          song choice. I'm not feeling it.

          GEORGE
          My turn. Get ready to be blown
          away.

          

          

          

          

          94.
          George gets up on stage.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)

          (SINGING)
          Take me down to the paradise city.
          Where the grass is green and the
          girls are pretty. Oh, won't you
          please take me home.

          (FASTER)
          Just an urchin livin' under the
          street, I'm a hard case that's
          tough to beat. I'm your charity
          case so buy me somethin' to eat.
          I'll pay you at another time! Take
          it to the end of the line!

          MABLE
          Boo!

          INGRID
          Boo!

          GEORGE
          What? It's Paradise City, by Guns
          and Roses.

          INGRID
          You sound like a girl!

          MABLE
          Vote him off!

          EXT. RANCH - DAY

          Laura sits on a ATV. George sits behind her. Ira is on
          another ATV with Ingrid sitting in front of him, as he
          steers. Mable rides a very small dirt bike.

          LAURA
          All right! Here we go.
          They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of
          the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they
          drive. Ira looks over, concerned.

          INT. BARN - DAY

          Laura shows them their horses, chickens, goats and ducks.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          EXT. RANCH - DAY

          Laura points out a small pond and a fenced-in riding area.
          Laura slows down and allows Ira, Mable and Ingrid to get
          ahead and turn a corner. Then she stops the ATV and turns
          around and kisses George.
          George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him,
          trying to decide what she makes of him now. Then we hear

          O.S.

          MABLE (O.S.)
          Mom! Mom!
          Laura hits the gas and they continue the tour.

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - LATER

          The kids are playing in the background as George, Laura and
          Ira talk.

          GEORGE
          Ira, Laura invited us to stay over
          for dinner.

          IRA
          But it's like a seven, eight hour
          drive home. If we stay for dinner,
          we're not going to get home till
          like four in the morning.
          George stares at Ira for a beat, then --

          GEORGE
          Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
          You have something to do in the
          morning?

          IRA
          No.

          GEORGE
          Then everything will be fine.

          LAURA
          Me and George are gonna go to the
          supermarket and buy some food so I
          can cook dinner. You think you'll
          be okay watching the kids? It'll
          only take forty-five minutes.

          

          

          

          

          96.

          IRA
          Sure. I'm great with kids. I was
          a camp counselor for five years.
          Camp Winadu. Kids love me. I'm
          like a human teddy bear.

          CUT TO:

          INT. LAURA'S SUV - DAY

          Laura is driving through town. George sits in the passenger
          seat.

          GEORGE
          This town is so small and adorable.
          It's like out of a Demi Moore
          movie.

          LAURA
          Clarke's company is about forty-
          five minutes from here. This town
          seemed so perfect when we were
          looking for a house. There's no
          traffic, there's one coffee house,
          one bookstore, one market. No
          crime. But after you've lived her
          a few years you hunger for another
          coffee shop, a bigger bookstore,
          and a little crime. It gets so
          boring. And it's such a small
          town, God forbid you miss one of
          you kid's soccer games, they put
          the scarlet letter on you.

          GEORGE
          it can't be that bad. You live on
          a pretty little ranch. You have
          horses, a duck. It must be a nice
          life.

          LAURA
          We used to have so much fun. I
          don't think I have that much fun
          anymore. I don't like who I'm
          turning into. Is the fun over? I
          have to get up every morning at
          six, drive my kids to school and
          then I have 6 hours before I have
          to pick them up. I have to yell at
          them to do their homework, be a
          taskmaster, then I make them
          dinner.

          97.

           LAURA (CONT'D)
           It takes an hour to shower them and
           put them to bed. And then it's
          8:30 and I pass out. And it's
           great, but tuck. And when both
           kids are done with high school I'll
          be 49 years old, and then I'll have
           probably 6 very healthy years, then
          I'll kind of slow down and then
          I'll be an old woman. And that was
          it. And it's great, but fuck.

          GEORGE
          I couldn't believe you moved out of
          LA. You were getting some good
          jobs as an actress. You got to
          play the bitch on Melrose Place for
          awhile and make out with Andrew
          Shue. That was pretty good. Do you
          miss it?

          LAURA
          Yes. Being a mom is very
          fulfilling, but there are other
          parts of me and every once in
          awhile I go a little crazy.

          GEORGE
          How do you go crazy?

          LAURA
          I just get bored and depressed.
          And you know how my PMS is kind of
          out of control. This little boy
          hit Ingrid in school, and his mom
          acted like she didn't care at all,
          so I told her to fuck off.
          They both laugh.

          GEORGE
          Oh, that must have gotten ugly.
          How long did that stay awkward for?

          LAURA

          (JOKING)
          Always. That woman hates me. And
          I hate her. And now our kids
          really like each other, so it's
          really fucked up.

          GEORGE
          Maybe you weren't acting on Melrose
          Place.

          

          

          

          

          98.
          She laughs.

          LAURA
          Screw you.

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - DAY

          Ira, Mable and Ingrid are making elaborate paper mache heads.
          As they do it, Ira is leading them in the type of song you
          would sing at camp.

          INT. LAURA'S SUV - DAY


          LAURA
          And my husband cheated on me, said
          he did it once but I know because I
          learned from you, they do it once,
          they do it all the time. You
          either cheat or you don't.

          GEORGE
          well I don't anymore. I haven't
          cheated on anybody since you. I
          haven't even been in a committed
          relationship since you, so it's
          impossible for me to have cheated.

          LAURA
          That's both flattering and deeply
          disturbing.

          GEORGE
          I thought a lot about you when I
          was sick, and I would do anything
          for another chance. I know it
          creates a mess, but I think it
          would be worth it. I think we both
          know it's what we should be doing.
          He kisses her.

          LAURA
          We can't go the supermarket.

          GEORGE
          Why?

          LAURA
          Because people will see us.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          GEORGE
          So? What's wrong with that?

          LAURA
          Well it'll be weird because we're
          about to do something we shouldn't
          do.

          EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - DAY

           Ira, Mable and Ingrid are outside at a table building houses
          out of Popsicle sticks.

          IRA
          If you had an Exacto knife we could
          cut these sticks in half and make a
          chimney.

          MABLE

          (SADLY)
          When is George gonna die?

          INGRID
          George is gonna die?

          IRA
          Why would you say that?

          MABLE
          I heard my mom talking to her
          friend about it on the phone and
          crying.

          INGRID
          I don't want George to die.

          MABLE
          What do you care? You just met
          him.

          IRA
          George is gonna be fine.

          MABLE
          They told me my grandfather
          wouldn't die, but he did.

          IRA
          Here's the truth. George was
          really sick.

          IRA (CONT'D)
          But he went to the doctor and they
          found the right medicine and now
          he's better. And he's gonna live a
          long time.
          The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved.

          MABLE
          I think my mom's in love with him.
          Ira looks doubly disturbed. He quickly goes back to his
          popsicle sticks.

          EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - GUEST HOUSE

          George and Laura park in the driveway, then sneak around to a
          back guest house.

          INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

          George and Laura enter the guest house, which has been turned
          into her husband's office/playroom/sports-viewing room. On
          the wall are six enormous flatscreen TVs. The room is also
          filled with sports memorabilia in Lucite cases and expensive
          looking sports photography.

          GEORGE
          Does somebody in your family like
          sports?
          They start passionately making out, slamming into the
          flatscreens.

          LAURA
          I really never thought I was going
          to see you again. I grieved for
          you like you were dead.
          They continue to kiss. Suddenly she stops.

          LAURA (CONT'D)
          I can't do this.

          GEORGE
          Then let's not do it.
          She stares at him, trying to figure out what he's become-- is
          he a good guy or a bad guy?

          LAURA
          I gotta get back to the kids.

          

          

          

          

          101.
          INT. LAtJRA'S RANCH - ENTRYWAY - DAY
          Laura and George are walking into the house. They are not
          holding any bags. They walk into the living room where Ira
          is making a Spongebob SquarePants puzzle on the floor with
          Mable and Ingrid.

          IRA
          You're back. That was quick.

          GEORGE
          The town is beautiful.

          IRA
          Where are the groceries?

          LAURA
          We decided ordering in might be a
          little more fun.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          Everyone is sitting on the couch watching Ratatouille on the
          television. They see car lights in the driveway.

          LAURA
          Food's here! All right, everybody.
          Let's sit down at the kitchen
          table.
          Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens
          the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A handsome
          man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It's
          CLARKS, Laura's husband.

          LAURA (CONT'D)
          Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you
          doing home?

          CLARKE
          The man I was supposed to have a
          meeting with had a heart attack, if
          you can believe that. So I decided
          to try and sneak home for a few
          days before my next set of
          meetings.
          George appears behind Laura, not knowing what he's getting
          himself into.

          

          

          

          

          102.

          GEORGE
          Oh. Hello.

          CLARKE
          Hello.

          LAURA
          Oh, Clarke. George had a
          performance last night in town,
          which I went to, and him and his
          opening act, Ira, came by to say
          hello on their way out of town.
          There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives
          George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man
          you think is dying.

          CLARKE
          It is really nice to meet you,
          George. Laura talks about you all
          the time, and we're obviously big
          fans of your movies.

          GEORGE
          Well, thank you. You've got a
          great family and a great home.

          LAURA
          I'm so glad you're home, honey.
          Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over.

          IRA
          What's taking so long with the
          pizza?
          Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears
          in the doorway.

          PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
          Hi. That'll be twenty-eight forty-
          seven, please.

          INT. KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING

          Everyone is seated for dinner, including the kids.

          IRA

          (NERVOUSLY)
          This is really great pizza. Thank
          you very much.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          103.

          IRA (CCNT'D)
          It tastes just like New York pizza,
          which is so surprising because you
          can't get good pizza in Los
          Angeles, so you wouldn't think you
          could get it in Northern
          California. But this really tastes
          like New York pizza.
          A long pause.

          GEORGE
          Sounds like your business is going
          very well.

          CLARKE
          People never thought China would do
          this much business with us, you
          know, but it didn't seem like a
          risky proposition for me. They've
          got a billion people, we make all
          kinds of cool shit in America,
          they start finding out about it on
          the internet and what-not. Sooner
          or later they're gonna find a way
          to get our shit.

          LAURA
          He speaks Chinese. For real.
          Ingrid yells at something in Chinese.

          CLARKE
          You don't think they want new
          mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm
          trying to get access into North
          Korea, no shit. That situation
          could chance overnight. That is a
          huge market waiting to be tapped.
          It's already starting in Cuba.

          IRA
          My friend backpacked across China
          and he caught some sort of virus or
          something from what he ate. He was
          sickforweeks. He still has it.
          It'sthekind of thing you can't
          getridof, you have it for the
          restofyour life, but it stays
          dormant.

          CLARKE
          So, George. How are you holding
          up?

          

          

          

          

          104.

          GEORGE
          Uh...I'm hanging in there.

          CLARKE
          How are you feeling?

          LAURA
          He's doing really well. He's been
          very strong.

          CLARKE
          It's a terrible situation. I'm so
          sorry.

          GEORGE
          I appreciate that.

          LAURA
          He's been fighting the good fight.
          His doctors are taking very good
          care of him.
          Ira can believe this conversation is happening.

          CLARKE
          You're a tougher man than me. I
          don't know how I could go about my
          day with that hanging over my head.

          GEORGE
          It just makes you appreciate every
          moment. It brings things into
          focus, you suddenly realize what's
          important in life.

          LAURA
          Does anybody want seconds? Or
          should I bring out the desert?

          IRA
          I'd love desert. What do you have?
          Do you have any ice cream or cake,
          or anything like that? I have a
          real big sweet tooth right now.
          Why don't we go into the kitchen
          and do an ice cream bar with kids
          right now? I've got a better idea,
          I make a really good milkshake. We
          should all go make milkshakes with
          the kids right now in the kitchen.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          TNT. LIVING ROOM
          Empty milkshakes litter the coffee table.

          CLARKE
          Do you know who might be able to
          help you? A Chinese doctor. Have
          you explored Eastern medicine at
          all?

          LAURA
          Now's not the time to talk about
          this.

          CLARKE
          I'm trying to help the man.

          GEORGE
          No, I haven't.

          CLARKE
          Hey. I'm the last guy who would
          buy into that shit, but it works.

          LAURA
          He really is the last guy who would
          buy into that shit.

          CLARKE
          Our country's only two hundred
          years old. The Chinese have been
          around for thousand of years
          figuring this shit out. How I got
          into it, I had acid ref lux and
          nothing was working and then this
          guy at work turned me onto a
          Chinese doctor and he gave me some
          herbs that tasted like dogshit, but
          they worked.

          LAURA

          (NERVOUSLY)
          I take herbs for my PMS. They
          really helped.

          MABLE
          Daddy, you've been cursing a lot.
          You owe me a dollar for every
          curse. I think you owe me fifty
          dollars.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          INGRID
          This conversation is scaring me. I
          don't want George to die.

          CLARKE
          You girls can go play in the other
          room. The Chinese have a completely
          different way of looking at health.
          They don't think doctors should
          attack the diseases in the body,
          they're all about trying to support
          the body and make it stronger, so
          the body can fight off the disease.
          It works. I've seen it. I wish I
          could find a way to mass-market
          Chinese medicine in this country.
          Someone's gonna do it and make a
          fuck-load of money. Because these
          people get old, really old. You
          can't kill these people.

          IRA
          Either that or they're all young
          and they just look like shit.
          Clarke laughs.

          CLARKE
          This guy's funny. You should be
          opening up for this guy. Hey, who
          wants a drink?

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          Everyone is taking a walk around the ranch. It is very
          pretty outside.

          CLARKE
          I'm going to retire in seven years.
          I'm done. I'm playing golf for the
          next fifty years. Work hard now,
          then get out. That's my plan. I'm
          putting in the time. Then I'm
          getting the fuck out. I don't like
          working. I will do it. I like
          what it gets me. But I don't like
          it.

          GEORGE
          You ever see Laura act? She was
          quite an actress in her day.

          

          

          

          

          107.

          LAURA
          George, stop.

          CLARKE
          That's what I hear. Can't say I
          watched that much 'Melrose Place'
          back in the day. She keeps telling
          me to watch the videos but, you
          know, I was never a big 'Party of
          Five' fan.

          LAURA
          Well, I also ran a theatre company.
          And it was down to me and Cameron
          Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed
          a lot for our family.

          CLARKE
          Okay, if you say so.
          (a beat)
          The Mask was a funny fucking movie.
          You know what other movie Cameron
          Diaz was great in? 'There's
          Something About Mary.'
          Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and
          disrespect. They keep walking.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          I love walking it off after a big
          meal.

          GEORGE
          It's beautiful here at night.

          LAURA
          There's no pollution here like in
          LA so you can actually see the
          stars.

          IRA
          They are beautiful, but we have to
          get going. We have a really long
          drive to get back to Los Angeles.

          CLARKE
          You can't leave now, you won't get
          back until daylight. You should
          crash in the guest house. I'm sure
          it not as fancy pants as where you
          live, George, but it's better than
          driving all night or crashing at a
          hotel.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          108.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          And if you want to hang out
          tomorrow I just installed six
          flatscreens, we can watch all the
          football games we want. And dog-
          racing from Florida. There's a big
          game tomorrow. Ira, you must have
          played some ball in your day.

          IRA
          No, I'm just big-boned.

          GEORGE
          We probably should get some rest
          before the drive. All right, show
          us to our quarters, sir.

          INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

          George sleeps on the bed. Ira sleeps on a couch across the
          room. The door slowly opens, Laura enters wearing a bathrobe.
          She walks to the bed and quietly slips under the covers,
          removing her bathrobe in the process. Without ever speaking,
          she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make
          love to him. George is surprised but not completely shocked
          and goes along happily with it.
          ANGLE ON: Ira, he never wakes up.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING


          CLARKE
          You sure you can't stay?

          IRA
          We really do need to get back. I
          have to visit my mom. I can't miss
          it. It's her birthday. Everyone
          in my family is coming in from
          across the country for it. She's
          turning 65. It's very important we
          get back for it.

          LAURA
          That's too bad, I wish you could
          stay.

          CLARKE
          (very serious)
          I wish I could say I was gonna see
          you again, but I can't say that.
          His eyes start to mist up.

          

          

          

          

          109.

          LAURA
          Clarke, don't. You don't need to
          do that.

          CLARKE
          You know what? I think I do need
          to do that. One thing I learned in
          China from some Buddhist friends of
          mine is it's important to have an
          open heart, to live in the moment,
          and to speak the truth to each
          other. So I'd like to say to you,
          George, that it was a great
          pleasure to meet someone who had
          such a big impact on my wife's
          life. I really like you. And wish
          we had more time to get to know
          each other. And I wish you a
          peaceful end to your journey. And
          another great journey on the other
          side of it.
          Clarke hugs George.

          GEORGE
          I really don't know what to say. I
          re- ally don't know what to say.

          LAURA
          That was beautiful, honey. Well
          let me walk them to the car.
          Ingrid walks over.

          INGRID
          Don't be sad. Ira told us that his
          medicine is working and he's not
          sick anymore.

          MABLE
          I think that was a secret. I don't
          think you were supposed to say
          that.

          CLARKE
          Mable, take Ingrid into the house.

          MABLE
          Can we watch another SpongeBob
          movie? Atlantis.Squarepantis?

          

          

          

          

          110.

          CLARKE
          Yes. Go into the house and watch a
          movie now!
          Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          What the fuck is going on around
          here?
          (to Laura)
          Is that true?

          LAURA
          I never said that he was still
          sick. He just took some medicine
          and it's looking better. You can't
          detect it in his blood, but it
          could come back.

          CLARKE
          Is it looking better? Or is he
          better?
          (to Ira)
          Is he sick anymore?

          IRA
          Well ...I don't how you define these
          things-I'm not... sure.

          CLARKE
          is something going on here? Are
          you getting your revenge on me
          while I'm away? I came clean with
          you, you can't come clean with me.

          LAURA
          You know what? I don't know what I
          want now.

          IRA
          Oh shit.
          It's ON.

          CLARKE
          So this is what you want? Was he
          ever sick in the first place?

          IRA
          He was sick. He was very sick.

          

          

          

          

          CLARKE
          Because if this is what you want,
          I'll leave right now. I'm not
          going to play these games. I'm
          happy to leave. I'm not gonnna
          have you put me on the cross
          because I made some mistakes. You
          guys enjoy each other. I could
          give a fuck. If you need me, I'll
          be at my apartment in China.
          Clarke leaves.

          INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mable and Ingrid are asleep.

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Laura is alone in her room, crying. (she might be on the
          phone, talking honestly with a friend.)

          INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

          George lays on the bed. Ira is pacing around the room.

          IRA
          What the fuck is going on? Did you
          guys do something?

          GEORGE
          We had sex in Clarke's office.

          IRA
          Why?

          GEORGE
          Because I love her. She's the best
          thing that's ever happened to me.

          IRA
          But she has two kids, she's
          married.

          GEORGE
          She's miserable. He cheated on
          her.

          IRA
          You cheated on her.

          

          

          

          

          112.

          GEORGE
          Yeah, but that was a long time ago.
          I've changed. You saw that douche
          bag. You don't think he's fucking
          geishas on every business trip?

          IRA
          He was trying to cure you with
          herbs. He seems like a great guy.

          GEORGE
          This is none of your fucking
          business. Just stay out of it.

          IRA
          I can't stay out of it. We took
          your car here. I have no way of
          leaving.

          GEORGE
          This shit is deeper than you
          understand. People get divorced.
          People make mistakes and then they
          fix them. That's how life works.
          It's not a big deal. I know you're
          still sad because your parents got
          divorced. Well get the fuck over
          it. Call a fucking cab and go
          home.

          IRA
          So what are we gonna do?

          GEORGE
          You're gonna sleep in Clarke's
          office. I'm gonna go talk to
          Laura.

          INT. LAURA'S STUDY - LATER

          George walks into the room, discovers Laura on the computer,
          going through papers. She is smoking a joint.

          GEORGE
          On, there you are. I've been
          looking for you.

          LAURA
          I've been going through all the
          bank statements, trying to figure
          out which are in his name and which
          are in mine.

          113

          LAURA (CONT-C)
          Almost all the accounts are in his
          name. I wonder if he did that on
          purpose.

          GEORGE
          Are you smoking a joint?

          LAURA
          Yeah. My best friend Nancy grows
          this stuff on a hill by her house.
          You want some?

          GEORGE
          No, that stuff makes me paranoid.

          LAURA
          Not me. It makes me feel sharper,
          Some people get tired, I get more
          energy, more clear.

          GEORGE
          What's happening?

          LAURA
          What's happening? Whatever we want
          to happen is gonna happen now. I'm
          free. I'm fucking free.
          Laura gets up, kisses him.

          LAURA (CONT'D)
          We're free.

          GEORGE

          (NERVOUSLY)
          Yeah, we're free.
          They start kissing again. She starts to moan loudly.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Not so loud, your kids are
          sleeping.

          LAURA
          A tank could roll through this
          place, it wouldn't wake them up.
          They kiss some more. She moans louder.

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - GUEST ROOM

          Ira calls Daisy on the phone, in a panic about what is
          happening.

          

          

          

          

          114.

          DAISY (V.0.)
          Hello?

          IRA
          (on phone)
          Hey, Daisy. It's Ira.

          DAISY (V.0.)
          Oh. Ira. What's going on?

          IRA
          I just wanted to talk to you
          because I'm in the middle of a
          terrible situation and I don't have
          anyone I can talk about it with.
          My friends are all mad at me and
          George is kind of losing his mind.

          DAISY (V.0.)
          You can tell me, what is it?

          IRA
          Look, I know you think I have the
          moral code of some guy from the 50s
          like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm
          with George and he's hitting on his
          ex-girlfriend who's married now and
          has kids and I don't know what to
          do. I'm kind of freaking out. I
          think I'm having a panic attack.

          DAISY (V.0.)
          Well don't have a panic attack,
          that's not going to help anything.

          IRA
          Well telling me to not have a panic
          attack is not going to stop it.

          DAISY (V.0.)
          (screaming at the top of
          her lungs)

          DON'T HAVE A PANIC ATTACK!!!

          IRA
          Haha, very funny.

          DAISY (V.0.)
          Seriously, what's going on?

          IRA
          Well I guess they dated like ten
          years ago...

          

          

          

          

          115.
          Ira and Daisy begin to have a bonding conversation.

          MUSIC UP - MUSIC THAT MAKES IT FEEL LIKE A NEW DAY, THE

          BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          Laura, George, Ira, Mable and Ingrid are happily cooking and
          eating breakfast. They look like a happy, strange kid of
          family.

          EXT. RANCH - DAY

          Numerous images of them horse-back riding. Ira looks
          terrified.

          EXT. POND - DAY

          They are all fishing, feeding ducks.

          INT. GROVE - DAY

          They pick lemons out of a tree.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          They are riding ATVs while their dogs chase them.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The kids are climbing a tree. Laura is spotting them.
          George pulls Ira aside.

          GEORGE

          (EXHAUSTED)
          Jesus Christ, what time is it
          already?

          IRA
          It's 10:15 in the morning.

          GEORGE
          Oh my god. Really? I mean, this
          is fun, but I don't know how much I
          can take. Hopefully they'll take a
          nap at some point. I want to take
          a nap.

          

          

          

          

          116.

          IRA
          They don't look that tired.
          The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight
          more hours in them.

          INT. RESTAURTANT - DAY

          George, Laura, Ira, and the kids are seated at a table. The
          kids are coloring with crayons.

          MABLE
          Look what I did. I want this hung
          up on the wall.
          She shows them the picture, which is clearly not appropriate
          for the wall: a picture of herself choking and dying.

          MABLE (CONT'D)
          The food here made me sick.

          INGRID
          Mama, I have to go to the bathroom.
          Come wipe my butt.

          LAURA
          I have to talk to them for a
          minute. Mable, go wipe your
          sister's butt.

          MABLE
          She can do it. She's almost six.
          That's weird.
          Ingrid and Mable walk off together.

          IRA
          I wet the bed til I was eleven. It
          wasn't even a mental thing. I just
          got relaxed when I was asleep.

          LAURA
          I spoke to Clarke. He's going to
          fly back to China tonight. I was
          thinking about driving to the
          airport and meeting him there and
          telling him that when he comes
          back, he should find another place
          to live.

          

          

          

          

          117.

          GEORGE
          That's great. Are you okay doing
          that?

          LAURA
          Yes. It's what I want. I just
          need to figure out when we would
          move down to LA. It might be
          better to let the kids finish out
          the school year because I have to
          apply to the private schools in LA,
          and I don't know if I missed the
          deadline. Then I'd have to look
          into the charter schools.
          Sometimes these private schools, if
          you give them a donation, they let
          your kids in. Maybe you can stay
          up here for part of the year if I
          can't make it happen.

          GEORGE
          Sure. If I'm not shooting a movie,
          or on tour or something, that would
          be great.
          Laura leans in and kisses George. George is not big on
          public displays of affection. He kisses back, but you can
          tell that he's very uncomfortable.
          They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly
          separate.

          MABLE
          I made her wipe her own butt.

          INGRID
          I did it, but I don't know if I did
          a good job.
          (to George)
          Look at what I drew. I drew a
          picture of you. Look? Show Mama.
          George holds it up. It is a picture of several people.

          INGRID (CONT'D)
          That's you. That's George. That's
          Mommy. And Daddy. And me. And
          Mable. That's all of us.
          We see the picture, and it is everybody holding hands.

          

          

          

          

          118.

          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

          George and Ira are walking around a very small bookstore.

          GEORGE
          This is a small bookstore. They've
          only got one Philip Roth book.
          Didn't he write like fifty books?

          IRA
          So when are we going to go home?
          You're not talking at all about
          when we're going to go home.

          GEORGE
          She's going to talk to Clarke
          tonight, and then she's going to
          make a plan. We've got to get over
          that hurdle.

          IRA
          Are you okay with everything? This
          is happening pretty fast.

          GEORGE
          This is exactly what I wanted.

          IRA
          Okay.

          GEORGE
          I mean, she's cool, right?

          IRA
          She's nice. I don't really know
          her very well.

          GEORGE
          She was kind of cooler when I knew
          her back in the day. She's still
          hot, but she was crazy hot back
          then. Her attitude has changed a
          bit. With the kids and all. Back
          then she was really sexy, and all
          about fucking. I know she's busy
          with her life now, but it is a
          little different.

          IRA
          Yeah, well when you have two kids
          and a husband, and horses and
          ducks, it's not all about fucking.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          119,

          IRA (CONT'D)
          That's just the hormones of youth.
          I'm all about fucking. But I don't
          expect to be when I get older.
          I'll be occasionally about fucking,
          which is normal. The fact that
          you're all about fucking now is the
          weird thing.

          GEORGE
          Well hopefully everything will work
          out. If it doesn't, it just wasn't
          meant to be.

          IRA
          What does that mean?

          GEORGE
          It means I'm going to give it a
          shot. I'm excited, but I'm not
          going to really know if it works
          until we're in it. I hope I'm just
          not in love with the person she
          used to be.

          IRA
          She's about to leave her husband
          for good. She has two kids.
          You're not sure this is going to
          work?

          GEORGE
          There's no way to ever be sure that
          anything's going to work! I
          couldn't live up here. She wants
          me to live up here. I don't think
          I can do it. Maybe a couple of
          weeks a year.

          IRA
          Well, she'll live with you.

          GEORGE
          Do you think she means that she's
          going to bring the kids too?

          IRA
          Of course. What else would she do?

          GEORGE
          I don't know, don't some men get
          custody of the kids? Or they split
          the custody? I like the kids, but
          I've never lived with kids before.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          120.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          The young one's kind of cute, but I
          don't think I can stand the old one
          full time. There's too much going
          on there. But I could definitely
          tolerate the young one. She's
          cute. Maybe they can split kids.
          Maybe Clarke will take the annoying
          one.
          Ira just stares at him, not sure what to do.

          EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT

          George kisses Laura, and then she gets in her car.

          LAURA
          I'll be back in an hour and a half,
          tops. And then it all begins.

          GEORGE
          Okay, call me if you need any
          backup.

          LAURA
          I love you.

          GEORGE
           (really uncomfortable)
          I.. . love you.
          The car drives off.

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT

          Ira is on the floor with the kids. He watches the headlights
          of Laura's car disappear down the driveway.
          George walks back into the room.

          GEORGE
          Okay, I'm going to go into the
          other room and watch some TV.

          IRA
          You don't want to hang with the
          kids?

          GEORGE
          Nah, I was going to watch four
          hockey games at once. I've never
          done that.

          

          

          

          

          121.

          IRA
          okay, but I've got to run out and
          grab some cigarettes.

          GEORGE
          But you don't smoke.

          IRA
          I never smoked in front of you
          because you were sick. But I do.

          INT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT

          Ira drives in a panic.

          IRA
          Holy shit, holy shit. Where's the
          fucking airport around here?
          Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in
          a panic. He can't make it work.

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT

          George is watching the kids. He is not good with them, so it
          is very weird.

          INGRID (O.S.)
          George! Help!
          George jumps up and runs to her. She is in the bathroom
          sitting on the toilet.

          INGRID (CONT'D)
          Can you wipe my butt?

          GEORGE
          Don't you know how to do it?

          INGRID
          I don't do it good.

          GEORGE

          (RELUCTANTLY)
          Okay.

          INT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT

          Ira is still messing with the navigation system. He finally
          gets frustrated and punches it.

          

          

          

          

          12-) .
          Ira yells to someone on the street.

          IRA
          How do you get to the fucking
          airport?!

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT

          George calls Ira, gets voice mail.

          GEORGE
          Where are you, where are you? You
          have to come back here. I need
          your help. I don't know how to do
          this.
          He walks back to where the kids are. They are watching tv.
          All around the room are family pictures. He is beginning to
          feel bad about what is happening.

          INT./EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          Laura gets to check-in, looks around. She does not see
          Clarke.

          INT. LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          George is sitting at the kitchen table. Mable walks over.

          MABLE
          I think my mom and dad are getting
          a divorce. I don't want my parents
          to get divorced. All my friends'
          parents are divorced, and they're
          not happy.

          GEORGE
          Why would you say that?

          MABLE
          I heard my mom talking to her
          friend. I listened through the
          wall. She was looking for a lawyer.
          He cheated on her. What does
          cheating mean? That he's going to
          marry someone else? Why don't they
          just try harder?

          

          

          

          

          123.

          INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          Laura looks for Clarke at the news stand.

          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT

          George is on the phone.

          GEORGE
          Laura, it's George. Come back to
          the house. Maybe you shouldn't do
          it. Maybe it's too early for this.
          Call the house.

          INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          Laura walks into the airport lounge. She sees Clarke. She
          looks at him for a moment, then heads over to him with
          determination.

          EXT./INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          Ira parks in the no-standing zone. He gets out and starts
          walking into the airport. His phone rings, he answers. It's
          George.

          GEORGE (V.0.)
          Where are you?

          IRA
          I'm getting cigarettes.

          GEORGE (V.0.)
          You've been gone for forty minutes.

          IRA
          I got lost. I don't know this
          town.

          GEORGE (V.O.)
          Well come back. I don't know how
          to take care of these kids, I'm not
          a camp counselor like you. These
          kids are on to me. The older one's
          too intense. She's troubled.
          She's like Damien, from the Omen.
          I need help.

          

          

          

          

          124.

          IRA
          Ok, I'll hurry back.

          INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          Ira runs around the airport, looking for Laura and Clarke.

          INT. AIRPORT - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Laura is talking to Clarke, emotional. Clarke is crying.

          CLARKS
          I'm so sorry. This only happened
          because of me. It's all my fault.
          I made you feel terrible. I made
          you feel unsafe in our
          relationship. I'm so sorry.
          Please forgive me.
          Ira stands there, staring at them.

          LAURA
          I'm sorry too. I love you so much.
          It was just a flirtation. It never
          went anywhere. It's just after you
          cheated on me, I felt so alone.
          And you were gone so often that I
          felt like our life doesn't work.

          CLARKE
          Then I have to make a change. I'll
          stop most of the traveling.
          There's nothing more important than
          you and the kids.
          Ira starts to turn to sneak away. Clarke sees him.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          Ira! What's going on? What are
          you doing here?

          IRA
          Oh, I'm just headed back to Los
          Angeles. I've got some spots at
          the Improv I've got to do this
          weekend.

          LAURA
          (under her breath)
          Oh, fuck.

          

          

          

          

          12-5.

          CLARKE
          You're headed back to Los Angeles?
          Then why are you at the
          International terminal?

          IRA
          This is the International terminal?
          I'm so confused, I've never been to
          this airport before.

          CLARKE
          Yeah, this is the Air China First
          Class Lounge.
          REVEAL that everyone else in the lounge is Chinese.

           CLARKE (COIN' D )
          What the fuck is going on? What
          the fuck is going on, Laura?

          LAURA
          I don't know what to say.

          CLARKE
          Tel- me the truth ! Just tell me
          the tri.t_h.;_

          LAURA
          I came here to tell you that I
          wanted you to move out when you
          came home. But I realized this was
          a mistake, so I didn't say it.
          Please don't hold that against me.
          We've worked everything out.
          Everything is fine.

          CLARKE
          Who's watching the kids? Who's
          watching the fucking kids?

          IRA
          An adult is watching them.

          CLARKE
          Is George watching our fucking
          kids? I will kill him.
          Clarke runs off.

          IRA
          What the hell happened?

          

          

          

          

          12 6

          LAURA
          Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck
          out of my life! You and George
          have to get the fuck out of my
          life. You are ruining everything!

          IRA
          Uh oh.
          Ira runs out of the lounge. Laura runs out also.

          INT. LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          George with the kids. Oblivious to what is happening.

          EXT. AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

          Ira comes back out, his car is about to be towed.

          IRA
          No, no, no! I'm here. I'm here.

          INT./EXT. CLARKE'S CAR

          Clarke drives home, pissed off.

          INT./EXT. LAURA'S SUV

          Laura drives home, quickly.

          INT. IRA'S CAR

          Ira drives, in a panic, on his cell phone. The phone goes
          through to George's voice mail.

          IRA
          George! Clarke is coming back to
          the house. He knows everything!
          I'm coming to get you. Be at the
          end of the driveway. No! Be at
          the next driveway over! To the
          north!

          EXT./INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT

          Clarke arrives at the house. He sees George sitting with
          the kids.

          

          

          

          

          CLARKE
          (angry-to Mable and

          INGRID)
          Can you take it into the family fun
          room?

          MABLE
          Are you two going to fight?

          CLARKE
          Ye s.

          EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          George and Clarke walk outside. Clarke puts up his fists,
          ready to fight.

          GEORGE
          She's not happy.
          Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts
          style.

          CLARKE
          No one who's married is fucking
          happy. Leave us alone! You fucked
          up. You fucked it up with her a
          long time ago. Let it go or I will
          kill you. I will literally kill
          you till you're fucking dead. That
          disease didn't kill you. But I
          will kill you.

          GEORGE
          You shouldn't joke about my
          disease. That was very serious.
          Very scary.
          Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like
          martial arts hits.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          What the hell is that?
          Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Don't jump in. Whatever you do,
          don't jump in. I don't want your
          help!

          

          

          

          

          128.

          IRA
          Okay.

          GEORGE
          You said you were getting
          cigarettes then you ran to the
          airport to stop her. What kind of
          friend are you?

          IRA
          I am a good friend because this
          entire situation is crazy. You are
          out of control.

          GEORGE
          I didn't deserve what you did to
          me. You betrayed me !

          IRA
          When I got there, she was already
          kissing him. I never even had a
          chance to stop it. I didn't get to
          do anything!

          CLARKE
          Don't pretend you're fucking mad at
          each other, just to distract me so
          I won't beat your ass.
          Clarke pushes George.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          You're gonna come to my house?
          You're gonna come to my fucking
          house? You have to get your own
          life. Leave us the fuck alone.

          GEORGE
          Don't hit me! I've been sick!
          They don't know. The medicine is
          working now, but I'm still sick.
          Clarke punches George.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          (to Ira)
          What are you doing? I said to jump
          in!

          IRA
          You told me not to jump in.

          

          

          

          

          129.

          GEORGE
          That's what "don't jump in" means.
          It means "jump in." Help me!
          Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          You're a terrible fighter.

          IRA
          I know, that's why I became a
          comedian, because everyone used to
          beat me up!
          George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard,
          sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and
          Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet.
          Laura runs into the middle of the scene.

          GEORGE
          Laura, tell Clarke to stop!

          LAURA
          Clarke, please don't do this.

          CLARKE
          Don't tell me what I can and can
          not do.

          GEORGE
          Laura, tell him. Tell him you want
          to be with me now.
          Laura doesn't answer.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Laura?

          LAURA
          Why did you have to come here and
          confuse me? Everything was fine
          before you came here. Now
          everything is all screwed up.

          GEORGE
          Laura, what's it going to be? Are
          you going with him, or are you
          going with me?
          Laura looks at Clarke.

          

          

          

          

          130.

          LAURA
          With him.

          GEORGE
          Don't do this.

          LAURA
          You fucked up my life. And now I
          fucked up yours. But just a
          little. Probably just for a day.
          She walks back into the house.

          CLARKE
          Hit the road before I put you
          through another round.

          GEORGE
          You cheated on her too!

          CLARKE
          Yeah, but we're married. We're
          going to work through this shit.
          You should have waited until you
          were married to cheat. It buys
          you another chance.
          Clarke punches George. Ira is on the ground. He doesn't get
          up.

          GEORGE
          She told me I was the love of her
          life. And she loves me more than
          she loves you!

          CLARKE
          When she said that, did she think
          you were dying?

          GEORGE
          Yeah!

          CLARKE
          Too bad you had to 'Live and find
          out it wasn't true. Leave my
          fucking family alone!
          Clarke punches him. George gets a punch in but it doesn't
          hurt Clarke. Clarke punches him again.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          I can do this all night.

          

          

          

          

          131.
          Clarke hits George again. Ira leaps on Clarke and now all
          three are on the ground rolling around, arms flailing.

          GEORGE
          (to Ira)
          Stop Ira, you're hitting me too.
          Mable and Ingrid appear outside.

          MABLE
          What are you guys doing?

          INGRID
          What's happening?
          The three look at the kids and instantly feel awful.

          IRA
          We're just playing that's all.

          GEORGE
          We're wrestling. It's fun.

          CLARKS
          Boys like to wrestle just like
          girls.
          They all start wrestling some more, but this time it is fake
          playful. They give each other noogies, and tickle each other
          so the kids won't be scared.
          A little blood runs off of George's face.

          INGRID
          Are you bleeding?

          GEORGE
          No. We were just painting. I got
          some paint on my cheek.

          CLARKE
          Come on girls. Let's go inside.
          Mable and Ingrid run inside. Clarke turns to George.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          You know what sucks about this? I
          like your movies and now I can't
          watch them anymore.
          Clarke walks away, then walks back.

          

          

          

          

          132.

          CLARKE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. That was mean. Through
          ail of this, I want you to know
          something. I'm glad that you're
          not sick, and I understand. And I
          forgive you.
          Clarke goes inside.

          IRA
          That was meaner than him punching
          you. That is a demented
          motherfucker.
          George punches Ira in the face. Ira fires back two punches
          at George's face and he stumbles back.

          GEORGE
          None of you fuckers can hurt me.
          George pauses, then leaps onto Ira and they roll on the
          ground for a moment. Ira makes his-way free and gets up.

          IRA
          Get the hell off of me you psycho.

          GEORGE
          Drive me home.

          IRA
          No.

          GEORGE
          How are you gonna get home then?

          IRA
          Fine.

          INT. CAR - NIGHT

          They drive in silence for a moment.

          IRA
          You are the most self involved
          person I have ever met.

          GEORGE
          Oh yeah?

          

          

          

          

          133.

          IRA
          No matter what the situation, no
          matter how many laughs or how many
          women you get you will never be
          happy. You're always going to be
          miserable. You are a bottomless
          pit. A bottomless wound.

          GEORGE
          What about you? You are just a
          lackey. Who are you to judge me?
          You tried to screw me over, after
          all I. have done for you.

          IRA
          I am not responsible for you. You
          wanted me to sit back and destroy
          this woman's life? Help you cheat
          on her? You put me in a terrible
          position. I don't give a fuck, go
          fuck yourself.

          GEORGE
          Lacky.

          IRA
          You made me the tacky? I'm not a
          lacky, it's a job.

          GEORGE
          It's not a job, you're a tacky.
          You're not even that fucking funny.
          This gets Ira very mad.

          IRA
          Who cares? If being funny means
          being like you, I rather be a
          little less funny.

          GEORGE
          Mission accomplished.

          IRA
          You're the only person I know who
          learned nothing from a near-death
          experience! You actually went
          backwards. All it did was it
          brought out what a prick you are,
          brought everything bad to the
          surface. I liked you better when I
          was sure you were gonna die.

          

          

          

          

          134.

          GEORGE
          I'm not going anywhere!

          IRA
          Everything is about you. You don't
          even know where I live. You've
          never asked me one question about
          my life. How much can one person
          talk about himself ? You never ask
          me shit about anything!

          GEORGE
          Who are you to fucking judge
          anyone? You're not my friend, you
          just want my money. You just want
          to get your foot in the door.

          IRA
          Fuck your money. Fuck you. This
          has all been a huge mistake.

          GEORGE
          Wake me when we get home.
          George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed.

          INT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT

          Music up: Ted Hawkins' song "Strange Conversation."
          Ira drives George home in the dark. Neither one speaks.
          We see images of different cities going by the window. Ira
          thinks about all he's been through and the challenges ahead,

          EXT. GUYS' APARTMENT

          Ira pulls up to his apartment.

          IRA
          okay, I'm getting out. You have to
          drive yourself home. I'm getting
          out here.

          GEORGE
          Why didn't you drive me to my
          house?

          IRA
          Because then I'd still have your
          car.

          

          

          

          

          135.

          GEORGE
          You'll drop it off later.

          IRA
          There is no later! I'm not going
          to ever talk to you again. So I
          don't want your car.

          GEORGE
          So that's how it's going to be.

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE

          George enters. There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on
          his dining room table. Several stacks of scripts. One pile
          has a big post-it note that says: "READ THESE!"

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE

          George lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's
          really bright in his room.
          George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The
          room goes dark.
          Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV
          to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and
          morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban.
          "How to Clean Up Clutter."

          ANCHORWOMAN (ON TV)
          You know, when you've got a big
          family, and you've got a lot of
          clutter...

          INT. GUYS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Ira is talking to Leo.

          LEO
          We rented out your room to Jay.
          But you can crash on the couch if
          you want.

          IRA
          Oh man, you got jerked off on that
          couch.

          

          

          

          

          136.

          JONAH
          I fucking didn't cum on the couch.
          Just sleep on it for a month, and
          then we'll find some excuse to boot
          Jay out.

          IRA
          Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way
          for a while.

          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE

          George reads one from a large pack of scripts. A few pages
          in, he clearly doesn't like it. He puts it down, picks up
          another one.
          The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like.

          INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

          Ira writes at a table.

          EXT. STORE - DAY

          George walks out of a store. A beautiful woman tries to chat
          him up, but he lets her know he i.s"busy and has to go. He
          walks off. She looks disappointed.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          Ira talks to Daisy. They seem to be getting along well.

          INT. IMPROVISATION - DAY

          Daisy is performing on stage. She gets off and heads over to
          Ira.

          I HA
          That was great.
          She kisses him.

          DAISY
          Thanks.
          The MANAGER walks over.

          

          

          

          

          13,.

          MANAGER
          Hey Ira, Federman got in a car
          accident. Do you want to take his
          spot?
          George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age.
          This young man has clearly taken his place.

          GEORGE
          Hey, how's it going?

          IRA
          Hey George.

          GEORGE
          This is Randy. He's funny, you'd
          like his stuff. It's smart.

          IRA
          I'm sure I would. I look forward
          to seeing it. Are you going on
          tonight?

          RANDY
          I hope so.

          MANAGER
          (to George)
          Do you want to go up? Ira was
          gonna take Federman's spot, but we
          can get you up if you want to?

          GEORGE
          No, that's ok. I don't want to
          take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna
          hang out tonight.

          INT. IMPROVISATION - MOMENTS LATER

          Ira is introduced. He walks onto the stage. We see George
          walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a
          table by himself.
          On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than
          we have ever seen him on stage before. He is no longer
          searching for his comic identity. He has found a way to be
          himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal
          than we have seen before.
          Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not
          seem thrown. Sometimes he seems amused.

          

          

          

          

          138.

          ANGLE ON GEORGE
          He watches from the back of the room. At first he does not
          laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the
          things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is
          proud of Ira and misses him.

          INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY

          Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with
          Chuck and Gail. He doesn't look too unhappy to be there.

          FEMALE CUSTOMER
          Is the potato salad fresh?

          IRA
          I made it myself this morning.

          FEMALE CUSTOMER
          Is it good?

          IRA
          I stake my reputation on it.

          FEMALE CUSTOMER
          Okay. Give me a quart.

          IRA
          Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would
          like a quarf'of potato salad.
          The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal
          George standing there, holding his ticket.

          GEORGE
          Do you have any turkey that's
          hormone-free?

          IRA
          Yes we do.

          GEORGE
          So this is where you work.

          IRA
          Back in the saddle.

          GEORGE
          I thought we were writing a
          screenplay.

          

          

          

          

          139.

          IRA
          Well, you're not a very good
          writing partner.

          GEORGE
          Or any kind of partner. You want
          to make me a turkey sandwich and
          talk to me? They give you breaks
          around here?

          INT. SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER

          There is a small seating area in the supermarket where people
          eat food at the deli counter. George and Ira sit across from
          each other.

          GEORGE
          In my travels, I have learned a lot
          about Asia and Buddhism. And I
          would like to be in the moment now
          with you, and to tell you how sorry
          I am, and how much I have
          appreciated your friendship. And
          even if we are not friends in the
          future, I wish you well on your
          journey.
          Ira laughs.

          IRA
          That guy was a douche-bag.

          GEORGE
          But also kind of cool. It's a very
          weird combination.

          IRA
          He was going to heal you with those
          herbs, man. You get sick again,
          you should call that guy.

          GEORGE
          I think most of what you said to me
          was true. And I really am sorry.
          I think I'm still not very
          healthy...in my brain.

          IRA
          It's all right, man. You've been
          through a lot.

          

          

          

          

          14 0 .

          GEORGE
          Well, I appreciate you trying to
          help me. Even though it was kind
          of an impossible task.

          IRA
          Is everything going okay? How are
          you doing?

          GEORGE
          I am not doing well, but things
          have certainly been worse. So, I
          will be fine.

          (THEN)
          You were good the other night. I
          hear you're getting regular spots
          now.

          IRA
          I'm actually going up tonight.

          GEORGE
          Really? Any new jokes you're
          working on?

          IRA
          Yeah, I've been trying to get off
          my ass and do some writing.

          GEORGE
          What do you got?
          Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never
          asked this before.

          IRA
          I was thinking about doing a bit
          about how I'm not very good
          looking, but I'm not bad looking,
          but I'm just good-looking enough
          that if I had a good personality,
          it might put me over the top.

          GEORGE
          You should do something about how,
          when you date a girl, and you feel
          really good and she likes you, and
          then you see pictures of all her ex-
          boyfriends, and they're all really
          goofy-looking guys, and it's not
          that you're good looking, it's just
          that in this psychotic girl's eyes,
          you're good looking?

          

          

          

          

          141,

          IRA
          And how all of her boyfriends look
          like Lou Costello.

          GEORGE
          Why don't you say Dom Deluise?
          it's a more current reference.

          IRA
          More current? What year was
          Cannonball Run, 1978?

          GEORGE
          Okay, okay. What else you got?

          IRA
          I was going to talk about how I
          haven't had sex in so long, that I
          can't even remember my previous
          sexual experiences so I can
          masturbate to them.

          GEORGE
          You should say, now when I
          masturbate, I have to think about
          the last time I masturbated.

          IRA
          That's a good one. You can write.

          GEORGE
          You know, I always wanted to be
          part of the comedy field.
          As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes
          for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in
          the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...

          2-2 Heavy, Pull upt Pull up!
          The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO
          VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi
          prayer.

          INT. AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT


          THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE:
          SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics
          and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like
          plastic pendulums. The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer.

          ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who
          remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
          reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated
          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even
          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and
          the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits
          peacefully; unaffected.

          He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
          directly on him. He looks up to

          THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN

          it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING
          continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with
          the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an

          ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture
          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins
          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls
          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in
          which he sleeps.

          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.
          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes
          stop moving.

          LARGE'S EYES slowly float open.

          Hi, hello, it's uh. Look uh, you
          don't call me back so I don't know
          how to do this. If I can't... if
          you're not gonna return my calls
          then there's no way for us to
          communicate. So uh...
          '(starts to cry)

          Look, I don't know how to do . this,
          but you're gonna need to come home
          now. Last night uh... Your mother
          died last night, Andrew. She uhh...
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But she
          uh... she drowned... last night she
          drowned in the bath...

          BEEP. The machine cuts the voice off.
          LARGE'S EYES processing.

          They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in
          data. He blinks. He blinks again slowly. His eyelids float
          closed. He falls back to sleep.

          The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink.

          INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING

          Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body
          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle
          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the
          mirror he's been staring into.

          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two
          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately
          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

          He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.

          Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.
          He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries
          to find an address while checking a piece of paper.
          He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-

          After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a
          gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.
          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the
          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
          down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the
          next level. His expression never changes.

          INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY

          A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and
          manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large
          sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him;
          they're even dressed alike.

                         ASSISTANT
          Casting, please hold. casting,
          please hold.

          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are sitting beneath an eight
          foot photograph of "Urkel" wagging his finger at the camera.
          A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other
          actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines
          to themselves.

          The ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him.

                         ACTOR
          We're whores.
          Large looks at him.

           ACTOR (CONT' D )
           "I'm not a whore," you say. And to
          that I say, "If you would do
          this... that you would do ' this...
          you're a whore." 'But it pays the
          bills," you say; startin' to get a
          little pissed. And to that I say:
          "how do whores, how do you think a
          hooker justifies what she does to
          her non-hooker friends?"

                         (BEAT)
          It pays the bills.

                         (READING)
          "Codey, an extreme, special-ope
          hacker with an edge.' What the fuck
          is an "edge"? Can you explain
          "edge" to me? Is it just messy
          hair?

                         (BEAT)
          Hey, wait. Aren't you the guy who

          An overweight casting assistant enters.

          Lukas Fox?

                         ACTOR

          (to the room)
          Hey guys, we're only doing the
          first scene okay; the "I'll cut
          you!" scene. Thanks.

                         ACTOR
          Good talking with you, bro.

                         (BEAT)
          Peace.
          We hold on Large as he swings his gaze to the actor on his
          other side aggressively running his lines to the air.

          INT. LARGE' S CAR -- DAY

          Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405
          freeway. Large stares absently out the window as BLARING
          SIRENS. compete with the obnoxious ramblings of L.A. TALK

          RADIO.
          Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in
          pain.

          EXT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on
          his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the
          restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his
          car.
          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle
          sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped
          off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last
          time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the
          nozzle from his tank.
          He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws
          the nozzle in an open dumpater.

          INT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Large flings open the door and enters a long, dark corridor
          lined with stacked chairs. He passes a WAITER in a black
          TUNIC wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian.

                         WAITER
          Dick head. You've got thirty-four
          and twenty-five seated and Taylor
          booked a pilot so he quit. You
          picked a bad night to be late.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5
          Large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any
          of the stress. He rounds a corner to a time card machine and
          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,
          "LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes
          into a black tunic and pants.
          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over
          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.
          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the
          line. Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER. She walks with
          him as he weaves his way through the kitchen.

                         FRENCH MANAGER

                         (FRENCH ACCENT)
          Ten resumes just today. They come
          in everyday from Idaho or Florida
          or Milwaukee and do you know what
          they want even more than a guest
          spot on "Everybody Loves Raymond"?
          They want your job. This will not
          happen again. This will never
          happen again. You have two tables.
          You are thirty minutes late; if I
          ever say this again, your job will

                         GO TO:
          She pulls off the top resume from the bunch she's grasping;
          revealing a headshot on the other side.

          FRENCH MANAGER (CONT'D)
          Todd Slauson from Duluth,
          Minnesota.
          During all this, Large remains calm and unphased. He takes a
          stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints
          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,
          male waiters.)
          He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of
          the tunic and turns it on. He unwinds the ear piece, pulls it
          through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his
          ear. Immediately we hear a VIETNAMESE MAN'S VOICE giving
          orders over the ear piece.

          VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)
          (accented, but monotone)
          Waiter number fifteen, your table
          number twenty-three is ready.
          Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into:

          INT. DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          A very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to
          capacity with a Friday evening crowd. The energy is
          completely different from the other side of the door. SOFT
          ASIAN MUSIC' plays, the room is very dim and lit by
          candlelight.

          waiters, eighty-six tuna special.
          Large remains dead-pan as he crosses to a table with six
          young, hot Hollywood types.

          YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY
          What the fuck, man? What are you on
          break?
          Large doesn't respond.

          YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY (CONT'D)
          Don't worry about it; I'm just
          messin' with ya. Lemme get three

                         LARGE
          We don't have bread.

                         REELING GIRL
          What do you mean you don't have
          bread? How could you not have
          bread?

                         LARGE
          We just don't have bread it's...
          we're a Vietnamese restaurant.

                         REELING GIRL
          Well you're not Vietnamese.

                         LARGE
          No, I'm not.

                         REELING GIRL
          So?

          THE BLARE OF A JET LINER TARING OFF dissolves into

          INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY

          THE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink
          in a very long row. He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his
          eyes closed in pain for a brief second.
          A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of
          sinks. As he passes each sink, he unknowingly activates their
          motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water.
          The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of
          "Once, Twice, Three Times A Lady" with synthesizer
          accompaniment.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin.
          Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking
          woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN.
          We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON
          HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her
          cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the
          tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto:
          HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words
          "ONCE and "TWICE".
          The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew
          prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father
          GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket.
          Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young
          Black woman.
          HIS FOCUS RACKS TO REVEAL two young men seated on a rusty
          tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the
          ceremony.
          WE JUMP CUT TO after the ceremony as Large weaves through the
          crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs
          26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite
          filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black
          yarmulkes.
          They look up as Large approaches.

           TIGHT ON: An enormous portrait photograph that fills a wall;
          in it, Large (as a young boy), Sarah (not yet in a

          woman and her young daughter (Cynthia) against a white

          New Jersey'ites of every shape and size mingle over small
          food and small talk. The camera moves past several

                         CONVERSATIONS:
          A heavy woman with gobs of make-up and lots of gold.

                         WOMAN 1
          .Well you had to call her; she
          never called anyone.

          This was a woman who never smiled.

          Somebody ate all the lox.
          THE CAMERA MOVES TO: Two very Jewish older ladies
          simultaneously telling the same story to a group of friends.

                         LADY 1
          The new thing is "Talk to the
          hand."

          That's what they're doing.

          Large site on a couch in the den next to his Aunt Sylvia, the
          singer from the funeral. Some young children play on the rug
          in front of them. Large stares off into space as she pets one
          of the children's heads and looks to Large for conversation.

                         SYLVIA
          Did you know your mother redid the
          hallway bathroom?
          Large looks over, realizing she's talking to him.

                         LARGE
          What? Sorry. Who?

                         SYLVIA
          Since I met her she never showed an
          interest in anything. Then all of a
          sudden a month ago she wakes up and
          decides to redecorate a bathroom. I
          helped her.

                         LARGE
          That's great.
          (trying his best)
          I'll bet it was... fun.

                         SYLVIA
          Well I sew. I made you something.

                         LARGE
          Me? Thank you. Did you... sew it?

                         SYLVIA

          Now?

                         SYLVIA
          Well just in case I have to fix it
          before you leave again and we don't
          see you for another nine years, I
          want to make sure it fits.

                         LARGE
          oh. okay.

                         SYLVIA
          You're gonna love the material. I
          used the leftovers from your
          Mother's design. Gorgeous.

          INT. HALLWAY BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Large flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is
          done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper,
          towels, curtains. He looks down at the shirt; it's the same
          pattern.
          He slides his sweater off to reveal his pale, thin chest. He
          stares at himself in the mirror for a moment. He tilts his
          head to the right and stares at his body.
          He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front. As he does
          his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the
          room. He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his
          head and forearms are floating in mid-air.
          Large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in
          mid-air.

          She's on call tonight; she
          volunteers as an EMT for the Rescue
          Squad. She's doing so well in med

                         LARGE
          Yeah, she's amazing. I'm really
          happy that everything's working out
          so well for her. She deserves that.

                         GIDEON
          I have very fond memories of the
          two of you running around here when
          you were little kids like brother
          and sister.
          Silence.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          So how are you?

                         LARGE
          I'm okay.

                         (SEARCHING)
          I've been getting these pretty bad
          headaches lately. It feels like a
          quick little lightning storm in my
          brain and then it's gone. I was
          thinking maybe you could set me up
          to get it checked out while I'm
          here.

                         GIDEON
          Go see Dr. Cohen first thing
          tomorrow morning. Re's a
          neurologist in my building. I'll
          call him and he'll fit you in. I'm
          sure it's nothing to worry about.
          Silence. Large nods.

          Actually, no. I don't know why I
          just said that. We haven't done
          anything to it.

          Yeah. That's new. Did you eat? You
          should eat. Aunt Sylvia put this
          whole thing together out there. I

          Large starts to leave.

                         GIDEON
          I'm glad you're here.
          Large stops in the doorway.

          Saying goodbye is important. I'm
          glad you could... fit it in.

          A tattered, vintage American Flag site framed above the bed.
          Large eases past all the shelves; trinkets, nothing seems to
          mean anything and then

                         A PICTURE
          Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents
          laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around
          a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous "chicken-
          foot" slippers and smile from ear to ear.
          Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the
          photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not
          yet requiring a wheelchair.
          He crosses to the bed and sits down. The surface sends waves
          ,towards the pillows throwing them off the bed, revealing it's

                         A WATERBED-
          A LOUD RING from a PHONE on the bedside table which appears
          to be made out of Legos. He answers it.

                         LARGE
          Hello?... Hey. No... Yes.

          INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

          Large pulls away a tarp to reveal a classic world War II Army
          motorcycle with a sidecar. The corner of hie mouth raises and
          holds the idea of a smile.

          EXT. STREETS NIGHT

          Large flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet. THE

          MUSIC BLASTS.
          The wind throws his hair back as Large whips through the back
          roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by
          a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS
          FLASH behind him as he pulls over.

                         LARGE
          Fuck.
          The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search
          light.

          Hands on your head, please!

          ON YOUR FUCKING HEAD PLEASE!21
          Large does it. All we can see is a silhouette of a figure
          standing amidst the blaring lights and swirling blue and red
          colors.

           You do have a license don't you.
           Large takes it. out and passes it behind him, squinting. When
           the COP gets it, he steps finally into the 1 ght. He's a
          skinny kid, maybe 23, with a baby face!

          Yeah. You too.
          Benny gets in his car and pulls up alongside Large. He picks
          up the CB and the PA CRACKLES on:

          Kenny nods his head up and down to Large like "Isn't this
          cool?" Large waves goodbye. Kenny floors the cop car and
          BLARES the SIREN with LIGHTS FLASHING as be SCREECHES away.

          TNT.GLEASON KITCHEN --- NIGHT
          A bunch of people are gathered around Mark as he tells a
          drunken story. The group laughs.

                         MARK
          holy chit look at this guy!
          Everyone looks to Large at the end of the line.

          Get the fuck up here, bitch! This
          guy does not wait for a beer! This
          is a movie star! This is Jersey's
          DeNiro and shit.
          Mark sloppily hugs Large. Others slap him five as Large
          awkwardly navigates between variations of hugs and
          handshakes.

                         DRUNK
          What are you doin home?
          A beat as Large realizes he has to answer that question.

          They walk through the crowd as Mark recruits cute girls to
          join them upstairs. They walk up the stairs past family
          pictures and school photos made crooked by drunken backs.
          Mark points to a photo of an awkward looking young man.

                         MARK

          Nah. Ugly motherfucker though, huh?
          It pains Large to even try to respond to that.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          You want to see the most fucked up
          thing?
          They arrive at the landing outside a door with a "New Jersey

          MARK (CONT`D)
          This is the tucked up thing.
          Be swings the door to the bedroom open revealing the dark
          bedroom of your average teenage boy. A teenage couple
          drunkenly makes out on the bed. The mattress has no sheets.

          Mark points to a hole in the ceiling where a ceiling fan has
          been ripped out. Wires dangle. The fan lies next to the bed.

          Everything in the room is golf. it is one man's wood paneled
          shrine to the sport of golf: golf carpet, posters,
          autographs, etc. A group of people sit around the couch
          drinking beer,. passing joints. Smoky, dark.
          Large notices JESSE, a wiry 25 year old in thick glasses.

          No. But I haven't seen you since we

                         WERE SIXTEEN-

                         JESSE
          Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an
          inventor yet. Anyway I developed
          this little item that's just like
          Velcro but doesn't make that
          annoying Velcro noise.

                         LARGE
          now much did they buy it for?

                         JESSE
          A lot.

                         LARGE
          Wow. So what are you doing now?

          Seriously.

                         JESSE
          Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've
          never been so bored in all my life.
          The first month I bought a whole
          bunch of shit, but then that got
          boring. But I... nothing.

          That's so crazy. But I mean like,
          are you gonna travel or like what
          are you gonna do? Shouldn't you
          like help starving kids or
          something?

                         JESSE
          I'm not really motivated to do much
          at all. It's kind of funny, I guess
          I had kind of planned on my whole
          life being about struggling to get
          money. But now that I've got more
          than I ever dreamed, I'm really not
          sure what to do with myself. I
          stare at walls a lot.

                         DAVE
          Can you believe that shit, Large?
          This guy has one idea and he's a
          trillionaire. I got a thousand
          ideas, but I gotta sit around and
          wait for all my relatives to die.
          They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.
          Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that
          the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty
          young; 17-19.
          As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
          GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the
          stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone
          has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.

                         MARK
          Here, bro.
          He passes Large the golf book.

                         LARGE
          Oh no thanks, man.

                         MARK
          Really? But you're like a movie
          star and shit.

                         LARGE
          No, no thanks.

          Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY
          FACE on it.

          Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks
          around at everyone else in the room eating them; including
          the cute girls.

                         LARGE
          I guess I'll see youguyslater.

          Should we play a game?

                         DAVE
          other than golf?
          They laugh.

                         KELLY
          No, let's play Spin The Bottle.
          The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group.

                         LARGE

                         (TO JESSE)
          I'm not playing Spin The Bottle;
          how old are we? or more
          importantly, how old are they?
          Jesse passes Large the joint.

                         JESSE
          They're all legal. I think.
          He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy
          voice takes control.

                         KELLY
          Well we just ate all this fuckin'

          The girl has a point.

                         MARK
          Okay, how 'bout this.
          He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to
          neck.

                         MARK (CONT'D}
          First let's finish Daddy's golf
          tequila. Then we can use this
          bottle.
          The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA
          FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the
          beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv
          start.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         26

          THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED-

          UP AND SLOW MOTION.
          The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES
          TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.

                         ALL
          Large!
          He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed
          directly at him.

                         JESSE
          Largeman, this is Dana.
          Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes
          with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

                         DANA
          Hi.

                         LARGE
          (snapping out of it)
          Oh, who's up?
          They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the
          couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in
          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She
          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her
          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.
          The MUSIC PLAYS.
          Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.
          They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

          HIS FINGERS CLUTCH HER THIGH
          They stop and look at each other. She kisses him on the cheek
          and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap.

                         JESSE
          This is gonna be a good night.
          Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images:
          people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls
          up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off
          his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and
          Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket.
          Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him
          in his helmet.
          FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands
          gripping a waist.
          Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the
          corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile..

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         27
          The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally:

          BLACKNESS.
          A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun
          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,
          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker
          the word "BALLS" is written.
          His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs
          swing left, then right. As Large site up
          THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are

          INT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

          Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning
          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to
          highlight the duet in the air.
          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea
          where he is.
          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a
          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his
          Bigfoot sighting.
          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal
          box.
          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval
          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second
          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the
          knight is gone.

          INT. KITCHEN -- LATER

          Large and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON,
          25. Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a
          cold or has just been crying. Tim is dressed as a Medieval
          Knight.
          Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal.
          Carol smokes a thin cigarette. Mark is shirtless. No one
          addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On
          Large's forehead.
          Silence but for the CLANKING of SILVERWARE and TIM'S

          SLURPING.

                         CAROL
          it's good isn't it.
          No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice.

                         CAROL (CONT'D)
          i always try to save a couple of
          marshmallows for the very end, but
          I can never make it.

          My mind wanders and I'm left with
          flakes and pink milk. And yet each
          time I pour a bowl I tell myself
          that this time, this is gonna be
          the time I'm gonna save at least
          one.

                         LARGE
          So, Tim, how long you been working
          at medieval Times?

                         TIM
          Three years. But I've only been a
          knight for two. You have to pay
          your dues. I worked in the stables
          and helped in the kitchen.

                         CAROL
          When I started he was making the
          coleslaw. It hasn't been the same
          since you got knighted.

                         TIM
          I really just stirred it.

                         CAROL
          Don't be modest. Mr. Modesty won
          the joust last night.

                         LARGE
          Congratulations.

                         TIM
          It's not that big a deal, it's
          fixed.

                         LARGE
          What was it that happened to you in
          high school? You had a thing, but
          I forgot what it was.

                         MARK
          He got the shit kicked out of him.

                         CAROL
          No he didn't.

                         MARK
          How do you know? He got the shit
          kicked out of him by Tyrell
          Freedmen.

                         LARGE
          I remember that. That was sofucked
          up. Why did he do that?

                         TIM
          I fucked him up too.

          He knocked your teeth out.

                         TIM
          He said I bit off him 'cause I got
          the same Jordans.

                         CAROL
          What?

                         LARGE
          That's right.

                         CAROL
          Who?

                         TIM
          Tyrell said I bit off him 'cause I
          got the same Jordans he did. But
          his were the red ones and mine were
          all white.

                         MARX
          Yours were red too by the time he
          was done with you.
          Everybody laughs but Tim.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          Air bloody tooth.

                         (BEAT)
          So what are those, like fake teeth
          you got now?

                         TIM
          He only chipped one tooth. So what
          are you up to now, Mark, digging
          graves?
          Silence. A SPOON CLANKS on a plate.

                         CAROL
          Mark's getting into real estate.
           Silence. Mark FLICKS open his Zippo lighter and lights a
          cigarette.

                          CAROL (CONT'D)
          Tim can speak Klingon.

          What?

                         TIM
          No, I can't.

          Yes, you can.

                         LARGE
          Like the Star. Trek guys?

                         CAROL
          Yup. He can talk in their language.

                         TIM
          She's kidding.

                         CAROL
          No, I'm not. He's being shy. Are
          you being shy?

                         MARK
          Don't be shy, Tim.

                         LARGE
          Yeah let's hear it, man?

                         TIM
          It's just made up. The guy who
          plays the wizard at work is a
          Trekky. I don't really...

                         CAROL
          He's being shy. Say what you said
          to me last night.

                         TIM
          No.

                         MARS
          Yeah, Tim. Say what you said to her
          last night.
          Silence. Everyone stares at Tim.

                         TIM
          I gotta get going anyway.

                         MARK

                         (SHARP)
          Say what you said to her last
          night.

                         TIM
          Kuntar peteeky maya. Al fook soo.
          They all stare at him. Then burst out laughing.

                         MARK
          You've got to be kidding me.

                         CAROL
          It means, "I like to mate after
          battle."

                         TIM

                         (QUICKLY)
          That's not what I said.

                         CAROL
          Yes.

                         TIM
          No, that wasn't the one I said.
          This one means "kill Kirk" and also
          'hallelujah" depending on the
          context.

                         MARK
          You must have gotten it confused
          with "Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth
          pleep."
          Theylaugh.

                         CAROL
          That was good, honey.

                         MARK
          You know what that means, Tim?

                         TIM
          No I don't know the whole language,
          I just...

                         MARK
          well I do. It means get the fuck
          out of my house before I chop your
          fuckin' head off.
          Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to
          LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop
          laughing.

                         CAROL
          Mark, he's a knight.

                         MARK
          He's just a fast-food knight.

                         TIM
          I should get going anyway.
          He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his
          chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo
          himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark
          just laugh.

                         TIM (CONT'D)
          Thanks for the cereal. By the way,
          it says "balls" on your face.
          Carol follows Tim out. Large slides to the microwave door's
          reflection.

                         CUT TO:

          IT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- LATER
          Mark and Large sit captivated by ALLIGATORS EATING ZEBRAS on
          TV. Large's forehead is now merely smeared with black ink.
          Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened,
          colored tube. He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare
          back against the torn pleather couch. Carol enters and stands
          next to them watching the TV.

                         CAROL
          What's this?
          She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the
          ashtray and lights it.

                         MARX
          What the fuck is that shit, Mom?

          Don't bring those fucking people
          here anymore, Mom. Or I'm leaving.
          I'm serious. No Medieval Times
          people in this house.
          He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down,
          forcing them both to slide over. Several cats surround her_

          MARK (CONT`D)

          It's not a scam. They show you how
          to do it. It's not hard, honey.
          Then I could retire and we could
          have our own game show.

          In China is right.

          So... what, you like sell property?

                         MARK
          It's bullshit. You were just all
          baked,out and you thought it would
          be a good idea.

                         CAROL
          Well I'm doin' it. I'm savin' up
          for those tapes. 'Cause I know what
          you could be if you just applied
          yourself.

          I do apply myself, Mom; everyday, I
          work my ass off burying dead
          people, okay? I'm only twenty-six,
          I'm not in any rush. What's your
          rush for? Just let me be, all
          right? I don't rush you.

                         CAROL
          Well then I'm gonna do them then.

          I will and then I won't let you
          come on my yacht. Large, you're
          welcome anytime, but leave your
          friend behind.
          Large LAUGHS. She checks her watch.

          Shit, I gotta go to my meeting.
          Okay.
          She stands up and then leans over and kisses Mark on the top
          of his head.

                         CAROL (CONT'D)
          Okay. Love you. Okay, bye Large
          good to see you.

                         LARGE
          Yeah. Good to see you too.
          She gets to the door, then crosses back to Mark.

                         CAROL
          Don't sit in here all day you guys;
          I took the batteries outta that
          carbon monoxide detector 'cause it
          was beeping all night.
          She slams the front door.

                         MARK
          She drives me crazy. She's gets all
          fried out and makes me feel like I
          gotta impress her all the fucking
          time. And you know what? I'm okay
          with being unimpressive; I sleep
          better.
          Large site forward abruptly.

                         LARGE
          Oh not What time is it ?

          IT. NEUROLOGIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
          Large rushes in to the counter. A female Hispanic
          RECEPTIONIST looks up.

                         LARGE
          Hi, I'm Andrew bargeman. I'm sorry.
          i'mn a little late for my
          appointment.
          She looks at her watch.

                         RECEPTIONIST

                         (SLIGHT ACCENT)
          okay, Andrew. I'm going to need you
          to fill out this paperwork for me,
          and we'll call you when we're ready
          for you.

                         LARGE
          Okay, thanks. Sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         35
          He site back down and begins filling out the form-
          The door opens and a blind woman with a seeing eye-dog
          enters. The Receptionist sees her and calls out:

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Hi Mrs. Lubin.

          MRS. LUBIN
          Oh, hello there.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Just have a seat and we'll be with
          you soon.

          MRS. LUBIN
          Thank you.
          She site. Large turns back to his paperwork. He fills out a
          line before he notices the "seeing-eye-dog" has wandered over
          to him. Large looks at him.

                         LARGE
          (cold, disinterested)
          Hi, how are you?
          The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and
          proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro.
          Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind
          woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about
          to say something to her but he stops himself.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          (under his breath)
          Get off. Off.
          The dog thrusts away.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

                         (TIGHT WHISPER)
          Stop it. Heel. No thrust.
           Finally Large gives up and decides to just let it hump away-
           He tries to return to his paperwork. Someone BURSTS OUT
          LAUGHING. Large turns to see a cute 20 year old GIRL he
          hadn't seen sitting in the corner. She wears really big
          headphones.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          Got any suggestions?

                         GIRL
          Kick his balls.

                         MRS- LUSTN
          Ready for me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         36
          The girl and Large look to each other, the receptionist is
          gone.

                         GIRL

                         (IMPERSONATING

                         RECEPTIONIST)
          Not yet Mrs. Lubin.
          The dog humps away.
          The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)

                         (SOFTLY)
          Kick his balls.

                         LARGE
          I don't want to hurt him.

                         GIRL
          It's the only way to teach them. I
          have three Dobermans. If I didn't
          kick them in the balls regularly
          I'd never get anything done.

                         LARGE
          Yeah, but I don't want to like
          destroy future generations of
          charitable dogs. Besides he's got
          to be close to finishing by now.

                         GIRL
          Not yet, here comes the lipstick.
          They sit and watch him go.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)
          Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow.
          WIDE SIDE ANGLE ON: the whole waiting room. Everything still
          but the dog's thrusting pelvis.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Mrs. Lubin?

          MRS. LUBIN
          Yes.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          We're ready for you.

          MRS. LUBIN
          Okay. C'mon Arthur.
          Arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her
          side to lead her into the office.

                         LARGE
          I feel so used.

          She laughs.

          LARGE (CON2''D)
          Thanks for your help. Or at least
          your good intentions.

                         SAM
          I recognize you.

          Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

                         SAM
          No, not from high school, from TV.
          Didn't you play the retarded
          quarterback.

          Yeah.

          Are you really retarded?
          He stares at her.

                         LARGE
          No.

                         SAM
          That's cool. Great job, man. You
          were- I mean I thought you were
          really retarded. You were just as
          good as that corky kid and he's
          really retarded. I mean if there's
          some kind of like retarded Emmy you
          could win. You'd kick Corky's ass.

                         LARGE
          I got to fill this thing out, but
          thank you for... that.

                         SAM
          Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an
          actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt
          you'd know him. He was on "Sheena"
          once as some gnome or something. I
          think that's great though.

                         LARGE
          Thank you.

                         SAM
          Oh that last scene where you make
          that speech to the whole stadium
          and your Dad gives you the thumbs
          up; that was - it was emotional. I
          mean I didn't cry, but I think my
          Dad did.

                         36
          I couldn't totally see, but he got
          up to go to the bathroom and I
          think I heard him sniffle. Could've
          been dander...

                         LARGE
          Well thanks. Thank you.

                         SAM
          So are you doing anything else?

                         LARGE
          No. Not right now I'm just...

                         SAM
          Any other retarded roles? I'm sure
          you could definitely get more of
          those.

                         LARGE
          No, I'm just auditioning and.,.

                         SAM
          I can't believe you're not really
          retarded. Jake's not a very good
          actor. I mean on "Sheens" you
          couldn't really tell 'cause he was
          in a hairy gnome suit, but he used
          to put on these really low-budge
          renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber
          musicals in our attic when we were
          kids and they were awful. It sucks
          'cause there isn't a whole lotta
          work for little people, you know?
          Anyway sorry I talk too much, fill
          out your forms.
          Large just stares at her. She's funny.

                         LARGE
          What are you listening to?

                         SAM

          No.

                         SAM
          Oh are you kidding me? You gotta
          here this one song, it'll change
          your life I promise you. Oh but you

          After a moment, he takes the phones off and hands them back
          to her. The SONG CONTINUES SOFTLY from the headphones.

          INT. NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY

          Large site alone in a barren office. He pans around the room
          staring at all the diplomas. His eyes follow them up from the
          base-board all the way up to the ceiling to reveal: there's
          actually one on the ceiling. The doctor enters.

                         DOCTOR
          Mr. Andrew Largeman.

                         LARGE
          I've been having these really
          intense headaches. They only last
          for a split second and then they're

          almost like a surge of electricity
          and then it's gone.

          I must have missed you at Shiva

          Yeah.

                         DOCTOR
          So how long have these headaches
          been going on?

                         LARGE
          Well I think I've had them in some
          form since I was a little kid. But
          they've been getting more and more
          frequent over the last year.

                         DOCTOR
          (looking at chart)
          How long have you been on the
          Lithium?

                         LARGE
          Oh uh, I've been on some form of it
          since I was ten or so.

                         DOCTOR
          And what about Paxil, Zoloft,
          Celexa, Depakote; did any of that
          ever help you?

                         LARGE
          No. I mean I don't know. It's
          recently occurred to me that I
          might not even have a problem. only
          I'd never know it, because as far
          back as I can remember I've been
          medicated. I grew up on it. I left
          them in LA. This is the first time
          I haven't had it in my body since I
          can remember.

                         DOCTOR
          Well it'll leave your body pretty
          fast. I'll write you a
          prescription.

                         LARGE
          Actually I. was thinking about
          taking a little vacation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Â¢ 42

                         DOCTOR
          Have you spoken to your
          psychiatrist about that?

                         LARGE
          E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad.
          So uh... he... I think he'd prefer
          me to stay on it. He likes to think
          it makes me happy. And I let him
          think that because he's sort of
          consumed by the idea of making
          everyone happy.

                         DOCTOR
          Well look, I'll examine you and
          give you a Catscan just so you
          won't worry that it's anything
          serious. But to be honest, I think
          the headaches are something else.
          Our bodies do very funny things
          when they're consumed with stress
          and anxiety. Things you'd never
          expect. I found my ex-best friend's
          cuff links in my wife's puree and I
          couldn't get an erection for a year
          and a half.

                         (BEAT)
          For example.

                         LARGE
          But that doesn't really feel like
          it. I mean I don't feel stressed or
          really anxious at all.

                         DOCTOR
          Well with all the Lithium he's had
          you on it's amazing you can even
          hear me right now_

                         LARGE
          Oh, right.

                         DOCTOR
          First of all, I do think you need
          to find a psychiatrist that isn't
          your father. That just's something
          that should have been remedied
          years ago. He knows better.
          Secondly, I'm not in a position to
          comment on whether or not you
          should stay on the meds or not; I
          don't know your story. But my
          opinion, since you're paying for
          it, is that those drugs may help as
          a means to an end. But if you're
          not In any sort of therapy, sooner
          or later what's ever going on in
          your mind will find a way to peek
          it's little head out of the water.
          Just something to think about.

          AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF: Large staring at the wall as he lies on
          a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel.
          AN OLD FEMALE NURSE straps him to the slab ignoring the
          OBSCENE WORDS and DRAWINGS in black marker that cover his

          THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN to reveal Large and the slab being
          sucked.into the Catscan tunnel.

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

          Large drives out of the parking lot. There, seated at the bus
          stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack
          and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand.
          He pulls up alongside her.

                         LARGE
          Why were you really there?

                         SAM

          What do you consider a lot?

                         LARGE
          Enough for people to call you a
          liar.

                         SAM
          People call me lots of things.

                         LARGE
          Is one of them "liar"?

                         SAM
          I could say "no", but how will you
          know I'm not lying.

                         LARGE
          Because I`ll choose to trust YOU.

                         SAM
          You can do that?

          It was my grandfather's. It was the
          only thing he left to anyone in my
          family and he left it to me. And I
          like it.

                         SAM
          This is the point where you ask me
          if I'd like a ride home?

                         LARGE
          It is?

          Yup.

          Would you like a ride home?

                         SAM

          sidecar,

                         LARGE
          Why not?

                         SAM
          Sidecars are for bitches. Anyone
          who gets in that thing is
          automatically your bitch. Thus, I
          will ride on the back.

          But what kind of helmet is that?

                         SAM
          You can use it on a motorcycle.
          Anyway, how's your head?

                         LARGE
          I should live through the day.

                         SAM

          They stop at a light.

          Well, I just had this idea. I
          promised this guy I'd stop by his
          house that's right up here, but I
          don't really wanna stay very long.
          So I was just thinking if you came
          with me I could say I have to take
          you home when I'm ready to go.

          kidnap me or anything, because my
          step-uncle's a bounty hunter and I

          EXT. JESSE'S MANSION'S FRONT YARD - DAY

          The poorly maintained backyard of a mansion: pools,
          fountains. Jesse stands shirtless and unshaven holding an
          enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky. The end of the arrow
          is on fire. A joint hangs from his lips. Sam and Large look
          terrified.

                         JESSE
          'Kay ready?
          He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them
          scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will
          land. It plunges into the earth three feet from Sam's foot.
          Frozen, she yanks on her ear; hard.

          okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird,

          Well you forgot and now Jelly's

          We have to get the only hamster on

          She kisses Sam on the cheek and then she's gone.
          They stand there a moment to catch their breath. Then they
          both start laughing.

          They walk into the LIVING ROOM.

          INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          Big couches with tattered afghans on them. A Christmas tree
          with the lights on in the far corner; a few unwrapped
          presents underneath. An enormous hamster labyrinth, a fish
          tank, three cats, a bird cage.

          No it's not. You don't have to say
          that just 'cause you can't think of
          anything else to say.

          I'm not. It's really nice. It's

          early on the tree, huh?

                         SAM
          Yeah, well we never got around to
          taking it down, so when it got to
          be fall again we just figured we
          might as well leave it. Are you
          freaked out? You're totally freaked
          out aren't you?

          They cross to the staircase and are met by TITEMBAY (Ti-TEM-

          Thanks.

          nice meeting you.

          So, Titembay.

                         SAM
          Yeah, he's my brother.

                         LARGE
          Is he adopted?

                         SAM
          Well kind of. My mom adopted him
          years ago from Sally Strothers. one
          of those: For the cost of a cup of
          coffee a day" kind of things.
          where she's like, "How can you sit
          there and not help the children?"
          And we just couldn't. We couldn't
          sit there and not help those
          children. So we sent him letters
          and pictures for years and then I
          got really into ice skating and we
          kind of forgot about'em. Then one
          day the phone rang and it was
          Titembay and he was at the dry
          cleaners around the corner and he
          said that he was going to school at
          Rutgers and living in the dorms,
          but since he was used to living
          with his tribe he'd much rather
          live with his family.

          Wow.

                         SAM
          Yeah and he's been here ever since.
          He's an amazing guy, you gotta hear
          some of his stories. I mean this
          guy struggled through so much
          because he wanted to learn. I think
          of what he's accomplished and I
          just feel so lazy. He's studying
          criminal justice at Rutgers right
          now and when he was a baby he was
          one of those kids with flies all
          over his face.

                         LARGE
          Wow. I mean that's great. It's a
          crazy story.

          The Wailing Wall. It's like the

          know any Jews who go to temple. The

          One day; the day of repentance. Did
          you know that most temples are
          designed with movable walls so that
          on the one day of the year when
          â¢ everyone comes to repent they can
          actually make the room big enough

          You gotta honor something a little
          more than that, like
          "Congratulations, man, you had
          life. Here's your trophy; a little
          spot in the ground to hang out in."

                         (BEAT)
          Anyway, I'm gonna put Jelly right
          here next to "Goliath", the
          Rotweiler Titembay backed over
          during his driving exam.
          She kneels down and begins to dig with a small shovel left
          nearby. Large sits down next to her and watches her dig. A
          brisk wind makes him hug his knees in for warmth.

          No. A second ago before I asked.

          Uh... Right now I was thinking... I
          was thinking that I've been going

          No, not dates. This isn't a date.

          Yeah, I uh... I haven't even really
          told you that yet, but uh... yeah
          my Mom just died.

          God, it's weird to say that out
          loud: 'My Mom died". And uh... eo

          Mom's. .. Although we loved, Jelly--

          No, it's okay. It's okay actually.
          I'm all right with it. Anyway I
          think it's what she wanted so..,

                         SAM
          How did she die?
          Large thinks about that.

          SAM (CONT ' D)
          I'm sorry, I'm so nosey. Forget I
          asked, I'm sorry. I just need to
          shut--up sometimes.

                         LARGE
          No, its okay. She uh... she
          drowned actually.
          Sam's jaw drops.

                          LARGE (CONT'D)
          My Mom was a paraplegic; she had
          uh... she was in a wheelchair. She
          was uh... taking a bath and then I
          guess she slipped or something.
          That's what they say. I don't know.
          But needless to say, she drowned.
          And so... that's how she died.
          Sam is speechless. Tears well in her eyes.

                         SAM
          When?

                         LARGE
          This was uh... Hmm... Sunday.

                         SAM
          Oh my God.
          Tears roll down her face.

                         LARGE
          (with a laugh)
          Why are you crying?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         58

                         SAM
          I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not
          usually like this. It's just so
          sad. It's so tragic. Isn't it? It
          is. It's like real life tragedy or
          something.

                         LARGE
          Look, let's change the subject,
          okay? Let's really bring the focus
          back to Jelly. I mean what could be
          ruder than talking about someone
          else who died while you're in the
          act of burying a close friend.
          Sam places the box in the hole she's dug.

                         SAM
          What should we do?

                         LARGE
          Well IIve only been to one of these
          things,
          (re: the other graves)
          you appear to be the expert.

                         SAM
          We usually say something.

                         LARGE
          okay, well I'll go first. I didn't
          really know you, Jelly. But from
          what I hear, you were a good pet.
          Had a little trouble with the
          wheel...

                         SAM
          its not funny. Jelly you were a
          great pet.
          Tears roll down her face.

                         SAM (CONT'O)
          I'm so, so sorry I forgot to take
          the wheel out of the cage. I'm so
          sorry about that.

                         (BEAT)
          Goodbye. I hope that you liked me.
          Tears stream down her face as she shovels dirt onto the tiny
          shoe box. THE PATTER of the SOIL HITTING the BOX is the only
          sound we hear as:
          THE CAMERA CRANES UP above them to a bird's-eye perspective
          settling on a final frame that looks down on the whole
          backyard: the above ground pool, the pet cemetery and in the
          bottom right corner, Sam burying as Large watches.

          INT. LARGEMAN MANSION: LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Once again Shiva is in full swing.
          Large passes through a doorway and begins to hear a
          COMPUTERIZED SEEPING to the tune of the "ShmaÂ°. (A Jewish
          prayer.) He looks to his left to see an electronic Mazooza on
          the door frame. it says The Sharper image" on the bottom.
          He moves his head back and forth past it's censor and each
          time it begins the BEEPING of the Shma anew.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          A tired looking man in his 50's eating a cookie.

                         TIRED MAN
          Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to
          be musicals. As in Broadway
          musicals. Can you believe that?
          Paul's kid's theme was the Meta; I
          got to do the Elora with Mookie
          Wilson. Miriam and I were at one
          last weekend at the Pierre; whole
          thing was like a winter
          wonderland... live penguins wearing
          yalmulkas. Now me, I got to lay out
          ten grand alone for some asshole to
          build a barricade of French garbage
          across the boccie lanes at my
          tennis club.
          THE CAMERA PICKS UP LARGE holding a plate of food: as he
          approaches Cynthia. She sits alone with a big photo album on
          her lap.

                         LARGE
          I was just thinking-

                         (BEAT)
          I was just thinking you spend
          you're whole life lusting for
          anything you don't have. You stress
          over money and your career, you set
          your clocks back, you exercise, you
          wait in line, you paint your house,
          get depressed, feel better, buy
          things, take your clothes to the
          dry cleaner, set your clocks
          forward and spend your whole life
          waiting for happiness to arrive in
          the mail. Then you die and people
          are really sad, they cry really
          hard...

          and then they go eat lunch.

          Oh please be a little more
          interesting than that.

          Please don't be the brooding guy.
          That's so unoriginal. I'd rather
          hold onto who I imagined you'd
          become.

                         LARGE
          Miss me?

                         CYNTHIA
          No. Me?

                         LARGE
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          She didn't like being alive. She
          got what she wanted. This should be
          a party. Instead we're supposed to
          mope. About what? She never did
          anything.

                         CYNTHIA
          She made you.

                         LARGE
          some trophy. I do have to say I'm
          impressed with the turnout.

                         CYNTHIA
          What, you didn't think people would
          come?

                         LARGE
          Seems to me the only thing more
          depressing than a funeral is a
          funeral where no one shows up.
          Don't you ever think about who'll
          show up to yours?

                         CYNTHIA
          No. Right now I'm alive, so I think
          about living.

                         LARGE
          It's one way to determine who your
          friends are. The people who'd show
          up at my funeral if it was held in
          their state, that's one level of
          friend. But my real friends, the
          people who really love me, they'd
          come if it was on the other side of
          the country.

                         CYNTHIA
          So where do I fall into that?

                         LARGE
          You'd be there.

                         CYNTHIA
          Oh you think so?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         61

                         LARGE
          I do. I think you'd show up because
          the truth is, that you really did
          miss met you always thought of me
          as the brother you never had. But
          you've got too much pride to let me
          know that. You want to pout 'cause
          I don't return your calls.

                         CYNTHIA
          you're way more talkative than I
          remember.

                         LARGE
          Today I've been more talkative than
          I remember.

                         CYNTHIA
          What about mine?

                         LARGE
          Funeral? Honestly? I probably
          wouldn't travel for it- no. But
          don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a
          great turnout.

                         CYNTHIA
          Why do you say that?

                         LARGE
          'Cause there's also the guy who
          lives his life to insure a good
          turnout. I think that's how my Dad
          lives his-, like he's sort of
          writing his own eulogy as he goes
          and making life choices dependent
          on how it will sound in a speech.

                         CYNTHIA
          Are you implying that that's why
          I'm going to med school or
          something?

                         LARGE
          I'm just saying a lot of people -
          not necessarily you - a lot of
          people try and accumulate accolades
          that will somehow justify their
          lives.

                         CYNTHIA
          It's said we spend ninety-five
          percent of our lives trying to look
          good.

                         LARGE
          Where do I sign up for not caring?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         62

                         CYNTHIA
          How about sucking it up and really
          having it out with your Dad? That
          would be a tremendous step towards
          not needing to look good.

                         LARGE
          Wow, that was so clever how you did
          that. Is he grooming you to be a
          psychiatrist too? Med school's one
          thing, but please don't become him.

                         CYNTHIA
          He's one of the most caring people
          I've ever met.

                         LARGE
          well you would say that; you're the
          son and daughter he never had.
          Hell, you're the family he never
          had. Has he got you on Lithium
          yet? Wait till he does, you'll love
          him even more.
          He stands.

                         CYNTHIA
          I bet my Mom a dollar you were
          coming home with a message. I said
          after nine years, he's definitely
          coming home with a message.

          INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

          Large enters the kitchen where JANICE, 50's, Cynthia's Mom,
          is doing the dishes. He walks over to the counter near the
          sink and just stares off across the room. She dries her hands
          and moves to Large. She opens her arms. After a beat he steps
          into her embrace. He rests his head on her shoulder and
          closes his eyes. Neither says a word.

          THE MOUTH OF THE FAUCET
          as it wells with water and overflows to DRIP onto the drain.
          Large crosses to the tub and tries to tighten the faucet to
          stop it from dripping. It continues to DRIP. He stares at the
          empty tub.

          GIDEON (O.S.)
          Hi.
          Large jumps around and puts his hand to his chest.

                         LARGE
          Holy shit, you scared the shit out
          of me.
          He covertly slips the perfume bottle into his pocket.

                         GIDEON
          Just wake up?

                         LARGE
          Yeah.

                         GIDEON
          Sleep all right?

                         LARGE
          Yeah... fine.

                         GIDEON
          Mmmm.

                         (BEAT)
          I haven't even really been in here
          for a while. I've been using the
          one in the hall. Shower pressures
          awful in there though. It's by no
          means as good a bathroom as this
          one is. This one is- well we redid
          all this. Its uh...
          (beat, catching himself)
          This is hard.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         64

                         LARGE
          Yeah.
          Silence. The FAUCET DRIPS. They avoid eye contact.

                         GIDEON
          Janice will make you some lunch.

                         LARGE
          Yeah... good.

                         GIDEON
          Well I guess it's breakfast for
          you. What time is it?

                         LARGE
          Yeah.
          Silence. DRIP. DRIP

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          Look, I wanted to ask you... I mean
          if you don't want to talk about
          this its perfectly fine, but I'm
          just...

                         GIDEON
          No I can. I know. I figured you
          would want to...

                         LARGE
          But we don't have to do it now. I
          mean you don't have to do that now.
          It's just at some point I would...
          I have some questions.

                         GIDEON
          I knew that you would.
          Silence.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Occasionally she would hum.., your
          Mother. Always the same tune and I
          never knew what the song was. I
          don't even know if it was a song or
          if she just made it up - It's funny
          because it always struck me as so
          out of character for her and every
          time she did it... I just always
          liked it. But I never told her I
          could hear her because I knew if I
          ever did she would stop.

                         (BEAT)
          She took a bath every night. And
          she was always very quiet.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         65
          The only thing I would ever hear
          when I'm in the bedroom was a
          little splashing of water when she
          was moving around. And every now
          and then, her humming.

                         (BEAT)
          so anyway, then usually she would
          call me when she was done, so I
          could come and help her out. But
          this time, that night... she never
          called. And I just figured she was
          taking a longer bath or something,
          but when I called out to her, she
          didn't answer. So then I uh... When
          I came in, she was there.

                         LARGE
          So she didn't yell or...

                         GIDEON
          No. I didn't hear anything. The TV
          was on pretty loud. I always watch
          the weather report before I go to
          sleep.

                         LARGE
          It's just weird.

                         GIDEON
          What?

                         LARGE
          I don't know, it's just that you'd
          think if someone was really
          drowning to death they would
          scream. I mean really scream from
          the terror of it all, you know?
          They would splash and scream I
          would think; I would have thought.

                         GIDEON
          I would have too, but no. Nothing.
          (off Large's look)
          What?

                         LARGE
          Don't take this the wrong way.

                         GIDEON
          What ?

                         LARGE
          I'm not reading into this, I'm just
          thinking out loud so don't get

                         UPSET-

                         GIDEON
          What? No.

                         LARGE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         66

                         GIDEON
          Its not that.

                         LARGE
          I'm just saying did they check? I
          mean has someone ruled that out?

                         GIDEON
          No. Because they know she drowned,
          Andrew.

                         LARGE
          I'm just saying the facts.

                         GIDEON
          No.

                         LARGE
          And I suppose it doesn't even
          really matter. But I'd be curious
          to know. I would like to know if
          that's what happened; just for me.
          I mean would that surprise you?

                         GIDEON
          No. Yee!

                         LARGE
          She made it very clear to everyone
          she knew that nothing was ever
          going to make her happy-

                         GIDEON
          I know! Do you think I don't know?!

                         LARGE
          And c'mon let's be honest; she
          tried it before.

                         GIDEON
          Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking
          mouth.
          Large is taken aback.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)

                         (FIGHTING TEARS)
          If nothing else will you please
          just leave, her alone. She's gone.
          That's it. That's all you get. She
          died. We will never see her again.
          She tried very hard, but she just
          couldn't find it. She could never
          find it. And I think - I know that
          she's found it now. I know that.
          And I know there's a certain amount
          of guilt that you must feel for the
          way things unfolded, but it's too
          late now.

                         67
          So I'm asking you, for me, not to
          do that. Don't... come here and do
          that.

                         LARGE
          I think I deserve to know the
          truth.

                         GIDEON
          You want to make her crazy. Why?
          Does that make it easier for you?
          Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet
          and cries.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          It's like you want to torture
          yourself or something! Why would
          you want to think that? That that
          happened. Why would you ever want
          to think that?
          Large moves closer to his father who SOBS with his head in
          his lap and his arms over his head. It takes everything Large
          has to reach out his hand and almost touch his father's
          shoulder, but he doesn't make it and his hand lands on the
          sink next to him.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          I just want everyone to be happy
          again.

                         (BEAT)
          I dreamt last night that I had
          special powers. If I squeezed my
          eyes shut and clinched my fiats
          closed tight enough, we'd all wake
          up in paradise.
          (with a laugh through

                         TEARS)
          I was like a superhero... and that
          was my power.

           FADE TO BLACK:

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          A giant rusted yellow tractor sits parked by an open grave-
          Large and Jesse lean against opposite tombstones facing each
          other.
          Mark stands in the open grave STEALING VALUABLES FROM AN OPEN
          COFFIN. A small PILE OF JEWELRY sits beside the grave.

                         MARK
          How could you leave all that
          Lithium? I was totally gonna hit
          you up for some.

          back, man, because this town is so
          messed up. Everyone's got there
          drug of choice like in "Brave New
          World". Did you ever read that
          book? Who wrote that? Aldous
          something. Aldous-

          Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLED

                         NONSENSE AS
          SLOW MOTION: LARGE STARES in shock as Mark drops a WEDDING
          RING into the PILE OF JEWELRY he's stealing off the corpse.

          MARK LOOKS UP AT LARGE STARING AT HIM AND HIS LOOT. THEY HOLD
          EYE CONTACT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT. Large breaks it and
          looks away.

                         REGULAR MOTION:

          Huxtable. That's it.

          INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Sam and Large are looking through a photo album. Olivia
          enters with an enormous Parrot on her shoulder.

                         OLIVIA
          Andrew would you like to see Sam's
          ice skating tape?

                         SAM
          Mom, no.

                         LARGE
          Absolutely.

                         OLIVIA
          She was so ahead of her time. She
          could have gone to the Olympics.

                         SAM
          No, I couldn't have.

                         OLIVIA
          Yes, you could have. Don't blame it
          on the epilepsy, you had a gift.
          Large looks to Sam, but she avoids eye contact with him-

                         LARGE
          C'mon let me see it.

                         OLIVIA
          Let's just show him the "Florida
          Stars of the Ice" opening; the
          Gator costume.

                         SAM
          Mom. I'm asking you seriously.

                         LARGE
          Don't be shy. Just let me see it.

                         OLIVIA
          Oh, she wants you to see it. How
          could you not want him to see how
          talented you are?

                         SAM
          Were.
          They cross to the TV room where they find Titembay wearing
          rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the
          coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text
          book. White powder reveals fingerprints (and pawprints)
          everywhere, including the TV screen.

                         OLIVIA
          Honey what are you doing?

                         TITEMBAY
          I'm dusting for prints.

                         OLIVIA
          Well do you think we could move the
          crime scene to the kitchen? I want
          to show Andrew Sam skating.

                         TITEMHAY
          But someone's been pissing on my
          Gamecube and I'm about to close the
          case.

                         OLIVIA
          It wasn't me your honor.

                         TITEMBAY
          The pawprints point to a canine.

                         OLIVIA
          Andrew come sit down here next to
          me.
          Large sits next to Olivia on the couch between snoring
          Dobermans. He places his glass of water on the table. Sam
          stands in the doorway.

                         SAM
          I can't believe you're showing him
          this.

                         70
          THE SHAKY, AMATEUR VIDEO comes up on the screen: a person in
          a full alligator costume wearing white gloves skates onto the
          ice. The lights come down except for a spotlight on the
          alligator.

                         OLIVIA
          There she is.

                         LARGE
          You're the alligator?

                         OLIVIA
          You can tell by the hands.
          The alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on
          the TV screen to classical music. We begin to see that Sam is
          a talented skater. In a very odd way, it's beautiful.

                         TITEMBAY
          Here comes the Double Axle...

                         OLIVIA
          And... land! I mean come on. Isn't
          she good?
          Large, Titembay and Olivia APPLAUD. As they do, the LIGHTS in
          the room SWITCH ON and OFF. Titembay CLAPS twice to turn them
          back on.

                         OLIVIA (CONT'D

                         LARGE

          That was so good. You're Mom's
          right you were amazing.
          Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water
          glass revealing his fingerprints.

          Okay this was great, but we have to

          INT. BAR -- NIGHT

           Sam and Large sit in a booth of a local Irish pub drinki ng
           pints. They're buzzed.

                         LARGE
          It was the only thing I ever really
          liked doing; pretending to be
          someone else.

          But I've been so out of it the only

          play handicapped people.

          It's not funny.

                         SAM
          Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a
          joke. If you can't laugh at
          yourself life's gonna seem a lot
          longer than you'd like.

                         LARGE
          So what should we laugh at you
          about?

                         SAM
          I lied again. I have epilepsy.

                         LARGE
          Which part are we laughing about?

                         SAM
          I had a seizure in the law office
          where I work and they said their
          insurance would only cover me if I
          wore "preventative covering".

          Preventative covering?

                         SAM
          The helmet I was carrying.
          Large is silent.

          SAM (CONT' D)
          Oh come on, that's funny. I'm the
          only person in the world wearing a
          helmet to work who isn't putting
          out fires or racing for NASCAR. But
          what do you do? I can't quit; their
          insurance is amazing. What can you
          do? You laugh. I'm not saying I
          don't cry a lot, but in between I
          laugh and realize how silly taking
          anything very seriously is. And
          plus, I look forward to a good cry.
          I just love the way it feels.

                         LARGE
          I haven't cried since I was a
          little kid. I didn't cry at my
          mother's funeral. I wanted to-

                         (A SMILE)
          I... tried. I thought of all the
          saddest things I could think of;
          things in movies, this image from
          Life magazine that haunts me...
          nothing came.

          That actually made me sadder than
          anything; the fact that I felt no
          numb.

          EXT. JESSE'S POOL -- NIGHT

          A palatial swimming pool in the backyard of Jesse's mans ion.
          The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance.
          Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school
          girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of
          the pool.

                         MARK
          One, two, three!
          Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He
          stands there staring at the water.

                         SAM
          Hey! what are you doing?

          Dude maybe you should stay on the
          steps; I don't know CPR.

                         MARK
          You look like a drunken beaver.
          They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps.
          She smiles at him.

          cramp.

          She floats on her back beside him.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          So how long are you gonna stay
          here?

                         LARGE

          Oh. I think I'll probably head home
          the day after tomorrow. well, LA.
          That's not my home.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          You know that point in your life
          when you realize that the home you
          grew up in isn't really your home
          anymore? And all of a sudden, even
          though you have a place where you
          put your Shit, the idea of "home',
          is gone.

                         SAM
          I still feel at home in my house.

                         LARGE
          You'll gee when you move out. It
          just kind of happens one day and
          it's gone. And you feel like you
          can never get it back. it's like
          you feel homesick for a place that
          doesn't even exist. But maybe it's
          like this rite of passage, you
          know? And you won't ever have that
          feeling again until you create a
          A new idea of "home" for yourself,
          for the family you start, for your
          kids. It's like this cycle.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe that's all a family really
          is; a group of people who miss the
          same imaginary place.
          They hold eye contact. The SPLASH of a CANNONBALL swings
          their gaze to the others horsing around in the deep end. Sam
          leans her head over and rests it on his shoulder.

                         SAM
          Maybe.

          INT. JESSE'S MANSION: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

          An enormous and desolate LIVING ROOM devoid of any furniture
          or decoration. Mark, Jesse, Sam and Large sit huddled under
          towels at the foot of a colossal fire place that houses a
          small blaze. They eat potato chips and drink canned beer.
          They are all pretty tipsy. Mark plays with a "Silent Velcro"
          sample.

          They all laugh.

          So why did they send you away?
          She takes a sip of her beer.

          involved.

          the dishwasher was open. The latch

          Well I was nine. They sent me to
          therapy and my Father put me on
          these drugs that were supposed to
          "curb my anger". And I've been on
          some form of them ever since. My
          Mother who was clinically depressed
          before the accident, sank even
          lower to the point where she just
          ignored everyone but our
          housekeeper, Janice and her
          daughter, Cynthia. And when I was
          sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came
          around to the conclusion that it
          might not be the healthiest
          environment for me to be growing up
          in. So he sent me to boarding

          They squeeze down a long dark corridor filled with graffiti.
          They come upon a young teen staring through a peep hole in
          the wall. Mark taps him on the shoulder. He turns his head
          and nods in recognition.
          When he pulls away from the peep hole, the LIGHT PROJECTS THE

          IMAGE OF THE MOTEL ROOM ON HIS FACE .

          (Yes, that really happens.) As he looks at Mark, Sam and
          Large, his forehead is filled with the image of a BUSINESS
          MAN brushing his teeth. Mark leans into his ear.

                         (SUBTITLED)
          Down the hall. There's a hooker in
          room 112.. It's crazy down there. I
          figured I'd just chill with this.
          SLOW MOTION: Mark gestures for Large and Sam to follow him
          down the hall. The hall is strewn with young men staring
          into peep holes. As Mark, Sam and Large pass them, the
          Peeping Tom's each turn to see who it is.
          As they turn, each one has the image of what they're watching
          projected on their face. We hear the ECHOES of the SOUNDS
          FROM the ROOMS.
          -- An old couple slow dancing projected on another teen.
          REGULAR MOTION: They arrive at the end of the hall where a
          group of six young guys are glued to the image being
          projected onto the wall opposite the peep hole. An old camera
          lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image
          to appear in perfect focus.
          The projection shows a very hot, YOUNG HOOKER getting taken
          from behind by an OLDER GREASEBALL. Her face is no more than
          three feet from the peep hole. The HOOKER'S MUFFLED MOANING
          can be heard from the other side of the wall.
          Everyone's eyes are glued to the wall. Large notices one kid
          has duct tape over his mouth, while another is sweating
          profusely. Sam's jaw is dropped open.

          GRBASESALL (0.5.)
          I'm fucking you! I'm fucking you.
          Large notices another kid lip-synching along with the
          Greaseball. Mark spots DIEGO, a Hispanic guy, 32, wearing a
          bell-hop uniform and gestures him closer.

          close to this.

          Who's fuckin' you? Hub? Who's
          fuckin' you?
          The Lip-Synching Kid mouths, "You are."

          Dude we're kind of in a rush.

                         DIEGO
          You can wait, he's about to cunt.

          I'm gonna fucking cum!
          Diegogestures, "Told you."

                         HOOKER
          Cum on my back!
          The group responds in silent shock. Jaws drop, Diego grabs
          his hair with his fists. Just as they are about to climax, we

          Mark, Diego, Large, Sam and others rush out into the outer
          room.They speak in quiet whispers.

          That shit was hot! I got to go drop
          some knowledge on that ho.

                         SAM
          How do you know she's a hooker?

                         DIEGO
          of course she's a fucking hooker.
          Girls that look like her do not
          fuck guys that look like him unless
          it's for money, coke or fame.

          Why are you bringing these people
          here?

                         MARK
          He's the guy who needs that thing.
          Look I brought you the tank, so can
          you just tell us where to go now?

          All right. Hold-up. Who here just
          saw some titties?!
          They all stare.

          They all raise their hands. (Including Sam.)

          Thank you. So everybody needs to

          At the bottom of the quarry there's
          this Junkyard run by this guy named

          you haven't told me what the fuck

          we were going on a six hour

          have passed.

                         MARK

          Yes, you are. And that's what I
          like about you. And I don't want

          bottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass
          neighborhood to find some Pitbull's

          Don't talk about knights in front
          of Mark. It's a sore subject.

          Beat as Mark gets it. He comes after him.

                         MARK
          You're dead.
          They play wrestle as Sam watches.

          EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal...

          AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY
          Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the
          distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti.
          The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the
          bottom. They stand on the edge. Rain clouds rapidly drift
          overhead. This glace is surreal.

                         SAM
          Wow.

                         LARGE
          I never even knew this was here.

                         MARK
          I've heard about it. They were
          supposed to build a mall here I
          think.

          They were digging one day and they
          broke through into this like
          natural phenomenon. It's like an
          underground Grand Canyon or
          something. So now they're in some
          huge legal battle over whether they
          can build here or not.

          alongside the abyss.

          Further down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop
          handle he's found as a walking stick.
          As they continue along the path it begins to get continually
          cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub,
          remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.
          Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY
          FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that
          sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm
          and welcoming.
          Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he
          expected. Rain begins to fall.

                         MARK
          I guess this is it.

          hobbies. I don't tease you about
          being an asshole.
          They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark
          steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.

          After a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid-
          thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears
          on the deck. He smiles warmly-

          Mark?

                         ALBERT
          (with a smile)
          Yes. Come on in out of the rain.
          Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A-
          frame ladder that sits next to the hull.

          INT. ALBERT'S BOAT -- CONTINUOUS

          They step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very
          cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats
          the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM
          with deep cushy couches.

                         ALBERT
          You guys must be freezing. Make
          yourselves warm by the fire. I'm
          just gonna go put her down. I'll be
          right out.
          The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet
          whispers.

                         SAM
          I must say, I've been continually
          impressed today with how each new

          It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did

          Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring

          Diego told me when he called.
          Please have a seat, make yourselves
          comfortable.

                         FAYE
          Its really coming down out there,
          huh?

                         LARGE
          Yeah, it just started pouring all
          of a sudden.

                         ALBERT
          Well in a bad storm I like to
          pretend this old boat's my own
          private "ark". Unfortunately, if
          this is the apocalypse, I'm not
          quite sure it still floats.

                         FAYE
          Would any of you like some tea?

                         SAM
          I'd love some tea.
          Large and Mark look at her.

                         LARGE
          No thanks.

                         MARX
          No.. thanks.
          Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely
          nodding at each other.

                         LARGE
          What is it that you do here? What
          is this place?

                         ALBERT
          Good question. We're calling it
          Kiernan's Fault. And no one's
          really quite sure what it is
          because they haven't been able to
          explore it. They're locked in a
          legal battle over who has the
          rights to the land.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         102
          So one of these days it will either
          be a national park or a shopping
          mall. But while their locked in
          litigation, I was hired to make
          sure no one comes inside.

                         LARGE
          Oh. Wow.

                         ALBERT
          What they don't know is that I'm a
          geologist working undercover for
          the preservation lobby. So, at
          night... I go down.

                         FAYE
          He's documenting it to support
          their case.

                         SAM
          Wow. So how deep does it go?

                         ALBERT
          No one really knows. I've been in
          the furthest and that was about two
          miles down. But I like to pretend
          it's infinite.

                         11
          Faye brings them tea.

                         SAM
          It's kind of an odd job isn't it?
          Guardian of an infinite abyss?

                         ALBERT
          Yeah, I guess it is. We also trade
          and deal in antique jewelry. I
          suppose it's pretty odd for you that
          we live down here like this-

                         SAM
          No.

                         LARGE
          Not at all.

                         MARK
          Never crossed my mind.

                         ALBERT
          But we think it's important.

                         LARGE
          Why? What do you think you'll find?

                         ALBERT
          I don't know. It's exciting. New
          frontiers are hard to come by these
          days. I guess I just like the idea
          of discovering something.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         103
          Doing something completely unique
          that no one's ever done before.
          Large looks to Sam.

                         LARGE
          Yeah. "Albert's Abyss".

                         ALBERT
          Who knows? Maybe. But I used to
          think that was all that mattered.
          No matter what it was, as long as I
          could put my name on it. Like it
          would somehow justify the fact that
          I lived; that I was here. "I did
          that. That's mine. I got this plate
          on my travels." But you know what?
          That's all ego; none of that stuff
          really matters. If at the end of
          the day I get to be with her, if I
          get to be with this person right
          here and the baby we created, then
          that's all I need. Just having
          felt that... If I die in an hour, I
          know I've lived.
          Faye kisses his forehead.

                         LARGE
          You know "my whole life I've had
          that same anxiety that if I didn't
          discover something or... save
          something or...

                         SAM
          Save something from being
          discovered.

                         LARGE
          Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted
          my time here. And that somewhere,
          whatever force created us, would
          resent me for it.

                         ALBERT
          Well I think that force would
          rather remind you that "breathing's
          all it takes to be a miracle".
          He takes a deep breath. Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert;
          TRANSFIXED. He's like a sage.

          GREAT MUSIC BEGINS.

                         ALBERT
          Well i suppose you want what you
          came all the way down here for.

                         MARX
          Yeah, that would be great.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         104

                         ALBERT
          It took me awhile to track this
          piece down. But I owe Diego huge.
          He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to
          Mark. Mark looks inside and nods his head.

                         MARK
          That's it. Thank you.
          They all stand.

                         SAM
          Well thank you for the tea.

                         LARGE
          Yeah, thanks.

                         FAYE
          Okay, good luck in the rain. Would
          you like some garbage bags or
          something?

                         LARGE
          Yeah, that would be great.

          EXT ALBERT'S HOUSE BOAT--DAY
          They open the door and venture into the, DOWN POUR in their
          garbage bag parkas.

                         ALBERT
          Good-bye.
          Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway.
          As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the
          path. Large turns back' around.

                         LARGE

                         105

          THE GREAT MUSIC CONTINUES
          SLOW MOTION: Mark, Sam and Large in black garbage bag rain
          parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half
          speed.
          Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm
          hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base.
          REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with
          everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss.
          Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to
          join hint.
          The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair
          drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can,
          with everything they have in the POURING RAIN.
          FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect
          moment.
          UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her.
          They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and
          they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE -- LATER

          The rain has stopped as Large's motorcycle pulls up in front
          of Mark's house. mark gets out of the sidecar.

                         LARGE
          So I don't know if I'm gonna see
          you.

                         MARK
          I know. Don't you wanna know what's
          in the bag?

                         LARGE
          To be honest, I don't even care
          anymore.
          Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80
          wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a
          square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.

                         MARK
          I'd be lying to ya if I told ya
          this was my plan all along.

                         (BEAT)
          But I got it back. That's got to be
          worth something, right?

                         LARGE
          This whole day was about this?

                         MARK

                         (NODDING)
          And anyway you didn't want it down
          there with her. It's better for you
          to have it.
          Large shakes his head; he's shocked. Mark backs away, still
          wearing his garbage bag parka.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you
          know where to find me.
          Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms. He
          stares at the pendant in his hand.

                         SAM
          What is it?

                         LARGE
          It's my Mom's favorite necklace.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. MASTER BATHROOM -- NIGHT

          They sit, soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where
          Sarah Largeman drowned,, cross-legged facing each other.
          Large wears the necklace around his neck. He plays with the
          pendant...
          EXTREME CLOSE-UP INSIDE TEE PENDANT: It's an antique game
          where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three
          separate indentations.

                         LARGE
          No. I don't want to play this game.

                         SAM
          Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting
          here, across from you and you can
          say anything at all. All the things
          you never got a chance to say.

                         (BEAT)
          No?

                         I (BEAT)
          Well I don't want to push you. I
          just thought it might help. I mean
          isn't that what you came home for?
          Re stops playing with the necklace and takes a deep breath.

                         LARGE
          Okay.

                         (BEAT)
          I would...

                         (BEAT)
          If she were sitting here.

                         107
          if my mother were sitting here I
          would tell her...
          Silence. The faucet DRIPS behind him.

                         SAM
          What?

                         LARGE
          I really don't wanna...

                         (BEAT)
          I would tell her that I'm sorry.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry that she wasn't happy.
          And I'm sorry I couldn't make her
          happy. And you know if I could have
          had anything I ever wanted to have
          happen in my life actually ever
          happen, it would have been that she
          would be happy. And...
          A tiny tear wells in his lid and. spills over.

                         SAM
          Oh, my God, Large I think I see
          one.

                         LARGE
          Shut-up.

                         SAM
          Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should
          save it or something.
          She finds a clear plastic cup.

          SAM (COUT' D)
          Here don't move, I'm gonna get it.
          She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like
          a child capturing an inch worm.

                         LARGE
          I guess I could put it in my
          scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook.
          They wait.

                         SAM
          Is that it?

                         LARGE
          I think so. I don't feel any more
          coming.

                         SAM
          Well if you do, let me know and
          I'll grab the cup, okay?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         108

                         LARGE
          Yeah.

                         SAM
          This was a good idea. Keep talking.

                         LARGE
          It's funny; this thing reminds me
          of this really random memory of my
          mother. Its so weird, I haven't
          thought about this in so long, but
          this great memory I have where I
          was a little kid and I was crying
          for one reason or another and she
          was kind of holding me and rocking
          me back and forth. And I could see
          the little balls in this thing just
          rolling back and forth. And there
          was just snot dripping down my
          nose.

                         (HE LAUGHS)
          And she just handed me her sleeve
          and told me to just blow my nose
          into it. And I remember thinking,
          even as a very little kid, "Wow.
          This is love."
          More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries
          to stifle them with a LAUGH. He cradles the pendant.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          This is love. And it just felt
          so... good to be there. So safe.
          And I didn't feel safe very often,
          but at that moment...
          Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's. She
          holds the plastic cup in her hand.

                         SAM
          oh, Large I'm never gonna be able
          to get all these.
          They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his
          waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          I'm never gonna be able to get all
          these, am I?

                         LARGE
          It's so funny isn't it? But I
          think that's the single most
          amazing moment I remember of my
          Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and
          she wasn't being prodded to be
          happy, she was just there.

                         SAM
          To be your Mom.

          He node and tightens his lips; trying to hold in the faucet
          that his eyes have become; a monumental release. He almost
          looks like a different person. They stare directly into each
          other's eyes. He turns away; it's too vulnerable a place for
          him.

          Look at me.
          He does. And we see a vulnerable, lonely, little boy.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          (in a whisper)
          Let go. Listen to me. Just don't
          hang onto any of it anymore. You're
          holding on so tight and you just...
          you don't have to hang onto any of
          it anymore. Just let it all go.

          Just let it all go.
          He cries with his elbow over his eyes.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          What do you feel? Describe it. That
          always helps me. My mom always
          says, "What's the word that's
          burning in your chest..."
          She touches his chest with her hand.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          What is it?
          He looks away. Soared.

          Yeah, it is.

          And you've got so much of it in
          you... God, you do. You've got so
          many years of it in you, pleading
          to come out.

          This fucking hurts.

          if nothing else...
          (pointing to his chest)
          That is life. St's real. And
          sometimes it burns. But maybe... it
          might be all there is.

          Look at you. Look at you. You look

          I'm your new friend, Sam.
          Holding up her sleeve.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          Tissue?
          They both laugh; a release.

                         LARGE
          Fuck. I feel like I just get so
          much thrown at me; like there's so
          much speeding by me in a day that I
          feel like if I look up from the
          sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall
          down. So it's like I just...
          barrel through and don't look up,
          so I'll just never fall, you know?
          And that's really... and you know
          it's so sad to say this, but that's
          really how I've been living my
          whole life.

                         SAM
          Trying to barrel through.

                         LARGE
          Yeah.

          Thanks Mom.
          (beat, realizing)
          That's funny. The definition's
          always confused me, but I'm pretty
          sure that's irony.
          He smiles. He wipes his tears away with his own sleeve .

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          Come here.
          She comes in for a tight embrace. He kisses her gently on her
          cheek with his eyes closed, then rests his head on her
          - shoulder.

                         SAM
          How do you feel?
          On Large's face as he thinks about that question.

                         LARGE
          Safe.

                         (BEAT)
          When I'm with you, I feel so
          safe... like I'm Rome.
          A WIDE SHOT of the bathroom as Sam and Large embrace in the
          middle of the empty tub and the faucet continuee to DRIP.

          Large stands at the end of the bed staring at Gideon lying
          propped up with a book on his cheat, asleep. The EVENING NEWS
          is on the TV.

          reading.

                         LARGE
          I've been on a pretty crazy little

          I'm sure you can find plenty of
          things in your life to be angry
          about, but what I don't understand
          is why you're so angry at me. All I
          ever wanted was for everybody to be
          happy again, Andrew. That's all I
          ever wanted.

                         LARGE
          But when were we ever all happy,

          that you wish we could all get back
          to? 'Cause I don't have it in my

          Gideon doesn't hear the voice as he bends over and tries to
          pick each toenail he's cut out of the thick carpet.

          RYAN (O.S.)
          Thank you, Dan. Well I have some
          good news. We are in for some
          gorgeous weather coming our way out
          of the northwest.

                         FEMALE VOICE
          Gideon?
          A SCREAM and a BANG from the FEMALE VOICE in the other room!
          GIDEON'S FACE as it whips up into frame from his task on the
          floor.

          FEMALE VOICE (CONT'A)

          GIDEON!

          SHE SCREAMS AGAIN THROUGH WATER!
          He darts up off the floor and races to the open bathroom
          doorl He is about to enter and then he's STOPPED ABRUPTLY.

                         SARAH

                         GIDEON I
          SARAH IS DROWNING. Through the door we see SPLASHES OF WATER
          as they land on the bathroom floor.
          GIDEON'S FACE. he can't move; fro2en. His mind is racing;
          ADRENALINE. We can almost see how fast:his, mind is
          processing through his EYES.
          The WEATHER REPORT continues low in the background.

                         SARAH (CONT'D)

                         (THROUGH GASPS)

          GIDE...
          And then silence.
          GIDEON'S FACE; Wide-eyed in terror.
          HIS FINGERS as they slide down off the bathroom door frame.
          He backs away slowly to the bed and site down; staring
          blankly at the bathroom door. And then he starts to SOB.
          Quickly his whole body seems to surrender into it and he
          WEEPS hard. His whole back lurches upward with each SOH.

          RYAN (O.S.)
          So there you have it folks; get out
          the picnic baskets, push up those
          storm windows, 'cause it appears
          that Spring has arrived.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         117
          Gideon looks up; lost. His face is covered with tears. He
          reaches down to the phone and dials 911.

                         GIDEON
          I need an ambulance.

          BLACK.

          INT. AIRPORT BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA-- DAY

          Sam cries in a phone booth. A KNOCK on the glass spins her
          around to see Large. He opens the door.

                         SAM
          What are you doing?

                         LARGE
          Remember that idea I had about
          growing and working stuff out on my
          own and then finding you when I'd
          figured myself out?

                         SAM
          The ellipses?

                         LARGE
          Yeah the ellipses. Its dumb. It's
          an awful idea. And I'm not gonna do
          it. Because like you said, this is
          it. This is life. And I'm in love
          with you, Samantha.
          (with a laugh)
          I think that's the only thing I've
          .ever been really sure of in my
          whole life. I'm really fucked up
          right now, but I don't want to
          waste any more of my life without
          you in it. Okay?

                         SAM
          Yeah.

                         LARGE
          Because I think I can do this. I
          know I can. I want to. We have to.
          Yeah?
          Tears stream down her face. She smiles her angelic smile.

                         SAM

                         LARGE

                         SAM

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         118

                         LARGE
          Okay.
          (beat, nodding)
          What do we do?
          He looks at her and smiles like we've never seen him smile;

          ALIVE; AWAKE; CHARGED!

          LARGE (CONT - D)
          What do we do?

          They pause for a moment, staring at each other, transfixed by
          adrenaline and spontaneity. Slowly Large leans in and they
          kiss amidst an almost desolate baggage claim area.

               OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING

               We MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that 
               define and establish our setting, from commercial district 
               to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves 
               moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many 
               of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. 
               As we track past at window-level we see:

               A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER 
               runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..

               An empty room...

               A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, 
               watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed 
               potatoes with his fingers...

               A dazed old woman staring out the window.

               The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.

               We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the 
               THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production 
               number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of 
               clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted 
               back as she dances along to the video while trying on a 
               GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY.

               A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner 
               with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY

               A graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland 
               faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, 
               we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her 
               head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.

               She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is 
               also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an 
               elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.

                                     SPEAKER
                         High school is like the training 
                         wheels for the bicycle of real life.  
                         It is a time for young people to 
                         explore different fields of interest 
                         and to hopefully grow from their 
                         experiences.  After all, that which 
                         we learn from our mistakes can be as 
                         valuable as what we learn from our 
                         textbooks, and often we can turn the 
                         negative experiences that are common 
                         to all high-schoolers into positive 
                         steps toward personal growth and 
                         achievement. In coming to terms with 
                         my own personal setback, which I'm 
                         sure you've all heard about, I've 
                         been able to learn a lot about myself. 
                         I've learned for one thing that I 
                         don't need to rely on drugs and 
                         alcohol
                              (APPLAUSE)
                         and that I'm very lucky-that more 
                         people besides Carrie and myself 
                         weren't hurt in the accident; I've 
                         learned that I'm blessed with 
                         wonderful parents, teachers and above 
                         all the best classmates in the world -- 
                         I love each and every one of you 
                         guys!!
                              (APPLAUSE)
                         and I've learned that to get through 
                         life's obstacles you need faith, 
                         hope and, most of all, a sense of 
                         humor.
                              (BIG APPLAUSE)

               A trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black) 
               come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping. 
               The audience loves them.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATE AFTERNOON

               The auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid & Rebecca 
               run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up 
               diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly 
               bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.

               Enid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE 
               FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath.

                                     ENID
                         God, what a bunch of retards...

                         I thought Chipmunk-face was never 
                         going to shut up.

                                     ENID
                         I know, I liked her better when she 
                         was an alcoholic crack addict! She 
                         gets in one car wreck and all of a 
                         sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and 
                         everybody loves her.

                                     REBECCA
                         It's totally sickening.
                              (she unrolls her 
                              DIPLOMA)
                         Let's see if they gave me the right 
                         diploma...

               Enid opens hers. Instead of a diploma, it's an OFFICIAL 
               LOOKING DOCUMENT with a pink Post-It note on the front page.

                                     ENID
                         What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!

                         These assholes are saying that I 
                         have to go to Summer school and take 
                         some stupid art class!

                         Remember that stupid hippie art 
                         teacher who failed me sophomore year?  
                         I didn't think that just because you 
                         get an "F" that means you have to 
                         take the class over again.

                         This is so bad, it's almost good.

                                     ENID
                         This is so bad it's gone past good 
                         and back to bad again...

                         Just think, we'll never have to see 
                         any of these creepy faces ever again.

                                     ENID
                         Nothing.

                                     MELORRA
                         I'm going to be in this actor's 
                         workshop, and I'm hoping to start 
                         going on auditions soon. I'm so 
                         excited to finally have some free 
                         time. We have to get together this 
                         summer!

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...

                                     MELORRA
                              (spotting better people 
                              to talk to)
                         Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!

               Melorra leaves.

                                     ENID
                         Since when is she an "actress"?

                                     REBECCA
                         I know, she needs to die immediately.

               TODD, a friendly but slightly below-average-looking guy, 
               approaches from behind.

                                     TODD
                         Hey Rebecca!

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh... hi...

                                     TODD
                              (pause)
                         So... we finally --

                                     ENID
                         What about me? Am I not even here?

                                     TODD
                         Oh, hey Enid...
                              (starting over)
                         So... we finally made it!

                                     REBECCA
                         Yep.

                                     TODD
                              (awkward pause)
                         So... where are you going to college?

                                     ENID
                              (before Rebecca can 
                              answer)
                         We're not.

                                     TODD
                         Really? Both of you?... Why not?

                                     ENID
                         Just because.

                                     REBECCA
                         We have other plans.

                                     TODD
                         I guess I should have figured that 
                         you two would do something different.

                                     ENID
                         What are you going to be when you 
                         grow up, Todd?

                                     TODD
                         Well I'm going to major in Business 
                         Administration and, I think, minor 
                         in Communications.

                                     ENID
                         See, that's exactly the kind of thing 
                         we're trying to avoid.
                              (pause)

               Todd starts to talk again but Enid has noticed something off 
               to the side.

                                     TODD
                         So... I --

               Enid grabs Rebecca and turns her away from Todd before he 
               can finish his sentence.

                                     ENID
                         Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler 
                         going out with Rod Harbaugh?

                                     REBECCA
                         How perfect.

                                     ENID
                         He better watch out or he'll get 
                         AIDS when he date-rapes her.

               Todd, forgotten, walks away. The singer wails a sappy, maudlin 
               ballad. Enid spots DENNIS, the class loser, wandering around 
               by himself.

                                     ENID
                         God, just think, we'll never see 
                         Dennis again.

                                     REBECCA
                         Good.

                                     ENID
                         God, think about that... that's 
                         actually totally depressing.

               INT. THE QUALITY CAFE - DAY

               The QUALITY CAFE is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout. A 50-ISH 
               MAN with shaved head, and his VAGUELY DIABOLICAL WIFE sit 
               eating lunch. Enid is drawing a picture of them in her 
               sketchbook when Rebecca arrives.

                                     REBECCA
                         Hi.

                                     ENID
                         Look at these people behind you.  
                         I'm totally convinced they're 
                         Satanists.

                                     REBECCA
                         Why?

                                     ENID
                         Just look at them!

               REBECCA turns and makes eye contact with MR. SATANIST. She 
               calmly turns back to face Enid before cracking up.

                                     REBECCA
                         So, when are we going to start looking 
                         for our apartment?

                                     ENID
                         Soon... I have to wait and see how 
                         this Summer class goes.

                                     REBECCA
                         Did you sign up yet?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, I just picked the one that 
                         sounded the easiest.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, it's so weird that we're finally 
                         out of high school... We've been 
                         waiting for this our whole life! Now 
                         we can get our own apartment and do 
                         anything we want.  It's such a weird 
                         feeling.

                                     ENID
                         I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.

               Enter JOHN ELLIS, an obnoxious young man with a perpetual 
               smirk.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, 
                         the little Jewish girl and her Aryan 
                         friend.

                                     ENID
                         You're late, asshole.

                                     JOHN
                         Fine, and how are you?

                                     ENID
                         Did you bring that tape?

               He puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach.

                                     JOHN
                         You never paid me for that tape with 
                         the Indian dance routine.

                                     ENID
                         I did too!

                                     JOHN
                         Tsk! You Jews are so clever with 
                         money...

                                     ENID
                         Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!

                                     REBECCA
                         Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!

                                     ENID
                         We should follow them!

               As the SATANISTS walk outside, they open umbrellas, even 
               though it's a bright, sunny day.

                                     REBECCA
                         Totally... Oh my God, look!

               The girls get up to follow them. Enid grabs the videotape.

                                     ENID
                              (to John)
                         Thanks for the tape - I'll have to 
                         pay you later, I'm broke.

                                     JOHN
                         Hey, where are you going?

                                     ENID
                         Later, "Dude".

                                     REBECCA
                         Much later.

                                     ENID
                         In fact, never.

               EXT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY

               Under harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block 
               behind the SATANISTS.

                                     REBECCA
                         What do you do if you're a satanist, 
                         anyway?

                                     ENID
                         You know, sacrifice virgins and 
                         stuff...

                                     REBECCA
                         That lets us off the hook.

               EXT. ACROSS FROM WOWSVILLE - TEN MINUTES HAVE PASSED

               The SATANISTS continue slowly along with Enid & Rebecca still 
               following.

                                     ENID
                         Maybe there's some weird secret 
                         satanic society that meets at the 
                         Quality Cafe and all of the other 
                         regular customers are in on it except 
                         for us.

                                     REBECCA
                         Or maybe not.

                                     ENID
                         Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or 
                         they're planning to brainwash us and --

                                     REBECCA
                         Okay, okay!

               EXT. WOWSVILLE DINER - CONTINUOUS

                                     ENID
                         Hey, look at this...

               Enid points at the mini-mall in front of them. A new 
               restaurant - we see their banner: "GRAND OPENING. WOWSVILLE - 
               THE AUTHENTIC 50'S DINER".

                                     ENID
                         "Authentic 50's diner"? Since when 
                         were there mini-malls in the 1950's?

                                     REBECCA
                         God, it's so totally pathetic.

               INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - DAY

               They're in a booth looking at menus. It's a less accurate 
               version of "Johnny Rockets". A golden oldie from the 80's 
               plays on the jukebox.

                                     REBECCA
                         Who can forget this great hit from 
                         the 50's?

                                     ENID
                         I feel as though I've stepped into a 
                         time warp!

               The WAITER approaches. He has an ostentatious 70's-style 
               perm.

                                     REBECCA
                         Check out the awesome "fifties" hairdo 
                         on the waiter.

                                     WAITER
                         Hi, my name is Allen, and I'll be 
                         your waiter this afternoon.

                                     ENID
                         Hi, Al!

                                     REBECCA
                         Can we call you "Weird Al"?

                                     WAITER
                         Heh heh. Our specials today are pasta 
                         Vasilio, which is a pasta salad with 
                         a light basil vinaigrette--

                         That was a popular dish in the 50's, 
                         huh Weird Al?

                                     AL
                         I imagine so! Also, we have a spinach 
                         tortellini in a ricotta sauce. Both 
                         of those are $6.95... shall I give 
                         you a few minutes to mull it over?

                         I just want an order of onion rings.

                                     REBECCA
                         I might actually get the pasta 
                         special.

                                     ENID
                         You loser!

                                     AL
                         Pasta special and an order of onion 
                         rings. Very good.

               Al leaves.

                                     ENID
                         Did you notice all those weird things 
                         on the menu? Like "The Salad 
                         Explosion"?

                                     REBECCA
                         I know... and instead of "dessert" 
                         it says "Mindbenders."

                                     ENID
                         What does that even mean?

               INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - TEN MINUTES LATER

               Enid spots an abandoned newspaper, THE FREE WEEKLY, on the 
               adjoining table.

                                     REBECCA
                         Check out the Personals... maybe our 
                         future husbands are trying to contact 
                         us.

                         God, this paper is so boring. Who 
                         reads all this shit?
                              (flips through it 
                              until she gets to

                         You can have that one.

               Al returns with their food.

                                     AL
                         Can I get you ladies anything else, 
                         or are you all set?

                                     ENID
                         Later I might be interested in one 
                         of those far-out "mindbenders."

               Al leaves. Enid goes back to the paper.

                                     ENID
                         Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you 
                         remember me? Airport shuttle, June 
                         7th. You: striking redhead with yellow 
                         dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. 
                         I was the bookish fellow in the green 
                         cardigan who helped you find your 
                         contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we 
                         have a moment?"

                                     REBECCA
                         God, that's so pathetic. I bet she 
                         didn't even notice him.

                                     ENID
                         I know. And he's like psychotically 
                         obsessing over every little detail.

                                     REBECCA
                         We should call him and pretend to be 
                         the redhead.

                                     ENID
                         Oh, we totally have to.

               Enid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook.

               CU of sketchbook.

               INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

               Enid and Rebecca sit with Rebecca's grandmother OOMIE in her 
               living room. They eat TV dinners while watching Oomie's 
               favorite TV SHOW, which we hear but don't see.

                                     NASAL-VOICED GIRL (V.O.)
                         So what happened next, Donna?

                                     DONNA (DUMB BLONDE'S V.O.)
                         Then I told him he'd better take out 
                         his hose and pump me!

                                     NASAL-VOICED GIRL/ANOTHER GIRL (V.O.)
                         Don-na?!

                                     DONNA (V.O.)
                         You guys! My car was out of gas!

               LAUGH TRACK. Enid leans toward Rebecca.

                                     ENID
                              (whispers)
                         Does Oomie really like this show?

                              (whispers)
                         Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.

                                     OOMIE
                         Girls! Shh!

               Enid and Rebecca exit.

               INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING

               Rebecca looks through Enid's sketchbook while Enid fiddles 
               with the remote, fast-forwarding through a tape in the VCR.

                                     REBECCA
                         So what should we do?

                                     ENID
                         Wait... I just want to see what's on 
                         this tape.

                                     REBECCA
                         What is this?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno. John Ellis always puts on 
                         all this sick stuff that I have to 
                         fast-forward past to get to the good 
                         stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don 
                         Knotts movie on here someplace.

               Sound of FAST-FORWARDING. Rebecca glances up from the 
               sketchbook.

                                     REBECCA
                         Wait, what is that?

               Enid stops fast-forwarding. We don't see the screen but we 
               hear weird sounds like BOOTS WALKING THROUGH DEEP MUD.

                                     ENID & REBECCA
                         EEEEWWWW!

               Enid lurches forward to avert her gaze. She clicks off the 
               VCR, but leaves the TV on. She notices a PHOTO ALBUM on a 
               bookshelf under the television.

                                     ENID
                         Hey - why do you have this?

                                     REBECCA
                         You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

                                     ENID
                         I've been looking all over for this.

               ANGLE ON ALBUM as she leafs through it. We see a picture of 
               a FIVE-YEAR-OLD ENID with glasses.

                                     ENID
                         Look at how cute I am!

                                     REBECCA
                         What a little hosebag.

               ANGLE ON PHOTO of ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD ENID & REBECCA at a party.

                                     ENID
                         Look, that's back when I hated you.

                                     REBECCA
                         I remember every minute of that party.

                                     ENID
                              (another page)
                         There's my dad with Joanie.

                                     REBECCA
                         I can never keep them all straight - 
                         was she the super-bitch?

                                     ENID
                         No, she was the second wife. The 
                         third one was the super-bitch - 
                         Maxine.
                              (finds a picture)
                         There! Look at her!

               ANGLE ON PHOTO of MAXINE.

                                     ENID
                         What a fucking monster!

               Something on TV catches Rebecca's eye.

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my God! This is that comedian I 
                         was telling you about! You have to 
                         see this guy -- he's the absolute 
                         worst!

               A dead-pan comedian, JOEY McCOBB, is doing his stand-up 
               routine in a standard brick-wall comedy venue. He has a 
               contrived "I'm a weirdo" shtick.

                                     JOEY
                         Just because I live with my mother 
                         people think I'm peculiar... so what 
                         if she's been dead for fifteen years! 
                         Hehn hehn...
                              (Peter Lorre laugh)

                                     REBECCA (V.O.)
                         God, that's barely even a joke.

                                     JOEY
                         As I always say, take my life... 
                         please!

                                     ENID (V.O.)
                         If he's supposed to be so weird, how 
                         come he's wearing Nikes?

                                     ANNOUNCER

                                     ENID
                         Joey McCobb is our God.

                                     REBECCA
                         I want to do him!

                                     ENID
                         I bet! Actually he reminds me of 
                         that one creep you went out with -- 
                         you always go for guys with some 
                         lame, fake shtick.

                                     REBECCA
                         What are you talking about -- who?

                                     ENID
                         That Larry guy -- what look was he 
                         going for? A gay tennis player from 
                         the forties?

                                     REBECCA
                         Fuck you!

               Rebecca turns the page of Enid's sketchbook to the torn-out 
               personal ad.

                                     REBECCA
                         Hey! We forgot to call the loser!

                                     ENID
                         Which loser?

                                     REBECCA
                         You know, the green cardigan guy.

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah.

               Rebecca goes to the phone and offers the receiver.

                                     REBECCA
                         You call.

                                     ENID
                         Why do I always have to do it?

                                     REBECCA
                         You're better at it.

                                     ENID
                              (as she dials)
                         I remember when I first started 
                         reading these I thought DWF stood 
                         for "dwarf!"

                                     REBECCA
                              (ear up to phone)
                         What does it stand for?

                                     ENID
                         Shh, it's his answering machine...
                              (pause)
                         We hear the indistinct traces of a 
                         musical message followed by a faint 
                         BEEP.

                                     ENID
                         Hi, it's me - your "striking blonde." 
                         Of course I remember you.  Let's get 
                         together for lunch sometime... How 
                         about Friday at one o'clock?... Why 
                         don't you meet me at my favorite 
                         restaurant, "Wowsville"... It's in 
                         the mall on Century Parkway... I'll 
                         see you there, darling... and be 
                         sure to wear that sexy green 
                         cardigan...

               As Enid hangs up they both start laughing.

               EXT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

               A franchise convenience store with a western motif.

               INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

               JOSH, 19, is taking his apron off as his BOSS, a humorless 
               Greek immigrant, counts out the cash register. Cheerful Muzak 
               plays.

                                     BOSS
                         AH AH AH! What you think you doing?  
                         You still got five minutes left on 
                         you shift!

               Enid (wearing wraparound shades) & Rebecca enter.

                                     ENID
                         Well hello there, young employee of 
                         the Sidewinder.

                                     JOSH
                         Look, I already told you I'm not 
                         going to give you a ride.

                                     ENID
                         What can you tell me, young man, 
                         about the various flavors of "frozen 
                         yogurt"?

                                     JOSH
                         Look, I'll be done in a minute.  
                         Just wait outside.

                                     ENID
                         I'm afraid I don't understand. I 
                         simply wish to know --

                                     BOSS
                         JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?

                                     JOSH
                              (SIGHS)
                         The flavors we're featuring this 
                         week, in addition to old favorites 
                         chocolate and vanilla, are Six-Gun 
                         Strawberry, Wild Cherry Round-up, 
                         and Ten Gallon Tangerine.

                                     ENID
                         I don't believe I care for any of 
                         those.

               Rebecca giggles. A customer, DOUG, enters: a lowly specimen 
               with bad hair-cut, mustache, and jail-house tattoos, wearing 
               filthy designer jeans and no shirt.

                                     DOUG
                         Hey, Josh... I need two packs of 
                         smokes. I'm on a double shift 
                         tonight... fuckin' sixteen hours, 
                         man.

               Doug brings a 40-ouncer to the counter. Josh has two packs 
               of Newports waiting for him.

                                     DOUG
                         Hey, and gimme six of these beef 
                         jerkys too - I'm hungry enough to 
                         chew the crotch out of a rag doll!

               Doug pays.

                                     BOSS
                         Hey! I told you: No shirt, no service!

                                     DOUG
                              (as he leaves)
                         Fuck you, man!

                                     ENID
                         So Josh...

                                     JOSH
                         Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm 
                         almost done.

               Enid looks at herself in the security mirror. She takes off 
               her hat and messes up her hair. She then takes off her shades 
               and replaces them with her standard horn-rims.

                                     REBECCA
                              (nudging Enid, points 
                              outside)
                         Look at this!

               Outside we see Doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a 
               beer. Heavy metal music blares from his car radio. The BOSS 
               sees this and goes out to yell at him.

                                     BOSS
                         You get out of here!

               Josh joins Enid & Rebecca on the other side of counter.

                                     ENID
                         That guy rules!

                                     JOSH
                         Who, Doug? He spends more time here 
                         than I do...

                                     ENID
                         So Josh, will you give us a ride?  
                         Please? Pretty please? It's going to 
                         be super fun!

                                     JOSH
                         No.

                                     REBECCA
                         Please Josh?

                                     JOSH
                         Forget it, there's no way... find 
                         some other poor sucker to abuse.

               EXT. JOSH'S CAR - DAY

               Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing 
               in the back seat.

                                     JOSH
                         Why do you even need a ride? You 
                         could walk there in two minutes.

                                     ENID
                         It's just an excuse for us to spend 
                         time with you.

               Enid and Rebecca giggle.

                                     REBECCA
                         So Josh, if this guy freaks out, 
                         will you protect us?

                                     JOSH
                         He has every reason to freak out -- 
                         this is a totally fucked-up thing to 
                         do to somebody!

                                     ENID
                         God, I think Josh is too mature for 
                         us.

                                     REBECCA
                         I know, look at the way he drives... 
                         he's like an old man.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!

               EXT. GAFFEY STREET - DAY

               Their car accelerates.

               INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - 12:35 PM.

               The three of them are seated at a corner booth. A song from 
               any decade other than the 50's PLAYS on the jukebox. A 
               BUSINESSMAN enters.

                                     REBECCA
                         Look, maybe that's him!

                                     ENID
                         It's still twenty-five minutes early.

                                     JOSH
                         Aren't there a million places like 
                         this?

                                     ENID
                         This is the ultimate. It's like the 
                         Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.

                                     JOSH
                         So, where's "Weird Al"?

                                     ENID
                         SHH! He's back there. I can see his 
                         hair bobbing up and down.

                                     REBECCA
                         I want to "make love" to him.

                                     ENID
                         I'm going to tell him you said that.

               WEIRD AL approaches with menus.

                                     AL
                         So nice to see you again, ladies.

                                     ENID
                         Hey, Weird Al, there's something my 
                         friend wants to tell you --

                                     REBECCA
                         SHUT UP!

                                     ENID
                         She says she wants to MMPH!

               Rebecca puts her hand over Enid's mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PUSH SWEEPER, SWEEPING THE CARPET.

               ANGLE ON: OLD WOMAN slowly sweeping.

               WE FOLLOW HER BACK TO: Enid, Rebecca & Josh. They're now 
               eating: ten minutes have passed, it's 12:45.

                                     ENID
                         So Josh... Becky and I are trying to 
                         figure out what makes you tick.  
                         Tell us about your political beliefs.

               REBECCA laughs.

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, right.

                                     ENID
                         No, I'm serious. Give us your whole 
                         basic philosophy in a nutshell.

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my God, look, that's got to be 
                         him!

               A GUY enters.

                                     ENID
                         Is he wearing a green cardigan?

                                     REBECCA
                         What exactly is a cardigan anyway?

               The GUY joins a friend.

                                     ENID
                         That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking 
                         me out.

                                     JOSH
                         In answer to your question, I suppose 
                         I endorse policies that are opposed 
                         to stupidity and violence and cruelty 
                         in any form...

                                     ENID
                         I figured something like that...

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my God!

               They see a somewhat funny-looking guy in his late 30's, 
               wearing a green cardigan, SEYMOUR, enter. Enid and Rebecca 
               hunch down in their seats.

                                     ENID
                         It's obviously him!

                                     REBECCA
                         I can't believe it!

               Seymour sits down and looks around. Weird Al brings a menu.

               ANOTHER ANGLE ON: WEIRD AL bringing his milkshake. Ten more 
               minutes have passed, it's 12:55.

                                     REBECCA
                         What's going on now? What's he doing?

                                     ENID
                         Oh my god, he just ordered a giant 
                         glass of milk!

                                     JOSH
                              (bursting her bubble)
                         It's a vanilla milkshake.

               Fifteen more minutes have passed - it's 1:10 PM. Seymour 
               looks around, still hopeful. His date is now TEN MINUTES 
               LATE.

                                     REBECCA
                         What's he doing now?

                                     ENID
                         He's still just sitting there. God, 
                         this is totally unbearable!

                                     JOSH
                         I agree.

                                     REBECCA
                         I wish I could see him.

                                     ENID
                         Go ahead and look, but don't make it 
                         too obvious...

               Rebecca turns around and pretends to look past Seymour.

               It's now 1:30 PM. His date is 30 MINUTES LATE. Seymour gets 
               up and walks sadly towards the cashier (Weird Al).

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you think he knows?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno...

               They watch him leave. Enid goes up to pay the bill while 
               Josh and Rebecca go outside.

                                     ENID
                         Hey Weird Al, did that guy say 
                         anything to you before he left?

                                     AL
                         Not a thing.

               Enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars. Al 
               passes behind her.

                                     AL
                              (cheerfully 
                              professional despite 
                              her abuse)
                         Thank you and come again.

               Enid hesitates, overcome with guilt. She glances back at Al, 
               then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars 
               in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip.

               EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

               The trio drive in silence. Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up 
               vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver (SEYMOUR) next to 
               him. SEYMOUR bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities.

                                     JOSH
                         Jesus, look at this guy.

                                     ENID
                         Oh my God, that's HIM!

                                     REBECCA
                         Are you sure?

                                     ENID
                         Totally! Look!

               ANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of 
               his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face.

                                     ENID
                         He's insane!

                                     REBECCA
                         We should follow him home.

                                     JOSH
                         Forget it.

                                     ENID
                         Come on, Josh... don't you want to 
                         see where he lives?

                                     JOSH
                         No.

                                     ENID
                         But this guy is like a one-of-kind, 
                         rare butterfly, and we have to follow 
                         him back to his natural habitat...

                                     JOSH
                         You need counseling.

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Several minutes have passed. Seymour parks.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, he lives right in our 
                         neighborhood!

               Seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building.

                                     ENID
                         He doesn't even look that bummed 
                         out, really.

                                     REBECCA
                         I know... wouldn't you be totally 
                         pissed off?

                                     ENID
                         This kind of thing must happen to 
                         him all the time.

               INT. EXPERIMENTAL FILM - DAY

               FULL SCREEN: grainy B&W video footage. The CAMERA travels up 
               a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic 
               POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR ("LALALALALALA").

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                              (cheap echo effect)
                         Returning to the house of my 
                         Fatherfatherfatherfather...

               The CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that 
               slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's 
               decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We 
               HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little 
               girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll 
               and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now 
               mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around.

               We see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily 
               picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END.  A 
               FILM BY ROBERTA ALLSWORTH.

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               The lights go on, the VIDEO ends and the monitor is shut 
               off.

               There are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old 
               boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl 
               outfit. The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That piece is entitled 
                         "Mirror/Father/Mirror." I like to 
                         show it to people I'm meeting for 
                         the first time because it says so 
                         much about who I am and what it feels 
                         like to inhabit my specific skin.  
                         And this is exactly what I'm hoping 
                         to get from each of you over the 
                         course of this Summer: a picture of 
                         your own self-exploration. My own 
                         background is in video and performance 
                         art, but I'm hoping that doesn't 
                         influence you and that you'll find 
                         your own ways of externalizing the 
                         internal. At the end of the Summer, 
                         this class has been invited, along 
                         with several others in the area, to 
                         participate in a show of High-School 
                         art at the Neighborhood Activity 
                         Center. The title of the show will 
                         be "Brotherhood and Community: Art 
                         as Dialogue." I think the 
                         "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely 
                         with the theme of self-discovery 
                         that I'd like to emphasize in this 
                         class. Are there any questions so 
                         far?
                              (she's completely 
                              lost them)
                         Great...

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               Enid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment.

                                     ENID
                         This is way too creepy.

                                     REBECCA
                         He won't see us... we'll just stalk 
                         him from a distance.

                                     ENID
                         I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start 
                         feeling really bad again.

               A pause.

                                     ENID
                         So what should we do? We can't just 
                         hide all day waiting for him to come 
                         out...

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S BUILDING - MAILBOX

               There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the 
               first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME 
               JOURNAL.

                                     ENID
                         This is girl mail.

               She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO.

                                     ENID
                         This is all computer catalogues and 
                         stuff...

               Rebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE.

                                     REBECCA
                         The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...
                              (she flips through 
                              the mail)
                         Oh my God, The National Psoriasis 
                         Foundation!

                                     ENID
                         Bingo!

               She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs 
               the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner.

                                     REBECCA
                         Wait! Do you hear that?

               Enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic.

                                     ENID
                         Shit!

               They slowly walk around the bushes toward the voices.

               INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

               They see the GARAGE SALE, in progress. They've all spotted 
               each other.

                                     REBECCA
                         What should we do? What if he 
                         recognizes us?

                                     ENID
                         Come on, it's too late now...

               A middle-aged HOUSEWIFE browses with little enthusiasm as 
               Enid & Rebecca tentatively approach. Enid spots a MONGOOSE 
               VS. COBRA taxidermy piece near Joe...

                                     ENID
                         Ew, look at this...

                                     REBECCA
                         Gross!

                                     ENID
                         I think it's cute - look at his little 
                         weasel teeth.

                                     REBECCA
                         Ew, it's like some gross rat...

                                     JOE
                              (hardly looking up 
                              from TV)
                         It's a mongoose.

                                     REBECCA
                         Mm...

                                     ENID
                         A what?

                                     JOE
                         A mongoose... they eat snakes... you 
                         never heard of a mongoose?  That's a 
                         classic piece of vintage taxidermy. 
                         Nobody alive today knows how to do 
                         work like that.

                                     ENID
                              (looking underneath 
                              it)
                         How much is this?

                                     JOE
                         Umm... That's not officially for 
                         sale... I might have to hang onto 
                         that for the time being.

               Joe shuts off the TV. He turns to the girls, not wanting to 
               lose the rapport he's established with two potential 
               customers.

                                     JOE
                         So, are you looking for anything in 
                         particular? There's a lot of other 
                         stuff in storage...

               He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's 
               toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks.

                                     JOE
                         Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to 
                         you.  Absolutely no practice 
                         necessary.  You shread like a giant. 
                         Just press a button.

                                     ENID
                         That's okay...

               She notices several modern jazz LPs on Joe's table.

                                     ENID
                         Do you have any other old records 
                         besides these?

                                     JOE
                         Seymour does.

                                     ENID
                         Who does?

                                     JOE
                         Him. Seymour. He's the man with the 
                         records.

               Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name: 
               "Seymour?!" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter, 
               and turns away from the table. Enid keeps her cool...

                                     ENID
                         Do you have any old Indian records?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Indian records?

                                     ENID
                         You know, like weird 1960's Indian 
                         rock n' roll music.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't have anything after about 
                         1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from 
                         the twenties in my collection, but 
                         it's not really for sale. I don't 
                         really collect "foreign."

               Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Those are all 78s... Can you play 
                         78s?

                                     ENID
                         Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I 
                         can play regular records...

               He points her to a nearby box of LPs.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         There's some good stuff in here... 
                         do you like old music?

                                     ENID
                         Sure, I guess.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well there's a few choice LPs in 
                         here that re-issue some really great 
                         old blues stuff.

               Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve. Enid gets free and continues 
               looking through the records. She stops on one with an 
               especially wacky cover.

                                     ENID
                         Is this one any good?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Nah, it's not so great. Here's the 
                         one I'd recommend.

               He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, 
               VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         This track alone by Memphis Minnie 
                         is worth about $500 if you have the 
                         original 78. She was one of the 
                         greatest guitar players that ever 
                         lived, and a great singer and 
                         songwriter as well. I know the guy 
                         who owns the original and lent it 
                         for use on this reissue.

                                     ENID
                         Wow!

               Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her.

                                     ENID
                         How much is it?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         A dollar seventy-five.

                                     ENID
                         Okay.

               She pays him.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         If you don't like it bring it back 
                         for a refund. We're here every 
                         Saturday.

               He puts the record into a bag.

                                     ENID
                         I'm sure it's fine.

               INT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca sit in their usual booth. Rebecca is reading 
               THE FREE WEEKLY.

                                     REBECCA
                         That was truly pathetic.

                                     ENID
                         I know... I still can't get over 
                         that his name was "Seymour."

               Rebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS. She 
               takes a pen out of her purse.

                                     REBECCA
                         He was so excited when you bought 
                         that record -- you're a saint!...  
                         God, these apartments are super 
                         expensive...

                                     ENID
                         It was so cute how he had his own 
                         little bags. I thought I was going 
                         to start crying!... Do you think 
                         they're gay?

                                     REBECCA
                         What about the "striking redhead in 
                         the yellow dress"?

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah...

                                     REBECCA
                         He should totally just kill himself... 
                         Hey, here's one
                              (circles it)
                         ...Oh wait...
                              (crosses it out)
                         you have to share it with a non 
                         smoking feminist and her two cats...

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... I kind of like him...  
                         He's the exact opposite of everything 
                         I really hate... In a way he's such 
                         a clueless dork that he's almost 
                         cool...

                                     REBECCA
                         That guy is many things but he 
                         definitely isn't "cool"... This one 
                         would be okay, but there's no 
                         kitchen...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but... you know what I mean.

                                     REBECCA
                         Not really...

                                     ENID
                         Forget it, I can't explain it...

               Awkward silence. Melorra enters.

                                     MELORRA
                         Oh my god, what are you guys doing 
                         here?

                                     ENID
                         What are you doing here, Melorra?

                                     MELORRA
                         My acting workshop is across the 
                         street from here. I'm just on my 
                         break.

                                     ENID
                         Well, we won't keep you.

                                     MELORRA
                         I love this place... it's so - you 
                         know, "funky."

               Enid and Rebecca look at each other.

                                     MELORRA
                         What are you guys up to?

                                     REBECCA
                         We're looking for an apartment.

                                     MELORRA
                         God how cool. Where are you moving?

                                     ENID
                         We're not sure yet, that's why we're 
                         looking.

                                     REBECCA
                         Somewhere downtown.

                                     MELORRA
                         God that's so exciting!
                              (looks at clock)
                         Oops, I should go. Bye you guys!  
                         Call me.

               Melorra leaves quickly.

                                     REBECCA
                         "Funky"?

                                     ENID
                         What, is she black now?

               They watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive 
               "casual" clothes with a fancy backpack.

                                     REBECCA
                         I've been thinking about when we 
                         look for our apartment how we have 
                         to try and convince people that we're 
                         like these totally rich yuppies...

                                     ENID
                         What are you talking about?

                                     REBECCA
                         That's who people want to rent to.  
                         It's a known fact that it's way easier 
                         to get a job and everything if you're 
                         rich... All we have to do is buy a 
                         few semi-expensive outfits and act 
                         like it's no big deal... it'll be 
                         fun.

                                     ENID
                         You just want an excuse to dress 
                         like some stupid fashion model without 
                         me making fun of you.

                                     REBECCA
                         Just promise you'll do it.

                                     ENID
                         Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're 
                         out of your mind.

               INT. ENID'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Loud water running; PUNK ROCK blares from adjoining bedroom 
               as Enid, her head in the sink, sings along, making up her 
               own words. As she straightens INTO FRAME, we see that she's 
               dyed her hair green. She grabs a towel and heads into the 
               bedroom.

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Her DAD enters with a mixing bowl, oblivious to the green 
               hair and loud music.

                                     DAD
                              (over music)
                         Have you seen my blue spatula?

                                     ENID
                         Nope. What are you making, pancakes?

                                     DAD
                         Not if I don't find that goddamn 
                         spatula.

               Dad leaves. Enid messes up her hair in different ways while 
               singing along to the tape and looking at herself in the 
               mirror. Rebecca opens the door and stands in the doorway.

                                     REBECCA
                              (disdainful)
                         When did you do that?

               Enid turns around, startled, but instantly regains helps 
               composure.

                                     ENID
                         What? How long have you been standing 
                         there?

               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/NEAR ACME SHOES - DAY

                                     REBECCA
                         Did you have to buy new hair dye or 
                         did you still have some left over 
                         from eighth grade?

                                     ENID
                         Fuck you, bitch!

               They walk past a sad-looking ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE, in 
               a distinctive old building, that looks as if it's been there 
               forever. They stop and peer through the window.

                                     ENID
                         We still have to go in there sometime.

                                     REBECCA
                         It's always closed...

                                     ENID
                         I bet they have tons of incredible 
                         shoes hidden in the back.

               They continue walking.

                                     ENID
                         Hey look, it's the pants.

               We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk.

                                     REBECCA
                         Where are we going?

                                     ENID
                         Let's go hassle Josh.

                         "Hassle"?

               They see a MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in a shabby threadbare 
               suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop. The rusty 
               sign has a red sticker on it that says "No longer in service."

                                     REBECCA
                         There he is...

                                     ENID
                         As always.

                                     REBECCA
                         Waiting for the bus that never 
                         comes...

                                     ENID
                         I wonder if he's just totally insane 
                         and he really thinks a bus is coming 
                         or --

                                     REBECCA
                         Why don't you ask him.

               Enid sits next to THE MAN. Rebecca stands behind the bench, 
               taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing 
               speculation.

                                     ENID
                         Hi... what's your name?

                                     MAN
                              (looks at watchless 
                              wrist, then down the 
                              street)
                         Norman.

                                     ENID
                         ...are you waiting for a bus?

                                     MAN
                         Yes.

                                     ENID
                         I hate to tell you this but they 
                         cancelled this bus line two years 
                         ago... There are no buses on this 
                         street.

                                     MAN
                         You don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

               EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second 
               floor of Josh's building. Enid POUNDS on his pasteboard door; 
               the windows RATTLE with each hollow THUD.

                                     ENID
                         JOSH!

                                     REBECCA
                         JOSH!

                                     ENID & REBECCA
                         JOSH!

                                     ENID
                         He's probably in there jerking off.

                                     REBECCA
                         I'll bet he never jerks off...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like 
                         that.

                                     REBECCA
                         Should we leave a note?

               Enid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer.

                                     ENID
                         Do you have a pen?

               She writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder. "Dear 
               Josh. We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door.  
               Therefore you are gay. Signed, Tiffany and Amber."

                                     REBECCA
                         You're not really going to leave 
                         that are you?

               Enid pushes the note over his doorknob.

               EXT. ENTERING ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY

                                     REBECCA
                         Why are we going here? I hate this 
                         place.

                                     ENID
                         It'll only take a second.

               INT. ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY

               They enter. We see racks of books-with titles like "Make 
               Explosives At Home." Rebecca walks over to the magazine rack.

                         Yeah, nice outfit - who are you 
                         supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper?

                                     ENID
                         Blow me, doofus!

               John Ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box 
               of books onto the shelves. He stops and looks at Enid.

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Didn't they tell you?

                                     ENID
                         Tell me what?

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Punk rock is over!

                                     ENID
                         I know it's over, asshole, I --

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         If you really want to "fuck up the 
                         system" - you should go to business 
                         school -- that's what I'm gonna do: 
                         get a job at some big corporation 
                         and fuck things up from the inside!

                                     ENID
                         That's not even --

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?

               She wads up a twenty-dollar bill and throws it at him.

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Oh, how "punk."

                                     ENID
                         That tape sucked, by the way!

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         I'm so sorry if you were offended!

               He heads toward the back room with the empty box.

                                     ENID
                         Go die, asshole!

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Get a job!

               He exits. Rebecca walks over to Enid.

                                     REBECCA
                         What was that all about?

                                     ENID
                         It's not like I'm some modern Punk 
                         dickhead... It's obviously supposed 
                         to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess 
                         Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get 
                         it!

                                     REBECCA
                         I didn't get it either.

                                     ENID
                         Everybody's too stupid!

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - EVENING

               Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom.  
               She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box 
               (black hair dye). She wets her hair, then goes into the 
               bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk 
               rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and 
               flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs, 
               dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.

               She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is 
               an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.

               Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and 
               we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting 
               old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The song continues. Enid sits in her bean-bag chair. Her 
               hair is now dyed back to black. As the song ends, she picks 
               up the needle and starts it again.

               INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, it took a while before I got a 
                         chance to play it, but when I heard 
                         that song it was like --

                                     SEYMOUR
                         So you really liked it? Yeah, there's 
                         some really rare performances. You 
                         liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, that's good too... the whole 
                         record was good, but that one song, 
                         "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly 
                         just keep playing that one over and 
                         over... Do you have any other records 
                         like that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         The Skip James record? Yeah, that's 
                         a masterpiece. There are no other 
                         records like that! I actually have 
                         the original 78 of it in my 
                         collection. It's one of maybe five 
                         known copies.

                                     ENID
                              (nearly sincere)
                         Wow!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Do you want to see it? I can run 
                         upstairs and get it...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, sure, I guess...

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (to Joe, he always 
                              says this when he 
                              leaves his table)
                         Watch my stuff.

               Seymour exits. An uncomfortable pause as Enid stands at the 
               table. She touches the mongoose's tooth.

                                     JOE
                              (not looking up)
                         You still interested in that?

                                     ENID
                         I thought it wasn't for sale.

                                     JOE
                         I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it 
                         go...

                                     ENID
                         It's kind of falling apart.

               Seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious 
               object.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Here it is. It's only about V minus 
                         and has an incipient lam crack, but 
                         plays decent as I recall.

               Seymour passes the 78 to Enid who follows suit and holds it 
               carefully by the edges.

                                     ENID
                         Wow...

               Enid pretends to drop the record.

                                     ENID
                         Oops! I dropped it!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         NO!!!

                                     ENID
                         Hey, I was only kidding!

               She hands the record back to Seymour, who's shaken and 
               embarrassed.

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, Seymour... are you all right?

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               Starts with a PAN ACROSS a wall of unimpressive high school 
               art: dumb drawings of fighting Chuck Norris-types, traced 
               centerfolds, highly sexualized horses, etc. And, on a table, 
               a wire sculpture made from two coathangers.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm not going to start a discourse 
                         on the subject of "good" art vs. 
                         "bad" art; these judgments are for 
                         each person to make on his own. I 
                         merely want to help each of you find 
                         the best way to look within yourselves 
                         the best key to your particular lock. 
                         Last week I asked you to-try and 
                         create a piece of artwork that 
                         responds to something that you have 
                         strong feelings about.

               Enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And it looks like we have some really 
                         interesting work up here....

               Roberta peruses some of the art, then points to a very violent 
               drawing.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What can you tell, us about your 
                         piece... uh...
                              (struggles to read 
                              signature)
                         ...Phillip?

                                     PHILLIP
                              (very stupid and 
                              nervous)
                         Uh... it's uh... it's about The 
                         Mutilator...

                                     ROBERTA
                         My goodness!

                                     PHILLIP
                         It's this really great video game 
                         about a guy who kills people with a 
                         big hammer...

                                     ROBERTA
                              (trying to make a 
                              joke)
                         I thought maybe this was supposed to 
                         be your father.

               No response from Phillip. Roberta nicks up Enid's sketchbook 
               and leafs through it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And what can you tell us about this...
                              (searches for name)

                                     ENID
                         Enid. It's sort of like a diary I 
                         guess.

               We see several sketches, including the drawing of the 
               SATANISTS. Roberta shows a few pages to the class.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think that Phillip and Enid can 
                         help us to see that there are-many 
                         different ways we can express 
                         ourselves.  We can do things like 
                         these cartoons that are amusing as a 
                         sort of light entertainment or we 
                         can do work that is more serious in 
                         scope and feeling and that deals 
                         with issues; emotional, spiritual, 
                         political; of great importance. I 
                         hope that you will each have the 
                         tools to do that type of work by the 
                         end of this class.

                              WIRE SCULPTURE)
                         Who is responsible for this?

                                     MARGARET
                         I am.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Talk to us about it...

                                     MARGARET
                         It's my response to the issue of a 
                         woman's right to choose... it's 
                         something I feel super-strongly about.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? 
                         This definitely falls into that higher 
                         category of art I was speaking of 
                         earlier.

               MARGARET glances over at Enid. Enid gives her a dirty look.

               On a monitor, a generic trailer is playing.

                         Hello and welcome to Masterpiece 
                         video. How may I help you this 
                         afternoon, sir?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         I'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2.

                         Yessir! Is it a new release, sir?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         No, it's the classic Italian film.

                                     MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
                         Let me look that up on the computer 
                         for you, sir!

                                     (FIDDLES WITH COMPUTER)
                         Yes, here it is - 9 1/2 WEEKS with 
                         Mickey Rourke. It's in our "Erotic 
                         Dramas" section.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         No, not "9 1/2", 8 1/2 , the Fellini 
                         film.

                                     MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
                         I'll check that for you sir. How do 
                         you spell the actor's name - F-I-L-E-
                         E-P-E-E...?

               WE SEE Enid & Rebecca, dressed up in sexy outfits.

                         How about this one?

                                     ENID
                         Hey, you have to see my new good 
                         luck charm.

               She pulls out a small porcelain figure of a MAN FLUSHING 
               HIMSELF DOWN A TOILET with the words "Goodbye Cruel World" 
               on the base.

                                     REBECCA
                         Ew ... when did you get that?

                                     ENID
                         This morning at Seymour's garage 
                         sale.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, aren't you tired of Seymour 
                         yet?

               Rebecca picks up another tape.

                                     REBECCA
                         How about this?

                                     ENID
                         Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All 
                         these movies suck.

               An obnoxious SIX-YEAR-OLD tries to get his PARENTS to add 
               another tape to their already tall stack. He stares at the 
               video monitor.

               Another MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE reshelves videos near them.

                         Hello! How are you young ladies this 
                         evening? May I help you find a 
                         particular Masterpiece movie?

                                     ENID
                         No.

               They walk by him.

                                     ENID
                         Let's get out of here, this place 
                         makes me sick.

                                     REBECCA
                         We have to do something fun tonight 
                         this is my last weekend of freedom 
                         before I start my stupid job.

                                     ENID
                         I know a party we could go to...

                                     REBECCA
                         What? Where?!

                                     ENID
                         It's a surprise.

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't believe you.

                                     ENID
                         If I promise you there's really a 
                         party with a lot of guys, do you 
                         promise you'll go?

               INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

               A depressing COLLECTORS' GET-TOGETHER in progress. Enid & 
               Rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner. Nine or ten RECORD 
               COLLECTORS mill about.

                                     JEROME
                         There are some records I will pay 
                         serious money for, provided they're 
                         a sincere V plus. Other than that 
                         I'd prefer to just have them on CD.

                                     STEVEN
                         CDs will never have the presence of 
                         an original 78.

                                     JEROME
                         WRR-ONG! A digital transfer adequately 
                         mastered will sound identical to the 
                         original. Do you have a decent 
                         equalizer?

                                     STEVEN
                         I have a Klipsch 2B3.

                                     JEROME
                         Obviously the problem! You expect a 
                         ten-band equalizer to impart state 
                         of-the-art sound? Dream a little 
                         dream! etc...

               Enid & Rebecca are sitting nearby.

                                     REBECCA
                         I totally, totally hate you.

                                     ENID
                         Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.

               ANGLE ON: Joe stands talking to GERROLD, an obnoxious, pushy, 
               fast-talking guy who keeps eyeing Rebecca. He shovels food 
               into his mouth as he speaks.

                                     GERROLD
                         So what's the story with the two 
                         cheerleaders over here?

                                     JOE
                         They're Seymour's.

                                     GERROLD
                         Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!

                                     JOE
                         Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' 
                         any and neither are you.

                                     GERROLD
                              (poking Joe in the 
                              chest)
                         Let me tell ya somethin', Joe...  
                         Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a 
                         home run without swinging the bat!

                                     JOE
                         Right.

               Gerrold walks over to where Rebecca is sitting. He sits on 
               the arm of sofa next to her.

                                     GERROLD
                         Mind if I sit here?

                                     REBECCA
                              (staring straight 
                              ahead)
                         Yes.

                                     GERROLD
                         Whoa, that was cold! Hey, you're 
                         okay, you're pretty sharp. So uh... 
                         hey, you're wearing a green dress - 
                         whadda you Irish? I bet you're Irish. 
                         What's your name?

                                     REBECCA
                         Melorra...

                                     GERROLD
                         Melorra, listen to me - let me tell 
                         you something Melorra... you seem 
                         like an interesting chick - what are 
                         you doing hanging out with these 
                         losers here? Whaddya say you and me 
                         take off and hit some nightspots 
                         etc. etc.

                         I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get 
                         a beer.

                         Wait...

               Enid goes over to the beer keg. Nearby Seymour stands talking 
               to PAUL - a humorless, middle-aged guy in a suit and tie 
               who's contemptuously examining one of Seymour's 78s.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...but it plays like new. There's no 
                         groove wear.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh please... It has an enlarged center 
                         hole and a hair crack.

               Enid approaches them.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         But the crack is so tight it's 
                         completely inaudible.

                                     PAUL
                         A tight hair crack is just that - a 
                         crack. I don't collect cracked 
                         records.
                              (walking away)
                         I only pay a premium for mint records 
                         Seymour, you know that!  Please!

                                     ENID
                         What was all that stuff about enlarged 
                         holes and tight cracks?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I didn't think you would have 
                         any interest in this get together... 
                         I mean if you had told me you were 
                         coming I would have warned you -- 
                         it's not like a real party or 
                         anything.

                                     ENID
                         You're right about that.
                              (pause)
                         So this is your record collection?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh God no. This is just junk I have 
                         for sale or trade. The record room 
                         is off-limits.

                                     ENID
                         Really? Can I see it?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well sure... you can if you 
                         want to... it's just I don't want 
                         all these guys in there at once... 
                         you know...

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               Enid & Seymour enter his inner sanctum, beverage containers 
               in hand -- nicely-displayed old collectibles cover just about 
               every inch of wall space.

                                     ENID
                         Wow! This is like my dream room!  
                         Are these all records!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I have about fifteen hundred 78s at 
                         this point. I've tried to pare down 
                         my collection to the essential...

                                     ENID
                         God, look at this poster!  I can't 
                         believe this room! You're the luckiest 
                         guy in the world! I'd kill to have 
                         stuff like this!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Please... go ahead and kill me!  
                         This stuff doesn't make you happy, 
                         believe me.

                                     ENID
                         Oh, come on! What are you talking 
                         about?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You think it's healthy to obsessively 
                         collect things? You can't connect 
                         with other people so you fill your 
                         life with stuff...  I'm just like 
                         all the rest of these pathetic 
                         collector losers.

               Enid writes her name in the dust.

                                     ENID
                         No you're not! You're a cool guy, 
                         Seymour.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why 
                         haven't I had a girlfriend in four 
                         years? I can't even remember the 
                         last time a girl talked to me.

                                     ENID
                         I'm talking to you... I'll bet there 
                         are tons of women who would go out 
                         with you in a minute!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh, right...

                                     ENID
                         No really... I guarantee I could get 
                         you a date in like two seconds...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Good luck...

                                     ENID
                         I'm totally serious!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well...

                                     ENID
                         I mean it -- You leave everything to 
                         me -- I'm going to be your own 
                         personal dating service!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I appreciate the offer but you really 
                         don't --

                                     ENID
                         Mark my words, by the end of this 
                         summer you'll be up to your neck in 
                         pussy!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid 
                         but I - I really --

               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

               As Enid and Seymour walk. A 20-ish secretary-type passes.

                                     ENID
                         What about her? Would you go out 
                         with her?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't know, what kind of question 
                         is that? I mean it's totally 
                         irrelevant because a girl like that 
                         would never be caught dead with me...

                                     ENID
                         But putting that aside for now, would 
                         you go out with her?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I really didn't get a good look at 
                         her.

               A breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by.

                                     ENID
                         Okay, what about this one? Are you 
                         into girls with big tits?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (embarrassed)
                         Jesus!

                                     ENID
                         C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect 
                         data here! Don't you want me to find 
                         you your perfect dream girl?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm just not one of those guys who 
                         has a "type"...

                                     ENID
                         Every guy has a type!

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (he doesn't really 
                              mean this)
                         I mean as long as she's not a complete 
                         imbecile and she's even remotely 
                         attractive...

               They walk by "the pants."

                                     ENID
                         Hey look, there's Norman!

               He's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop.

                                     ENID
                         Hi Norman.

               Norman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid.

               EXT. CITY STREET/NEAR SIDEWINDER - DAY

               They're in another part of town near THE SIDEWINDER.

                                     ENID
                         We need to narrow this down somehow... 
                         we need to find a place where you 
                         can meet women who share your 
                         interests.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Maybe I don't want to meet someone 
                         who shares my interests.  I hate my 
                         interests! Where can I go to meet 
                         the exact opposite of myself?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your 
                         five main interests, in order of 
                         importance.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (sighs)
                         Well, let's see... I guess I'd have 
                         to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and 
                         Ragtime music at the top of the list, 
                         then probably...

                                     ENID
                         Let's just say "music" - that way 
                         you only use up one...
                              (spots The Sidewinder)
                         Wait, we have to go in here for a 
                         second...

               INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

               They enter. Josh has his back to the counter as he makes a 
               complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl.

                                     ENID
                         Hi Josh.

                                     JOSH
                              (without turning around)
                         Hi.

                                     ENID
                         I just stopped in to say hi.

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, well... hi...

               He turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae. He looks 
               up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour).

                                     ENID
                         This is my friend Seymour.

               Josh is startled and drops the sundae. The girl starts crying. 
               Josh immediately starts to clean up the mess. Enid, satisfied, 
               heads with Seymour for the door.

                                     ENID
                         See you later, Josh!

               As the door closes, we hear a familiar voice.

                                     BOSS
                         JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?

               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

               Enid & Seymour continue walking.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (pause)
                         So is that your boyfriend?

                                     ENID
                         Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend...  
                         He's just this guy that Becky and I 
                         like to torture.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well are --

                                     ENID
                              (interrupts suddenly)
                         Oh my god! We have to go in here!

               They are in front of STAN'S, a porno shop.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, sure... very funny....

                                     ENID
                         Please, Seymour... Becky and I have 
                         been dying to go in here but we can't 
                         get any boys to take us...  Please?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I - I'd really rather not...

                                     ENID
                         We'll just go in for one minute -- 
                         it'll be a riot!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't think so...

                                     ENID
                         PLEASE? We have to!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I really don't think it's a good 
                         idea.

                                     ENID
                         Fine, I'll go by myself then...

               INT. ANTHONY'S II - DAY

               Enid & Seymour enter. There are a half dozen MEN browsing 
               through the videos and magazines.

                                     ENID
                              (whispering)
                         Wow! Look at all these creeps!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Shh!

                                     ENID
                         OH MY GOD!

               Enid runs over and grabs a BLOW-UP SEX DOLL. Everyone in the 
               store looks at them. Seymour blushes and sweats.

                                     ENID
                         What kind of weirdo would actually 
                         have sex with this? We have to buy 
                         this!

               She looks around, over-stimulated.

                                     ENID
                         God, this place is a total riot!

               She picks up a magazine.

                                     ENID
                         Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - 
                         isn't child pornography totally 
                         illegal?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         These are older women just dressed 
                         up to look young... I think.

               ANGLE ON a pair of THIGH-HIGH LEATHER FETISH BOOTS.

                                     ENID (V.O.)
                         Oh my god!

               WIDER ANGLE: She's in another part of the store near the 
               CASHIER.

                                     ENID
                         How much are these boots? Do you 
                         have these in size five?

                                     CASHIER
                         That's the only pair of those I have 
                         right now. I'm getting a new order 
                         in next week...

               She spots something and gasps. She yells across the store.

                                     ENID
                         OH MY GOD SEYMOUR! You have to lend 
                         me the money to buy this.

               Everyone looks at Seymour as he sheepishly approaches. He 
               takes out his wallet.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, I don't have much money with me 
                         right now.

                                     ENID
                         C'mon, Seymour, please?

                                     CASHIER
                         Why don't you come back in two weeks - 
                         we'll be having our annual Back-to-
                         School sale.

               INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Rebecca is at the counter serving a long line of YUPPIES. We 
               can see a sign next to the counter that reads: "Answer today's 
               trivia question and get a free small coffee".

                                     YUPPIE #1
                         I'd like a medium latte for here.

                                     REBECCA
                         Can I get you a biscotti to go with 
                         that?

                                     YUPPIE #1
                         NO! Just the latte.

               Enid is next wearing a RUBBER BONDAGE MASK with devil horns.

                                     ENID (V.O.)
                         Give me all your money, bitch!

                                     REBECCA
                         Where did you get that?

                                     ENID
                         You won't believe it! Guess!

                                     REBECCA
                         Where?

                                     ENID
                         Anthony's II!

                                     REBECCA
                         No way... when?

                                     ENID
                         Just now... I went with Seymour.

                                     REBECCA
                         You cunt!

               FELDMAN is in line behind Enid. He's a poodle-haired, fedora 
               wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair-golf cart 
               contraption.

                                     FELDMAN
                         Excuse me - I can't read the trivia 
                         question!

               Enid is in the way. She reads it to him.

                                     ENID
                         "Where on the human body is the 
                         'Douglas Pouch' located?"

               Feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while 
               Rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee. A DIGITAL 
               GRAPHIC of the FEMALE FORM on his computer screen. With a 
               few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the 
               REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. An area behind the cervix BLINKS.

                                     FELDMAN
                         Slightly below the uterus on a female.

               He takes his coffee and putters towards the door.

                                     ENID
                         That guy is totally amazing.

                                     REBECCA
                         He does that every single day.

                                     YUPPIE #2
                         Can I get a decaf mocha to go?

                                     REBECCA
                         Can I get you a...

                                     YUPPIE #2
                         NO, I don't want a biscotti with 
                         that.

               YUPPIE #2 pays and leaves.

                                     ENID
                         God, how can you stand all these 
                         assholes?

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know... Some people are okay, 
                         but mostly I feel like poisoning 
                         everybody.

                                     ENID
                         At least the wheelchair guy is sort 
                         of entertaining...

                                     REBECCA
                         He's a total asshole... He doesn't 
                         even need that wheelchair, he's just 
                         totally lazy!

                                     ENID
                         That rules!

                                     REBECCA
                         No, it doesn't. You'll see... you 
                         get totally sick of all the creeps 
                         and losers and weirdos.

                                     ENID
                         But those are our people...

                                     REBECCA
                         Yeah, well...
                              (pause)
                         So when are you going to get your 
                         job?

                                     ENID
                         I'm working on it... I've got a few 
                         leads... it's just that right now I 
                         have, all these projects that take 
                         up all my time.

                                     REBECCA
                         Like what?

                                     ENID
                         Nothing. Don't worry... I promise 
                         I'll get a job next week.

                                     REBECCA
                              (pause)
                         God, I can't believe you went to 
                         Anthony's without me.

               INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Enid and her dad are eating breakfast. A 13" TV sits on the 
               kitchen counter behind them.

                         Hope comes in all forms. To the 
                         endangered white stork searching for 
                         wetlands it comes in the form of a 
                         sanctuary provided by people who 
                         care. Do people care? Chevron does. 
                         That's why at Chevron we're just as 
                         concerned...

                                     DAD
                         Are you still looking for a job? Do 
                         you have any leads?

                                     ENID
                         Will you get off my back for once?

                                     DAD
                         It's tough to find a good job without 
                         any kind of training.

                                     ENID
                         Look, I told you I'm not going to 
                         college.

                                     DAD
                         Well, I think it's good to keep all 
                         your options open. You can always 
                         enroll for the winter quarter.  You 
                         could even live here and go to the 
                         city college part time, and still 
                         get a job if you wanted to.

                                     ENID
                         Look at me -- I'm not even listening 
                         to a word you're saying.

               Pause.

                                     DAD
                         Did I tell you who I ran into at the 
                         bagel place?

                                     ENID

                         Who?

                         Guess.

                         How should I know?

                                     DAD
                         Someone from the past.

                         Who?

                                     DAD
                         Give up?

                                     ENID
                         YES.

                         Not the Maxine?

                                     DAD
                         Yup.

                         God, how horrifying.

               INT. COLLEGE COFFEE HOUSE DAY

               Enid and Rebecca sit in a semi-crowded college hang-out.

                         ...you don't have to make a million 
                         dollars -- just get any stupid job 
                         so we can at least start looking for 
                         an apartment.

                                     ENID
                              (thoughtful pause)
                         I wonder if I hang around with you 
                         because you're like my surrogate 
                         mother figure or something. Like I 
                         have this subconscious biological 
                         need to be nagged and bitched at 
                         constantly.

                                     REBECCA
                         You hang out with me because nobody 
                         else can stand to be around you.

                                     ENID
                         Or maybe... did you ever think that 
                         deep down we really might be lesbos? 
                         Maybe that's why we spend so much 
                         time together.

                                     REBECCA
                         You're gross.
                              (pause)
                         See that guy?

                                     ENID
                         Which one?

                                     REBECCA
                         He gives me a total boner!

                                     ENID
                         He's like the biggest idiot of all 
                         time!

               The guy, a COLLEGE SOPHOMORE, walks by them with two friends.

                                     COLLEGE SOPHOMORE
                         Are you guys up for some reggae 
                         tonight?

                                     REBECCA
                         Okay, you're right.

                                     ENID
                              (whispers)
                         Heads up.

               An earnest "ALTERNATIVE-ROCK" GUY approaches Rebecca. He 
               hands her a flyer.

                                     GUY
                         Hey, my band is playing here on Friday 
                         night and uh... there's gonna be a 
                         bunch of cool bands playing and stuff 
                         and you don't have to pay if you 
                         show this flyer at the door... you 
                         should come check it out.

                                     REBECCA
                              (shyly)
                         Thanks...
                              (she looks away)

               Enid takes the flyer from Rebecca.  There are a bunch of 
               bands listed.

                                     ENID
                         Which one is your band?

                                     GUY
                         Alien Autopsy.

                                     ENID
                              (sarcastic)
                         Bitchin'.

                                     GUY
                              (embarrassing pause; 
                              then, to Rebecca)
                         Yeah, well... maybe I'll see you 
                         there...
                              (pause; walks away)

                                     ENID
                         What a dork!

                                     REBECCA
                         You're just jealous.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, right... Believe me, at this 
                         point I'm over the fact that every 
                         single guy likes you better than me!

                                     REBECCA
                         Face it, you hate every single boy 
                         on the face of the earth!

                                     ENID
                         That's not true, I just hate all 
                         these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo-
                         bohemian losers!
                              (sad pause)
                         Sometimes I think I act so weird 
                         because I'm crazy from sexual 
                         frustration.

                                     REBECCA
                         Haven't you heard about the miracle 
                         of masturbation?

                                     ENID
                              (sighs)
                         ...maybe we should be lesbos...

                                     REBECCA
                         Get away from me!

               INT. ENID'S FANTASY - EVENING

               Starts on full moon in night sky, framed right --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ...a dark moonlit room. Enid lies on her stomach in bed. We 
               MOVE IN CLOSER to her head as though entering her thoughts, 
               which slowly fade in: WE MOVE TOWARD a vertical sliver of 
               light -- a cracked-open bathroom door.

               WE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower. Josh 
               enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of 
               flowers. CUT. We start again, exactly as before, only without 
               the flowers. He starts to take off his clothes. CUT. He enters 
               again and gets right in the shower, fully clothed.

               They begin to kiss. After a passionate moment, the door opens. 
               Rebecca stands there, stunned.

               CUT BACK TO:

               We see only the slightest trace of Enid in the darkness. She 
               sighs.

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               CLOSE-UP ON a charcoal portrait of DON KNOTTS.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Who is this, Enid?

                                     ENID
                         It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And what was your reason for choosing 
                         him as your subject?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I see... interesting...

               She moves on.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What do we have here, Margaret?

                                     MARGARET
                         It's a tampon in a teacup...

               Class GIGGLES.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I can see that... now what can you 
                         tell us about it? First of all, what 
                         kind of sculpture is this?

                                     MARGARET
                         It's a "found object"... that's when 
                         an artist takes an ordinary object 
                         and places it in an artistic context 
                         and thus it becomes art.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Very good. Now, what can you tell us 
                         about it in regard to your artistic 
                         intent?

                                     MARGARET
                         I guess I see the teacup as a symbol 
                         for womanhood, because of tea parties 
                         in the olden days, but instead of 
                         tea I was trying to kind of confront 
                         people with this... like...

                                     ROBERTA
                         This shocking image of repressed 
                         femininity!

                                     MARGARET
                         Right, exactly!

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think it's really a wonderful piece, 
                         Margaret!

               Enid gives Margaret another dirty look.

                                     ROBERTA
                         This illustrates perfectly what I 
                         was saying about not being afraid to 
                         use controversial imagery, class...

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - DUSK

               Seymour drives. Enid plays with the radio stopping on an 
               obnoxious AM Disc Jockey.

                                     DISC JOCKEY
                         KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful 
                         evening.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         God, that asshole's voice is so 
                         hateful! No wonder I never listen to 
                         the radio!

                                     ENID
                              (shutting it off)
                         Relax, Seymour, relax...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         That thing is just so shrill and 
                         piercing and loud - it's like someone 
                         jabbing me in the face!
                              (imitating insincere 
                              DJ voice)
                         KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful 
                         evening...

               She changes the subject and holds up a 78 record.

                                     ENID
                         So, why did you bring this along?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I brought it for him to autograph.  
                         He's going to be amazed to see it - 
                         it's one of two known copies... I 
                         can't believe they have him for the 
                         opening act and not the headliner.  
                         What an insult!

                                     ENID
                         This bar's going to be packed with 
                         girls for you to pick from.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm not holding my breath in that 
                         department.

               Seymour waits at a stop sign for two OBLIVIOUS OVERWEIGHT 
               WOMEN, each with TODDLERS and baby carriages, to cross..

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What are we, in slow motion here?!  
                         What are ya, hypnotized? Have some 
                         more kids, why don't you?... For 
                         Christ's sake, would you move!?

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, Seymour.

               EXT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

               A marquee reads, "TONITE: BLUESHAMMER also FRED CHATMAN"

               INT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

               FRED CHATMAN, age 82, plays an acoustic blues number. He's 
               good, but he's being politely ignored for the most part by 
               the TWENTY-SOMETHING PATRONS. Most of them are more interested 
               in a baseball game showing on a big-screen TV.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I can't believe these people! They 
                         could at least turn off their stupid 
                         sports game until he's done playing!

               FRED finishes to POLITE APPLAUSE. An M.C. takes the mic.

                                     M.C.
                         Let's hear it for Fred Chatman.
                              (a little more APPLAUSE)
                         Hey don't go away because we've got 
                         Blueshammer coming up in just a 
                         minute!

               A CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her 
               drink. Enid nods in her direction for Seymour's benefit as 
               if to say, "check it out."

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yes, that would certainly do...

                                     ENID
                         Well, offer her a seat! You want me 
                         to do it?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I 
                         gotta think of something to talk to 
                         her about. No! No...

                                     ENID
                         Just wait here.

               Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE 
               GIRL who looks back at Seymour and smiles. She goes to join 
               him. Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving 
               Seymour a "thumbs up."

                                     CUTE GIRL
                         Hi.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Hello. Uh... that was great music, 
                         huh?

                                     CUTE GIRL
                              (sitting down)
                         Yeah, I just love blues.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Actually, technically what he was 
                         mostly playing would more accurately 
                         be classified in the "ragtime" idiom. 
                         Although of course not in the 
                         strictest sense of the more classical 
                         ragtime piano music like that of 
                         Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic 
                         Blues has a more conventional twelve-
                         bar structure in its stanzas.

                                     CUTE GIRL
                         Oh if you like authentic blues, you've 
                         just gotta see Blueshammer!  They're 
                         so great!

               ANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour and 
               Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other people 
               in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop 
               on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He 
               makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue 
               twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on.

               She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off 
               her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse 
               and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted 
               by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty 
               boys.

                                     LANCE
                              (LEAD SINGER)
                         All right people! Are you ready to 
                         BOOGIE? Cuz we gwine play you some 
                         authentic, way-down-in-the-delta 
                         blues to rock your world! One, Two, 
                         Three...

               A din of loud noise. CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her feet, 
               boogeying to the music.

               Several horny ALPHA MALES press in on Seymour (who's still 
               sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her.

               Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward 
               the bar where Enid sits.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What did you tell that girl?

                                     ENID
                         I told her you were a big record 
                         executive and you were thinking of 
                         signing that band to your label.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Jesus...

               INT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - NIGHT

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Now I remember why I haven't gone 
                         anywhere in months. I'm not even in 
                         the same universe as those creatures 
                         back there. I might as well be from 
                         another planet.

                                     ENID
                         We just need to figure out a place 
                         where you can meet somebody who isn't 
                         a total idiot, that's all.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Look, I really appreciate your help, 
                         Enid, but let's face it, this is 
                         hopeless.

                                     ENID
                         It's not hopeless...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well it's simple for everybody 
                         else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair 
                         of Nikes and they're happy! I just 
                         can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity 
                         either, but I don't think it's totally 
                         hopeless...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         But it's not totally hopeless for 
                         you... I've had it. I don't even 
                         have the energy to try anymore.  You 
                         should make sure you do the exact 
                         opposite of everything I do so you 
                         don't end up like me...

                                     ENID
                         I'd rather end up like you than those 
                         people at that stupid bar...  At 
                         least you're an interesting person... 
                         at least you're not exactly like 
                         everybody else...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Hooray for me.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S APT. - NIGHT

               Enid walks in behind Seymour.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm not sure I have anything to 
                         drink... there might be some --

                                     ENID
                         It doesn't matter, I'm not staying 
                         long... I just want to make sure I 
                         convince you not to give up yet.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         "Yet."

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               They both have drinks now. He puts on a jazz record, an 
               instrumental.

                                     ENID
                              (picks up an antique 
                              knick knack)
                         Wow, this is so cool...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         If you don't mind my asking -- why 
                         do you care so much if I get a date 
                         or not?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... because I can't stand the 
                         idea of a world where a guy like you 
                         can't get a date...

               Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the 
               wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype 
               of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.

                                     ENID
                         What the fuck, Seymour?! What is 
                         this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What?... Oh that... I borrowed that 
                         from work about fifteen years ago... 
                         I guess it's mine now.

                                     ENID
                         What, are you a klansman or something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks 
                         a lot!... Do you know the Cook's 
                         Chicken franchise?

                                     ENID
                              (quoting TV commercial 
                              in deep voice)
                         "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried 
                         with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made 
                         up name. When they originally opened 
                         back in 1922 they were named "The 
                         Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early 
                         painting of their first logo.

               He takes out a scrapbook.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm obsessed with all this stuff - 
                         this lost culture of the 20th century.

               She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken 
               logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then 
               into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's 
               Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, 
               followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's 
               version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels 
               tracing the design evolution of a different company.

                                     ENID
                         Why doesn't everybody know this?

               The record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (somewhat bitterly)
                         It's ancient history. The same reason 
                         nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco 
                         record.

               He puts on another record.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Actually, I was a whole lot more 
                         interested in the Cook's phenomenon 
                         when I was about your age. I've kind 
                         of lost interest since I've been 
                         working for them...

                                     ENID
                         You work at Cook's Chicken?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         For nineteen years...

                                     ENID
                         What are you, a fry cook or something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Nothing so glamorous... actually, 
                         I'm an assistant manager at their 
                         corporate headquarters.

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work 
                         in an office all day.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Hey, I get good benefits, a good 
                         early retirement plan, nobody ever 
                         bothers me...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but still...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I make enough money to eat and buy 
                         old records... what more do I want?

               Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting.

                                     ENID
                         So, I don't really get it -- are you 
                         saying that things were better back 
                         then
                              (points at painting)
                         even though there was stuff like 
                         this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, in a lot of ways things are better 
                         now... I dunno... it's complicated. 
                         Everybody still hates each other, 
                         but they know how to hide it better, 
                         or something...

                                     ENID
                              (suddenly)
                         Hey, can I borrow this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What? Why?

                                     ENID
                         I promise I'll take good care of it.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I dunno... they're very sensitive at 
                         work about all this stuff. Maybe it 
                         would be better if you --

                                     ENID
                         Don't you trust me, Seymour?

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               We see another wall of student art dominated this time by 
               Enid's (Seymour's) 3' x 4' painting.

                         Let's address some discussion to 
                         this piece.

                                     SNOTTY GIRL
                         I don't like it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Can you tell us why?

                         I don't know.

                         I think it's totally weak.

                                     BLACK GIRL
                         Yeah, it's not right.

               More kids respond at once. Even Margaret is confused.

                         These are all valid comments, but I 
                         think we should see if the artist 
                         has anything to bring to this.

                                     ENID
                         Well, I got the idea when I was doing 
                         some research and I discovered that 
                         Cook's Chicken used to be called 
                         Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to 
                         do my project based on this discovery 
                         as kind of a comment on racism... 
                         and the way racism is whitewashed 
                         over in our culture...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Did you actually do this painting?

                                     ENID
                         Well, no - it's more like a "found 
                         art object."

                                     ROBERTA
                         And how do you think this addresses 
                         the subject of racism?

                                     ENID
                         It's complicated... I guess I'm trying 
                         to show how racism used to -- more 
                         out in the open and now it's hidden, 
                         or something...

                                     ROBERTA
                         And how does an image like this help 
                         us to see that?

                                     ENID
                         I'm not sure... I mean...
                              (thinks)
                         I guess because when we see something 
                         like this it seems really shocking 
                         and we have to figure out why it's 
                         so shocking?

               A long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the painting.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I don't really know what to say, 
                         Enid...
                              (another over-long 
                              pause)
                         ...It's a remarkable achievement.

               INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING

               Enid is lying on her back with her head on Rebecca's stomach.

               Both stare blankly at the ceiling.

                                     REBECCA
                         Are you kidding? It's a dream job!  
                         I can't believe you got a job like 
                         that without even trying... God, I 
                         wish that was my job...

                                     ENID
                              (trying to generate 
                              some enthusiasm)
                         Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least 
                         I'll get to see every movie for free, 
                         I guess... I had to lie and tell 
                         them I already graduated...

                                     REBECCA
                         When are you finally going to get 
                         your diploma?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno, but next week is my last 
                         class...

                                     REBECCA
                         Anyway, now we can start looking for 
                         the apartment...
                              (waits for some 
                              response from Enid, 
                              but there is none)
                         Do you remember when we first came 
                         up with that whole idea of renting 
                         our own apartment?

                                     ENID
                         Wasn't it like eighth grade?

                                     REBECCA
                         Seventh... you wanted to move out 
                         right then!

                                     ENID
                         That must have been when my dad was 
                         married to Maxine...

                                     REBECCA
                         I remember our big plan was as soon 
                         as we got the apartment we were going 
                         to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming 
                         over and then fuck him.

                                     ENID
                         We were such desperate sluts back 
                         then.

               INT. PACIFIC THEATER - AFTERNOON

               Enid is behind the candy counter dressed in a brown and orange 
               uniform.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm gonna let you handle the four 
                         thirty crowd by yourself - that way 
                         I can evaluate your performance while 
                         it's slow and ease you into the bigger 
                         crowds.

                                     ENID
                         You can count on me, sir!

               A customer, an ALCOHOLIC LOSER, approaches the candy counter.

                                     LOSER
                         Do you serve beer or any alcohol?

                                     ENID
                         I wish!... actually you wish... after 
                         about five minutes of this movie 
                         you'll wish to God you had about ten 
                         beers!

               LOSER stares blankly, hesitates, then goes into theater.

                                     MANAGER
                              (pulling her aside)
                         What are you doing? You don't ever 
                         criticize the feature!

                                     ENID
                         Why? What difference does it make?  
                         You already got his money...

                                     MANAGER
                         Look, that's the policy... if you 
                         want to make up your own rules you 
                         can open your own theater...

                                     ENID
                         But I was only trying to be 
                         friendly...

                                     MANAGER
                         Look, we don't pay you to be a movie 
                         critic -- just do your job.

                                     ENID
                         Okay, okay... I won't say a word...

               ANOTHER ANGLE - an hour has gone by.

                         That's three dollars.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Let me have plenty of butter on that.

                         Here you go -- smothered in delicious 
                         yellow-chemical sludge!

                                     MANAGER
                              (pulling her aside)
                         What the hell is wrong with you?!

                                     ENID
                         What? I'm just kidding around with 
                         the customers... It's my shtick!

                                     MANAGER
                         Well lose it! And why aren't you 
                         pushing the large sizes? Didn't you 
                         get training about upsizing?

                                     ENID
                         But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.

                                     MANAGER
                         It's not optional!

                                     ENID
                         Jesus...

                                     ENID
                         A medium sprite? Why sir, do you not 
                         know that for a mere twenty five 
                         cents more you could purchase a large 
                         beverage that has a volume of over 
                         twice that of a puny medium drink?
                              (she gives MANAGER a 
                              look)
                         ...I'm only telling you this because 
                         we're such good friends -- Medium is 
                         strictly for suckers who don't 
                         understand the concept of value!

               INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY

               Rebecca is behind the counter glaring at Enid.

                         What are you talking about? What 
                         kind of loser gets fired after one 
                         day?!

                         I told you - my manager was a total 
                         asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to 
                         get another job... and anyway, I 
                         have some ideas for how to make money 
                         in the meantime...

               An angry CUSTOMER returns with her drink.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         I'm not at all happy with this latte 
                         what do you intend to do about it?

               EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

               It's the next day. Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in front of 
               her apartment building. Rebecca arrives.

                                     REBECCA
                         This is it? I can't believe you're 
                         selling some of this stuff.

                                     ENID
                         Fuck it. Everything must go!

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my god, I remember this hat... 
                         this was during your little old lady 
                         phase...

               A trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through the 
               clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous 
               looking stuffed animal.

                                     HIPSTER
                         How much is this?

                                     ENID
                         That's not for sale.

                                     HIPSTER
                              (noticing price tag)
                         Wait, it says five dollars...

                                     ENID
                         Oh, that's a mistake -- I decided 
                         not to sell it...

               The HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves.

                                     REBECCA
                         What was that all about? I thought 
                         everything must go!

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let 
                         some asshole with a goatee own Goofy 
                         Gus.

               A couple is browsing. The GIRL, a severely skinny, CLUBHOPPER 
               TYPE in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the BOY, a long 
               haired SKATEBOARDER, goes through her records.

                                     GIRL
                         How much is this dress?

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my god, you're selling that?

                                     ENID
                              (long pause)
                         That's five hundred dollars.

                                     GIRL
                         What?

                                     ENID
                         Five hundred.

                                     GIRL
                         You're crazy -- it should be like 
                         two dollars!

                                     ENID
                         I was wearing that dress the day I 
                         lost my virginity.

                                     GIRL
                         Well why do I care about that?

                                     ENID
                         Why do you even want it? It would 
                         look stupid on you.

                                     GIRL
                         God, fuck you!

               Enid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book.

                                     ENID
                         Put that stuff back, it's not for 
                         sale.

                                     BOY
                         What is this? Some fuckin' joke?

                                     ENID
                         Yes! Go away!

               They stomp off.

                                     REBECCA
                         Now are you going to get a regular 
                         job?

                                     ENID
                              (defeated, quiet)
                         Don't worry.

                                     REBECCA
                         If it makes you feel any better, I 
                         don't think you could've gotten more 
                         than ten bucks for all this stuff.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, thanks.

               EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

               Twenty minutes later. Most of the stuff is gone. Enid packs 
               up one last box to carry inside.

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you want to do something tonight?

                                     ENID
                         I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...
                              (suddenly)
                         Shit! What time is it?  I have to go 
                         to the store! I was going to make 
                         him a cake...

                                     REBECCA
                              (miffed, sighs)
                         Well, are we still going shopping 
                         tomorrow?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, I guess... call me...

               She heads toward the stairs with the box. Rebecca watches 
               her go.

                                     REBECCA
                         Since when can you make a cake?

               INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - EVENING

               Enid presents Seymour with a HOSTESS CUPCAKE with a single 
               lit candle in the center. The lights are off.

                                     ENID
                         You can open your eyes now.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I 
                         really appreciate it...

                                     ENID
                         No, Doofus... blow it out!

               He leans forward and blows out the candle, then abruptly 
               straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain. Enid 
               turns the lights back on.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...

                                     ENID
                         Are you okay?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just my stupid back. I'll be 
                         all right in a minute...

               She notices him adjust something under his shirt.

                                     ENID
                         What is that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh... uh... It's just this elastic 
                         thing I have to wear for lumbar 
                         support...

                                     ENID
                         What, like a girdle?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Maybe now you understand why I can't 
                         get a date.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, well, you're not the only one.  
                         Everybody I know has totally fucked 
                         up problems... It seems like only 
                         stupid people have good 
                         relationships...

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (sarcastically cheering 
                              her on)
                         That's the spirit!

                                     ENID
                         I mean, I'm eighteen years old and 
                         I've never even had a real, steady 
                         boyfriend for more than like two 
                         weeks!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Really?

                                     ENID
                         Never...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm starting to think that even if I 
                         did get a girlfriend it really 
                         wouldn't change anything.

                                     ENID
                         I know. It's not like it makes all 
                         your problems go away.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Then again, that's easy for me to 
                         say, since I'll never even get a 
                         date. I'm sure you have hundreds of 
                         guys who are interested in you.

                                     ENID
                         Actually, I've got a total crush on 
                         this one guy right now, but it's a 
                         really fucked-up situation...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh yeah?

                                     ENID
                         Oh wait, you met him... remember 
                         that guy Josh? I'm like practically 
                         obsessed with him, but I can't do 
                         anything about it because Becky would 
                         freak out.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Why?

                                     ENID
                         Never mind, it's way too 
                         complicated...
                              (pause)
                         Did you have problems like this when 
                         you were my age - where you're totally 
                         confused all the time?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I won't even dignify that with a 
                         response.

               He gets up and looks through his shelves for a record.

                                     ENID
                              (looking at his records)
                         I wonder if you really like all these 
                         old records or if you only like the 
                         fact that nobody else likes them?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (a sore subject)
                         Who knows?

               The phone RINGS. Seymour ignores it.

                                     ENID
                         Aren't you going to get that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Let the machine get it. I have no 
                         desire to talk to anyone who would 
                         be calling me...

               After several more RINGS the machine picks up and we hear 
               Seymour's message. After the BEEP there's a long fumbling 
               pause...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I knew it... it's my mother.

                                     VOICE ON MACHINE
                         Uh... HI!  Uh... I'm calling for... 
                         um... you placed an ad in the Weekly 
                         over a month ago and... well, I'm 
                         the redhead in the yellow dress... 
                         at least I think I am... I saw the 
                         ad when you first placed it but I 
                         was in this relationship at the time 
                         so I cut it out, and now I'm not in 
                         the relationship anymore...
                              (giggles)
                         God, this is really confusing... 
                         anyway, if you still want to talk to 
                         me I can be reached at KL5-2603, 
                         that's my work number and my name is 
                         Dana... um... BYE!

                                     ENID
                         Wow!
                              (feigning ignorance)
                         What was that all about?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just somebody's idea of a joke...

                                     ENID
                         That didn't sound like a joke to 
                         me... what, did you write a personal 
                         ad or something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (still confused)
                         Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called 
                         before once... it's just somebody 
                         trying to humiliate me.

                                     ENID
                         Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a 
                         joke -- you have to call her back!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         How can you be so sure?

                                     ENID
                         Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff 
                         like this -- she was totally for 
                         real!

               INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - ABOUT 10 PM

               Enid enters - a light is on in the kitchen.

                                     DAD (O.S.)
                         Pumpkin? Could you come in here for 
                         a minute?

               She walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment. She 
               sees, first, her Dad (wearing an apron) and then, a hauntingly 
               familiar MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.

                                     DAD
                         Pumpkin, do you remember Maxine?

                                     MAXINE
                         Hi, Enid.

                                     ENID
                         Hi.
                              (to Dad)
                         Look, I'm kind of tired - I think 
                         I'll go to bed.

                                     DAD
                         I made spaghetti. Do you want some?

                                     ENID
                         I-I really have to get up early for 
                         class tomorrow.

                                     MAXINE
                         It's really quite something to see 
                         you all grown up like this, Enid.
                              (no response from 
                              Enid)
                         I'd love to hear about what you're 
                         doing. I can't help but feel that I 
                         had some small part in how you turned 
                         out...
                              (another silent pause)
                         What are you studying? You were always 
                         such a smart little girl.

                                     ENID
                         I'm taking a remedial high school 
                         art class for fuck-ups and retards.

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               A toothy, zit-covered 14-YEAR-OLD BOY poses with a very poorly-
               made sculpture. A flash goes off and he jumps slightly, 
               sending pieces of his sculpture flying.

               It's Roberta, taking photos. She moves on to Enid, in front 
               of her big painting.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Smile, Enid...

               Enid ad-libs a weird expression as... the flash goes off.

               Roberta now turns to address the class.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm going to miss you people... I 
                         feel that we've all done a lot of 
                         growing this summer. I hope that 
                         each of you feels as though you'll 
                         be taking away something from this 
                         experience; I know I certainly will 
                         be...

               A long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Remember, the art show is this 
                         Saturday at seven-thirty sharp. Try 
                         to get there at least 15 minutes 
                         early.

               The students get their things together and file out.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?

                                     ENID
                         Uh-oh.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I 
                         was just wondering what your plans 
                         were for next year?

                                     ENID
                         I'm not really sure - working, I 
                         guess...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, I know this is really short 
                         notice, but I got a call from a very 
                         close friend at the Academy of Art & 
                         Design and she tells me that I'm 
                         allowed to place one student from 
                         your graduating class in a one year 
                         scholarship program... and, well, I 
                         hope you don't mind, Enid, but I 
                         took the liberty of submitting your 
                         name.

               She gives her a booklet and an application form.

                                     ENID
                         Hmm.

                                     ROBERTA
                         As far as I know it includes housing 
                         and meals and everything... it is 
                         really quite an offer...

                                     ENID
                         ...wow...

                                     ROBERTA
                              (pause)
                         So what do you think?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... Would I have to take 
                         classes and stuff?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, yes...

                                     ENID
                         I...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. 
                         This could be a great thing for you.

               INT. INDOOR SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca are in a Crate & Barrel-type store looking at 
               housewares.

                                     ENID
                         I think one of us should fuck Josh...

                                     REBECCA
                         Go ahead...

                                     ENID
                         No, really...

                                     REBECCA
                         God, you're really obsessed...

                                     ENID
                         I am not -- I just think it'd be 
                         funny to see what he'd do...

                                     REBECCA
                         I thought we decided that Josh was 
                         way too cool to be interested in 
                         sex, and that he's the only decent 
                         person left in the world and we would 
                         never want to bring him down to our 
                         level and all that...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but maybe one of us should at 
                         least try...

                                     REBECCA
                         No matter what happened it would be 
                         a big disaster... Let's just try and 
                         keep everything the way it is.

               Rebecca spots some particularly fetching dishware.

                                     REBECCA
                         Look, we have to get these...

                                     ENID
                         I can't afford stuff like this right 
                         now.

                                     REBECCA
                         I'm sick of waiting - we need to 
                         start getting stuff if we're ever 
                         going to move.
                              (pause, sees towels)
                         Aren't these the greatest towels?

                                     ENID
                         Why do you care about this kind of 
                         stuff?

                                     REBECCA
                         Don't you want nice stuff?

                                     ENID
                         I can't imagine spending money on 
                         towels.

                                     REBECCA
                         You don't have to. I'll pay for all 
                         the stuff right now and you can pay 
                         me back when you finally get a job.

                                     ENID
                         You're insane.

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you still want to go to that thing 
                         tonight?

                                     ENID
                         What thing?

                                     REBECCA
                         That guy's band is playing tonight... 
                         Alien Autopsy.

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going 
                         on his big date tonight and I kind 
                         of want to be around when he calls, 
                         so I can hear how bad it went.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, I'm so sick of Seymour.

               INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               Seymour is just finishing the dinner DANA has cooked for 
               them at her place. Dana is an attractive redhead, about 40.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         That was great - jeez, thanks again 
                         for cooking all this.

                                     DANA
                         Oh I love to cook. I guess most women 
                         wouldn't invite a man over on the 
                         first date, but I believe you should 
                         trust your instincts. When I talked 
                         to you on the phone you just seemed 
                         so... I don't know... harmless. Ready 
                         for ice cream?

               Dana heads for the kitchen. Seymour gets up to relieve his 
               backache. He walks over to a framed photo on the wall.

                                     DANA
                         Here we are... it's mocha mint from 
                         Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that 
                         photograph just heart-rending?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?

                                     DANA
                         Was it Bosnia? I forget...
                              (pause)
                         It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire 
                         country eloquently captured in the 
                         face of one little boy.
                              (pause)
                         A Soul/Funk song starts up on the 
                         radio that catches her attention. 
                         She goes over and turns it up.

                                     DANA
                         Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it 
                         great? Doesn't it make you want to 
                         dance? C'mon!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, 
                         heh, heh...

                                     DANA
                         Don't be silly, anyone can dance.  
                         Here, just follow me... watch my 
                         feet.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, really I --

               She drags him around. He's still holding his ice cream.

                                     DANA
                         C'mon Seymour, it's all in your mind. 
                         Just loosen up and feel the music! 
                         Here, put down your bowl of ice cream.

               She takes his ice cream and puts it on a table.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (checking his watch)
                         Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're 
                         gonna have to leave now if we're 
                         going to make that movie.

                                     DANA
                         Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just 
                         let me put a few things away.

               She shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream.

                                     DANA
                         I'm so excited to see this film - 
                         Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant 
                         director! Did you see his last film, 
                         The Flower That Drank The Moon? It 
                         was simply glorious!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, no. I missed that one. But what 
                         do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy 
                         movies.

                                     DANA
                         Really? I never really cared for 
                         those. Why does the fat one always 
                         have to be so mean to the skinny 
                         one?

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - EVENING

               It's 9:30 PM. Enid is drawing in her sketchbook. She looks 
               impatiently at the phone. Time passes - it's 11 PM. She can't 
               stand it anymore.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               Seymour picks up the phone. Dana is in the background getting 
               some ice in the kitchen.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... hello?

                                     ENID
                         Hi, it's me...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh, hi...

                                     ENID
                         So, what happened?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (almost whispering)
                         Actually, it's kind of still 
                         happening... she's over here right 
                         now... I think everything's going 
                         pretty well...

                                     ENID
                         What? You're kidding me...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, so I better go -- it's not 
                         really the best time to talk...

                                     ENID
                         What, are you going to like have sex 
                         with her on your first date?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you 
                         later... bye!

               He hangs up. Enid is stunned... Now what? She calls Rebecca.

               INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Rebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone 
               RINGS. She picks it up.

                                     REBECCA
                         Hello?

                                     ENID
                         Do you still want to do something 
                         tonight?

                                     REBECCA
                         What happened to Seymour?

                                     ENID
                              (still shocked by 
                              this)
                         I can't believe it - he actually 
                         scored!

                                     REBECCA
                         How repulsive!

                                     ENID
                         So should I come over?

                                     REBECCA
                         Actually, I'm just about to go out 
                         with some friends...

                                     ENID
                         What are you talking about? Who?

                                     REBECCA
                         Just some people from work...

                                     ENID
                         I don't believe you.

                                     REBECCA
                         Yeah well, you said you were busy... 
                         look, I'd better get going... I'll 
                         call you tomorrow.

               Rebecca hangs up. Clearly, she's not going anywhere.

               EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Enid stands outside Josh's door. A tentative pause; then she 
               knocks. Josh opens the door, stunned. Enid is wearing an 
               uncharacteristically "sexy" outfit.

                                     JOSH
                         Hi... what's up?

                                     ENID
                         Can I come in?

               INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               She goes in and looks around nervously... the note (Tiffany 
               & Amber) is tacked to the wall.

                                     JOSH
                         Are you the one who left that note?

                                     ENID
                         I guess.

               Pause. Enid sits down on futon/sofa.

                                     JOSH
                         So what's up?

               He picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously.

                                     ENID
                         I don't know... I'm totally 
                         confused...

               Josh doesn't respond - there's another awkward pause.

                                     ENID
                         Sit over here.

               He sits, tentatively. Long pause.

                                     JOSH
                         Do you want something to drink?

                                     ENID
                         Why?

                                     JOSH
                         What do you mean "why"?

                                     ENID
                         Are you trying to get me wasted so 
                         you can take advantage of my womanly 
                         charms?

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, right...

                                     ENID
                         "Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's 
                         so wrong with me?

                                     JOSH
                         Nothing.

                                     ENID
                         Then why do you hate me so much?

                                     JOSH
                         When did I say I hated you?

                                     ENID
                         You've never once said anything even 
                         remotely nice to me.

                                     JOSH
                         You make me nervous! I always feel 
                         like you're going out of your way to 
                         make me feel uncomfortable so you 
                         can laugh at me!

                                     ENID
                         That's just the way I am!

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, well --

                                     ENID
                         It's just my stupid way of getting 
                         attention! God, I practically love 
                         you, Josh!

               Stunned pause, then she bravely leans forward and kisses 
               him.  He kisses back but she is clearly the aggressor... 
               they get more and more into it.

                                     ENID
                         Do you have any protection?

               INT. JOSH'S APT. - 1 AM.

               Later, post-coital on the now unfolded futon... Enid lies on 
               her back, Josh is face-down on top of her with his head to 
               the side. Enid has a blank, disillusioned stare.

                                     JOSH
                              (now he's romantic 
                              and sappy)
                         You must have known all along how I -- 
                         you know -- how I felt about you -- 
                         it must be totally obvious...  God... 
                         I always used to dream about this...

                                     ENID
                              (staring ahead)
                         Why do you have that stupid poster?

               INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - DAY

               It's the next morning. Josh is asleep. Enid, fully awake and 
               dressed, sits on the bed looking at him, thoroughly 
               disillusioned. She pulls out a record from his collection 
               and grimaces. She opens a closet door and finds an electric 
               guitar.

                                     JOSH
                              (waking up, groggy, 
                              happily surprised)
                         Oh, hi...

                                     ENID
                         Why do all guys have to play stupid 
                         guitars? It's so typical... Either 
                         they're into cars or guns or sports 
                         or guitars... it's so obvious...

                                     JOSH
                         How long have you been up?

                                     ENID
                         I couldn't sleep... I should get 
                         going; I feel really weird...

                                     JOSH
                         Do you want to go get breakfast 
                         somewhere?

                                     ENID
                         I don't think we should... Look, you 
                         have to totally promise me you won't 
                         tell Becky about this.

                                     JOSH
                         Why not?

                                     ENID
                         Because if you do, I'll kill you!

                                     JOSH
                         Okay... I promise.

                                     ENID
                         Just take my word for it... if she 
                         ever finds out about this I'll never 
                         hear the end of it...

               INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DAY

               Rebecca is dressed in her best apartment-hunting outfit. She 
               sits on her bed, dialing the phone with the FREE WEEKLY open 
               on her lap. She circles something with her pen while the 
               phone rings.

                                     REBECCA
                         Goddammit, bitch -- where are you?

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM -DAY

               Enid lies perfectly still on her bed, staring at the ceiling 
               while the phone rings.

               EXT. COOK'S CHICKEN INN - DAYTIME

               Establish the restaurant.

               INT. COOK'S CHICKEN INN - DAYTIME

               Seymour sits alone eating lunch. We see Enid approach 
               stealthily from behind.

                                     ENID
                         Boo!

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (very startled)
                         YAAA!

               She sits across from him.

                                     ENID
                         Where have you been? I've been looking 
                         all over for you... I've been 
                         wandering the streets day and night 
                         trying to find you...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Really?

                                     ENID
                         No, actually Joe told me you were 
                         here... so how come you never call 
                         me anymore?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been 
                         really busy...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going 
                         with what's-her-name? Dana?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (he looks nervously 
                              at his watch)
                         Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... 
                         you know...

                                     ENID
                         So, what kind of stuff do you guys 
                         do together? Is she into old records 
                         and stuff?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Sort of... she doesn't dislike any 
                         of that stuff... she's trying, 
                         anyway... actually, we're supposed 
                         to go antique shopping for her 
                         apartment this afternoon...

                                     ENID
                              (not convinced)
                         Sounds good...

               Seymour looks again at his watch.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         We really should get together sometime 
                         soon... I-I'll definitely call you 
                         this week --

                                     ENID
                         What, are you trying to get rid of 
                         me?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No... no, it's just that I should 
                         get going in a few minutes, and --

                                     ENID
                         Aren't you even going to ask me how 
                         I'm doing?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... okay, I guess...
                              (pause)
                         I fucked that guy Josh finally...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...so... is he your boyfriend now?

                                     ENID
                         Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, 
                         of course. I'm weighing several offers 
                         at the present time...

               Suddenly, Dana enters.

                                     DANA
                         Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess 
                         I'm a little early...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Dana! Hi!
                              (pause as the gears 
                              whirl)
                         Uh, Dana... this is Enid...

                                     DANA
                         Hello...

                                     ENID
                         It's great to finally meet you!

               Dana sits next to Seymour, facing Enid.

                                     DANA
                              (looking back and 
                              forth between Enid 
                              and Seymour)
                         How do you two know each other?

                                     ENID
                         I'm surprised he hasn't mentioned me 
                         we're old friends.

                                     DANA
                         Really?

                                     ENID
                         Yes, we're very close... In fact, I 
                         was standing right next to Seymour 
                         the first time you called. If not 
                         for me, he would have never called 
                         you back!

                                     DANA
                         Is that right?

               Seymour begins to stammer some kind of response.

                                     ENID
                              (phony)
                         Oops! Look at the time!  I've got to 
                         run! I'll stop by to see you some 
                         time, Seymour...
                              (then to Dana)
                         It was really great to meet you!

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

               Enid is in her room getting dressed. Dad enters.

                                     DAD
                         I have some good news for you, 
                         Pumpkin.

                                     ENID
                              (sigh)
                         What is it now?

                                     DAD
                         Are you still looking for a job?

                                     ENID
                         I guess.

                                     DAD
                         Well, Maxine thinks she can get you 
                         a sales job at Computer Station.  
                         Normally you have to have references 
                         and at least two years of experience, 
                         but she thinks she can convince them.

                                     ENID
                         Tell her to forget it - I don't need 
                         her help.

               INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

               A homemade banner reads: "HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD 
               AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE." Along one wall is all the 
               work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract 
               bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn 
               a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three 
               PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn 
               seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for 
               the first time).

                                     DIRECTOR
                         I'm afraid you're simply going to 
                         have to take that painting down.  
                         Several of the parents have 
                         complained.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I will do no such thing.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Then you leave me no other choice 
                         than to remove it myself!

               She marches towards it. Roberta runs after her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think we should give the artist a 
                         chance to talk to the parents about 
                         her intentions with this piece...  
                         We should be promoting discussion as 
                         a solution, not censorship.

               Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Margaret, have you seen Enid?

               Margaret shrugs "no." ROBERTA looks through the crowd. A 
               college-age news-hack-type with a FREE WEEKLY T-SHIRT snaps 
               a photo of the DIRECTOR removing Enid's painting.

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING

               Enid, dressed as though for a glamorous date, stands knocking 
               on Seymour's door.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh... uh, hi... What's up?

               INT. SEYMOUR'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

               Enid worms her way past his unwelcoming stance. Seymour is 
               wearing designer stone-washed denim jeans that look ridiculous 
               on him. Joe can be seen in the kitchen.

                                     ENID
                         I'm going to this stupid art show 
                         and I want you to be my date...  
                         There's something I have to show 
                         you...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I don't know. I don't really 
                         think I should...

                                     ENID
                         Of course you should. C'mon, I'm 
                         already a million hours late.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...I better not...

                                     ENID
                              (pause)
                         Well forget the art show... let's do 
                         something else.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I wish I could, Enid, but I 
                         really can't right now... I -- it's 
                         just that I --

                                     ENID
                         Well when can we do something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just that, well, you know, Dana 
                         just got out of a really bad 
                         relationship and I don't want to 
                         give her the wrong idea... you know...

                                     JOE
                              (walking by with his 
                              sandwich)
                         Don't mind me, I'll just be in my 
                         room.

                                     ENID
                         Where did you get those pants?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh, uh... they were a present from 
                         Dana.

                                     ENID
                         And you like them?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well, you know... what do I know 
                         about clothes... I've never been the 
                         most fashionable guy -- it's nice to 
                         have someone do all the work for 
                         me...

                                     ENID
                              (pause)
                         So that's it? You don't ever want to 
                         see me again?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, of course I do... It's just that 
                         right now I need to --

                                     ENID
                         What's her problem anyway?  Did she 
                         actually tell you you couldn't see 
                         me?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, no... not exactly... she just 
                         doesn't understand how I would know 
                         somebody like you...

                                     ENID
                         What does she mean by that - "somebody 
                         like me"?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Just someone so young...

                                     ENID
                         You must have done something to make 
                         her think you like me.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I don't think so.

                                     ENID
                         Does that mean you don't like me?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, of course not.

                                     ENID
                              (looks him in the eye)
                         So, do you like me, Seymour?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         In what way do you mean?

                                     ENID
                         In whatever way you think I mean.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (not sure what to 
                              say; long pause)
                         I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's 
                         a very jealous person. I just don't 
                         want to screw that up right now... 
                         I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we 
                         can go back to being friends...

                                     ENID
                         I don't think you understand how I 
                         really feel about you, Seymour.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...What do you mean?

                                     ENID
                              (pause)
                         Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother 
                         you any more.

               EXT. ENID'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

               A LONG SHOT of Enid as she walks home alone.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca walk down the street. Both wear landlord 
               friendly J. Crew outfits.

                                     ENID
                         Where are we? This is a weird 
                         neighborhood...

                                     REBECCA
                         It's a totally normal, average 
                         neighborhood!

                                     ENID
                         I just mean it's weird to me...  
                         I've never been anywhere near here 
                         in my life.

                         Josh says this is a really good 
                         neighborhood...

                                     ENID
                         What? When did you see Josh?!

                                     REBECCA
                         He came into work.

                                     ENID
                         Why? What did he say?

                                     REBECCA
                         Nothing.

                                     ENID
                         When was this?

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know! God, don't act so 
                         jealous I only talked to him for two 
                         minutes.

               They walk along in conspicuous silence.

                                     REBECCA
                         Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you 
                         see it?
                              (looks around)
                         That must be it...

                                     ENID
                              (without enthusiasm)
                         Great...

                                     REBECCA
                         What?! It looks totally normal... 
                         what's wrong with it?

                                     ENID
                         I said "great"...

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh yeah, I can tell you really love 
                         it!

                                     ENID
                         Well, what am I supposed to say? "I 
                         can't wait to live in some depressing 
                         shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!

                                     REBECCA
                         There's something wrong with every 
                         single place we look at! Why don't 
                         you just come right out and tell me 
                         you don't want to move in with me?!

                                     ENID
                         Because you'll freak out and act 
                         like a total psycho about it.

               A few passersby stop to watch.

                                     REBECCA
                         You're the psycho! You haven't been 
                         able to deal with anything since 
                         high school ended!

                                     ENID
                         You're the one who's still living 
                         out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!

                                     REBECCA
                              (as she walks away 
                              giving her the finger)
                         FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your 
                         dad for the rest of your life!

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

               Enid is on her bed, crying. Her jacket and shoes are strewn 
               about the floor.

                                     ENID
                         God FUCK YOU TOO!

               We see her Dad standing outside her bedroom. As he enters he 
               tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before 
               she really embarrasses herself. She stops crying and pretends 
               to be asleep.

                                     DAD
                         Pumpkin? What's wrong?

                                     ENID
                              (her back to him, 
                              doesn't move)
                         Nothing.

               Dad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her 
               shoulder.

                                     DAD
                         If there's something wrong I wish 
                         you'd tell me about it...

               Enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of 
               the bed, facing away from him

                                     ENID
                         It's nothing -- it's just some 
                         hormonal thing... don't worry about 
                         it...

                                     DAD
                         I've got some important news to tell 
                         you, but it can wait till later if 
                         you're not feeling...

                                     ENID
                         What?

                                     DAD
                              (speaking slowly and 
                              methodically)
                         Well... as you know, Maxine and I 
                         have been seeing a lot of each other, 
                         and we decided it might be a good 
                         idea for all of us if she came back 
                         here to live at the end of the Summer, 
                         just so we can all get to know each 
                         other and to make sure this is what 
                         we want.

               Enid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before 
               she bursts into tears, utterly defeated.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY

               Enid, determined, walks down the empty halls. She goes into 
               a room marked "Art Class".

               INT. ART CLASS - CONTINUOUS

               Roberta is in there with a bearded EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE.

               They're covering a STUDENT in plaster.

                                     ENID
                         Hi I brought over my application for 
                         the art academy... I hope it's not 
                         too late...

               Roberta, absorbed in her plastering, glances at Enid.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Just a minute...

               Then, realizing who it is...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Enid! I'm so sorry about what 
                         happened.

                                     ENID
                         What do you mean?

                                     ROBERTA
                         The whole business with the art show 
                         and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --

                                     ENID
                         Huh?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?

                                     ENID
                         I didn't check my messages...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh my goodness... well, the whole 
                         thing is just ridiculous, and as 
                         soon as the school board is back in 
                         session next Fall I'm going to do 
                         everything I can to help you.

                                     ENID
                         Help me what?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well they're forcing me to give you 
                         a non-passing grade in the class 
                         because of what happened at the 
                         exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm 
                         sure I'll be able to get you your 
                         diploma in the Fall!

                                     ENID
                              (pause, overwhelmed)
                         But... can I still get that 
                         scholarship to the Art Academy?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an 
                         official high school graduate before 
                         I can nominate you.  I had to give 
                         it to someone else...  But I'm sure 
                         next year I can --

               The PLASTER-COVERED STUDENT makes an uncomfortable moaning 
               noise.

                                     EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE
                              (flustered, to Roberta)
                         Hey, can you help me out over here?

               EXT. QUALITY CAFE - EVENING (SAME DAY)

               Enid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the 
               Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING.

               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - LATER

               She continues walking until she's across the street from 
               Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly, 
               a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls 
               up to the stop and Norman gets on.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (ABOUT 11 PM)

               A knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pants, 
               and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and sees 
               Enid. He opens the door.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What are you doing here?

                                     ENID
                         I had to see you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What's up?

                                     ENID
                         Can you at least let me in?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... sure... come in.

                                     ENID
                              (crying)
                         Look, I just need somebody to be 
                         nice to me for five minutes and then 
                         I'll leave you alone.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What's the matter?

                                     ENID
                         Do you have anything to drink?

               Enid goes to look for herself.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... I think there's some root 
                         beer...

                                     ENID
                         What about this?

               She returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be 
                         saving it for our two-month 
                         anniversary. You better not --

                                     ENID
                              (as she starts opening)
                         FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.

               She opens it and drinks straight from the bottle. Seymour's 
               look says: "Oh well, I'm fucked, I give up."

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Enid & Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and 
               drinking out of the bottle.

                                     ENID
                         You need a bigger place - this is 
                         like a little kid's room.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I could never move - I've got too 
                         much stuff.

               Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. 
               She goes over and picks it up.

                                     ENID
                         Where did you get this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Dana bought it when we went antique 
                         shopping. She said it didn't go with 
                         her stuff, so she gave it to me... 
                         she thought it fit in better with my 
                         "old time thingamajigs."

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, how can you stand her?

               Seymour takes another slug off the bottle.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         God, she's going to kill me... this 
                         bottle is half-empty!

                                     ENID
                         That's great! "Half-empty" - that's 
                         what I like about you, Seymour, you're 
                         a natural pessimist!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         If you expect the worst, you're never 
                         disappointed.

                                     ENID
                         What are you talking about? You're 
                         disappointed every minute of your 
                         life.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm just being realistic.

                                     ENID
                         At least you're not like every other 
                         stupid guy in the world - all they 
                         care about are guitars and sports... 
                         they're all such fags!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I hate sports.

                                     ENID
                         How come in all that time I was trying 
                         to get you a date, you never asked 
                         me out?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You're a beautiful young girl... I 
                         can't imagine you would ever have 
                         had any interest in me, except as an 
                         amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but still... it's kind of 
                         insulting for a girl to be ignored 
                         like that.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I mean... of course I... why wouldn't 
                         I want to go out with you?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... I always feel like 
                         everybody secretly hates me. I'm 
                         just paranoid I guess. I mean, you 
                         like me don't you? We're good friends, 
                         right?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, sure. Of course.

                                     ENID
                              (contemplative pause)
                         ...Maybe I should just move in here 
                         with you... I could do all the cooking 
                         and dust your record collection and 
                         stuff until I get a job.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What about Joe?

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah... and Dana...
                              (says her name with 
                              whiny, disdainful 
                              voice)
                         You were a lot more fun before you 
                         met Dana. You've been acting way too 
                         normal lately... you're a bitter, 
                         twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, 
                         that's why I like you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (more drunk than before)
                         Yeah, well I like you too...

               TEN MINUTES LATER

               The bottle is empty.

                                     ENID
                         You know what my number one fantasy 
                         used to be?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (pause)
                         What?

                                     ENID
                         I used to think about one day not 
                         telling anybody and just taking off 
                         and going to some random place...  
                         Do you ever think about stuff like 
                         that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I guess I probably used to when I 
                         was your age.

                                     ENID
                         It would have to be some totally 
                         average day when nobody was expecting 
                         it, and I'd just disappear and they'd 
                         never see me again.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Sounds like a healthy way to deal 
                         with your problems.

                                     ENID
                         You know what we should do? Let's go 
                         get in your car right now and just 
                         take off! We could just drive away 
                         and find some new place and start a 
                         whole new life... fuck everybody!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't think I'm in any condition 
                         to drive.

                                     ENID
                         I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in 
                         a blaze of glory!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         So where would we go?

                                     ENID
                         Who cares? Let's just go... what's 
                         stopping us?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I dunno, I...

                                     ENID
                         I'm serious! I'm just so sick of 
                         everybody! Why can't I just do 
                         whatever I want?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What do you want?

                                     ENID
                         What do you want?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I-I-I...

                                     ENID
                         What's the matter with you, Seymour? 
                         Don't you like me? Be a man for once 
                         in your life!

               She kisses him passionately. He's shocked but kisses back.

               This escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful 
               brevity.

               WE SEE Enid & Seymour, post-coital.

                                     ENID
                         God, Dana's going to kill you!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...Do you really want us to drive 
                         away somewhere?

                                     ENID
                         What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I will if you want to.

                                     ENID
                         No... forget it...

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (embarrassingly sappy)
                         I-I never expected anything like 
                         this to happen...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, well... me neither...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You must know I always... did you 
                         really mean all that about moving in 
                         with me?

                                     ENID
                         I was just thinking out loud...
                              (doesn't want to hurt 
                              his feelings)
                         I mean, you've got this whole thing 
                         with Dana -- I'm not going to let 
                         you fuck that up...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         But, I...

                                     ENID
                         Shhh... I really need to get some 
                         sleep.

               Enid turns her back to him. We see from REVERSE ANGLE that 
               she's only pretending to be asleep. She looks troubled, as 
               though she's just made a big mistake. Seymour puts his arm 
               around her. It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed 
               and happy.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Good night...

               He kisses her arm and goes to sleep.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Seymour wakes up. Enid is gone.

               INT. DANA'S OFFICE - EXPANSION REALTY - DAY

               Dana is on the phone. A lantern-jawed male COLLEAGUE listens 
               in, his head pressed up against hers.

                                     DANA
                              (into phone)
                         It's a thirty-year fixed at five and-
                         a-half...

               Seymour nervously enters her "workspace". Dana is pleasantly 
               surprised - she stops her conversation.

                                     DANA
                              (covering receiver)
                         Seymour! Hello! What are you doing 
                         here?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt 
                         finish your phone call.

                                     DANA
                         We're almost done.
                              (she continues into 
                              phone)
                         Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded.  
                         They've already paid the earnest 
                         money... well, let them bring it up 
                         if they notice it at the final walk 
                         through. Right, great, sounds good!

               She hangs up and high-fives her colleague. They bear-hug.

                                     COLLEAGUE
                         Great job! I'm proud of ya! Well, 
                         I'll check you guys later. I'm gonna 
                         go start the paperwork.

               Colleague leaves; Dana turns to Seymour.

                                     DANA
                         Hey... so, what brings you down here?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- 
                         there's something I feel I have to 
                         say... I uh, I've never said this to 
                         anyone before -- believe me, I've 
                         stayed in horrible relationships for 
                         years just so I wouldn't have to do 
                         this, but I uh...

                                     DANA
                         What are you trying to say?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just that I feel like it's maybe 
                         not a good idea for us to keep going 
                         out.

               Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment. Suddenly 
               she breaks down sobbing.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I-I honestly never intended for this 
                         to happen...

                                     DANA
                         Please tell me it isn't that teenager!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Enid and I were just friends. You 
                         know... we feel comfortable around 
                         each other... she really likes my 
                         old records and...

                                     DANA
                         I can't believe this! I thought at 
                         the very least a guy like you would 
                         never pull this kind of shit on me!

               She starts crying again. Seymour awkwardly tries to comfort 
               her.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Dana, I... um...

               Dana pushes him away violently.

                                     DANA
                         You disgusting pig! You're just an 
                         overgrown baby who can't deal with a 
                         woman your own age. You pathetic 
                         weakling! You make me sick!

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - THE SAME DAY

               Enid is now utterly defeated. The phone rings. She lets the 
               machine pick it up. Maxine enters.

                                     MAXINE
                         May I ask what you're doing?

                                     ENID
                         Shhh!

                                     MAXINE
                         I want to know what you think you're 
                         doing, staying out all night and 
                         worrying your father to death!

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah, like he even noticed.

                                     MAXINE
                         Listen, young lady... I know you 
                         don't like me -- I don't really care 
                         whether you do or not -- but I will 
                         not allow you to treat your father 
                         the way you do.

               We hear Seymour on the machine in the background...

                                     SEYMOUR (V.O.)
                         I really want to talk to you. I've 
                         been thinking about what you said 
                         about moving in here...

                                     ENID
                         I can treat him any way I want to - 
                         I'm an adult! Leave me alone!

               Maxine leaves. Seymour finishes his message. Enid picks up 
               the phone and dials.

                                     REBECCA (V.O.)
                         Hello?

                                     ENID
                         I need to talk to you.

               INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca sit at a table. Rebecca is wearing her uniform.

                                     ENID
                         I'm sorry about the other day. I 
                         don't know what's wrong with me...  
                         I really do want to move in with 
                         you.

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know... I was thinking maybe 
                         I should live alone. I decided to 
                         rent that place we looked at. I'm 
                         moving in next week.

                                     ENID
                         Please let me come with you. Please 
                         please please...

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know - I'm not sure it's a 
                         good idea.

                                     ENID
                         Of course it's a good idea... it's 
                         our plan.

                                     REBECCA
                         But how are you gonna pay rent and 
                         everything? You don't even have a 
                         job.

                                     ENID
                         I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise.  
                         If I don't, you can totally tell me 
                         to fuck off.

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE MORNING

               Enid is putting on her shoes. Her Dad opens the door slightly 
               and sticks his head in.

                                     DAD
                         Pumpkin, are you in there?

                                     ENID
                         Are you going to yell at me?

                                     DAD
                         About what?

                                     DAD
                         Yeah, I heard about that.

                                     ENID
                         I was in a horrible mood - tell her 
                         not to worry, I'll be completely out 
                         of her life in a few days.

                                     DAD
                         She understands what you're going 
                         through and she really wants to help 
                         you. She says that job at Computer 
                         Station is still available if you 
                         want it.

                                     ENID
                         I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.

                                     DAD
                         Actually, I was just checking to see 
                         if you were here - your friend Seymour 
                         is on his way up.

                                     ENID
                         What do you mean "on his way up"!?

                                     DAD
                         I just buzzed him in.

               Just then, three sharp KNOCKS on the front door.

                                     ENID
                         What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm 
                         not here!

                                     DAD
                         But I can't --

                                     ENID
                         JUST DO IT!

               Dad goes to answer the door. Enid hides in her room.

                                     DAD (V.O.)
                         I'm not sure when she'll be back...

               Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She 
               has a terribly sad look on her face.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" 
               telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert 
               plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's 
               answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes.  
               Joe walks by the doorway.

                                     JOE
                         Well, here's where the fun never 
                         stops!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, I'm really, really happy.  
                         Really having a good time.

                                     JOE
                         Still torturing yourself over that 
                         Enid, huh?

               Seymour doesn't answer. He looks away.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Where else am I ever going to find 
                         another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley 
                         records?
                              (pause)
                         She could at least have the decency 
                         to call me back.

                                     JOE
                         Maybe she was just using you to try 
                         and get back at some guy. Who knows?  
                         It could be a million things. It's 
                         wasted time trying to logically figure 
                         out the female brain, that's for 
                         sure.

               Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space.

                                     JOE
                         Maybe she's got another boyfriend.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (bummed out, wants 
                              Joe to stop)
                         Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me 
                         up.

                                     JOE
                              (deadpan)
                         No problem.

               Seymour looks so miserable that even Joe has some compassion 
               for him.

                                     JOE
                         Look at it this way - at least things 
                         can't get any worse.

               Joe leaves. Seymour is left listening to the record.

               INT. COOK'S CHICKEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY.

               Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with 
               many doors on both sides. A door opens and a Tony Robbins-
               ish, 35 year-old MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE sticks his head out.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Seymour! Just the man I want to see. 
                         Step in here for a minute.

               Seymour enters.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Have a seat.

               He plunks down the current issue of THE FREE WEEKLY - it's 
               open to a 1/2 page article on page 8 with the headline "Oh 
               Brother!" and a photo of THE PAINTING being removed.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         What can you tell me about this, 
                         Seymour?

               INT. ENID & REBECCA'S NEW APT.

               Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt 
               and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. She's looking around 
               at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment.

                                     REBECCA
                         So, whaddya think?

                                     ENID
                         It's fine.

                                     REBECCA
                         So where's all your stuff?

               Enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc.

                                     ENID
                         There.

                                     REBECCA
                         That's all you're bringing?

                                     ENID
                         I'm gonna finish packing tonight...  
                         I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.

                                     REBECCA
                         What time?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno...

                                     REBECCA
                         Make sure you're here by noon - we 
                         have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! 
                         I have to show you something else!

               She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a BUILT-IN IRONING 
               BOARD as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen.

                                     REBECCA
                         Isn't this the greatest?

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE EVENING

               Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her 
               closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside 
               are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes 
               one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening 
               to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs 
               mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's 
               the uniform from her job at "Computer Station." She folds 
               it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange 
               fabric.

               INT. ENID AND REBECCA'S APT. - THE NEXT DAY

               Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.

               She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the 
               time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The 
               machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another 
               tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and 
               goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock 
               on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.

                                     REBECCA
                              (as she opens the 
                              door)
                         What's wrong with you, retard - it's 
                         three-thirty!

               It's Seymour standing there, not Enid.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother 
                         told me I'd find her here?

                                     REBECCA
                         She's not at home?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No... they said she was here...

                                     REBECCA
                         What the fuck is she doing?! She was 
                         supposed to be here three hours ago!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really 
                         need to talk to her.

                                     REBECCA
                              (allows him to step 
                              inside but leaves 
                              the door open)
                         Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe 
                         she was just hiding from you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Why would she be hiding from me?

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know... where is she, then?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Maybe she's with Josh?

                                     REBECCA
                         Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't know.

                                     REBECCA
                         Why? What did she tell you?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         She just mentioned him a few times 
                         and said that they had been dating - 
                         I thought maybe she was...

                                     REBECCA
                         What? Is she having some secret affair 
                         with Josh?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I have no idea - I just want to...

                                     REBECCA
                         Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no 
                         way! She could never keep that to 
                         herself... you're crazy.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Really, I don't know enough about it 
                         to...

                                     REBECCA
                         That slut!

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (changing subject 
                              back to me)
                         Why did you say she might be hiding 
                         from me? Did she say anything to you 
                         about me?

                                     REBECCA
                              (getting revenge on 
                              Seymour)
                         Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Did she say that?

                                     REBECCA
                         Look, what do you expect?  Considering 
                         how we met you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What do you mean?

                                     REBECCA
                         On that pathetic fake blind date.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What are you talking about?

                                     REBECCA
                         Didn't she ever tell you about that? 
                         God, she really is pathological...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What fake blind date? What are you 
                         talking about?

               Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box 
               and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she 
               hands it to Seymour.

                                     REBECCA
                         Here. Read it and weep.

               We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR 
               in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH 
               with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.

               EXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON

               Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into 
               the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.

               INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON

               Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, 
               with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is 
               over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I hope you had a good laugh at my 
                         expense.

               Josh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour.

                                     JOSH
                         Huh... oh... hi... uh...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You want to see something funny?  
                         I'll show you something funny!

               As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato 
               chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front 
               of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying 
               and gets more and more frustrated.

                                     JOSH
                         HEY!

               Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he 
               creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get 
               into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling.  
               Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with 
               his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked 
               out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.

               The Boss comes out of the back room...

                                     BOSS
                         Josh! What going on here?!

               INT. ENID & REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT

               The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying 
               streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, 
               exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud 
               radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she 
               checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one 
               last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP 
               of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.

               She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a 
               cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over 
               her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

                            TITLE CARD: "SEVERAL MONTHS LATER"

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

               The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades. 
               We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel 
               psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his THERAPIST, a 
               handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I have to admit, things have really 
                         started looking up for me since my 
                         life turned to shit.

                                     THERAPIST
                         So tell me more about this job.  
                         What exactly will you be doing?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well, mostly archival research, 
                         cataloguing old records and writing 
                         liner notes for their CD reissues.  
                         It's really... I can't believe it.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Remember what I said when we first 
                         started -- this little breakdown 
                         might turn out to be the best thing 
                         that ever happened to you!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It doesn't pay very much, but I should 
                         be able to afford my own place in a 
                         few months... Do you think that's 
                         too soon? I'm really anxious to get 
                         my record collection out of storage...

                                     THERAPIST
                         Why don't we start with that next 
                         week?

               Seymour looks up. She nods toward the large wall clock behind 
               her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him 
               slowly toward the door.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Thank you, doctor.

                                     THERAPIST
                              (as she opens the 
                              door)
                         Don't thank me. You're doing all the 
                         work.

               A pause. They stand facing each other.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Seymour?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yes?

                                     THERAPIST
                         Do you have a check for me?

               Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In 
               the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.

                                     MOTHER
                         Seymour? Are you done? Did you have 
                         a chance to think about what you 
                         might want for dinner while you were 
                         in there?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         We can talk about it in the car, 
                         Ma...

               As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the 
               doctor.

               INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville 
               more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood 
               "characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We 
               see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a 
               check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted 
               EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his 
               POWERBOOK to notice.

               She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her 
               receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's 
               style clothes, sitting across from her.

                                     ENID
                         Hi.

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize 
                         you -- I think I need to get glasses; 
                         you're all blurry!

                                     ENID
                              (nodding toward 
                              muscular HIPSTER)
                         You're lucky then, you can't see the 
                         veins on that guy's biceps.

                                     REBECCA
                         Actually, he's a really nice guy.

               We see at this point that Rebecca & Enid are no longer 
               friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you want anything?

                                     ENID
                         Maybe an orange juice.

               Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and 
               saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.

                                     ENID
                         Hey, look what I got...

               She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out 
               her DIPLOMA.

                                     REBECCA
                         Wow... finally.

                                     ENID
                         It just came yesterday...

               Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.

                                     JOSH
                         Hi Enid.

                                     ENID
                         Hey Josh.

                                     JOSH
                         Are you ready to go?

               For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:

                                     REBECCA
                              (still counting 
                              receipts)
                         Yeah, just one second...

               She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind 
               the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.

                                     REBECCA
                              (to Josh)
                         Did you remember to pay the phone 
                         bill?

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah.

                                     REBECCA
                              (to Enid)
                         Call me sometime.

                                     ENID
                         Definitely. We still have to go to 
                         that shoe store sometime.

               Rebecca & Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien 
               world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly 
               stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL 
               BAG at her feet.

               EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING

               We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.

               It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.

               She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It 
               looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands 
               right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered 
               over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: 
               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a 
               FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming 
               Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.

               EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING

               She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm 
               stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by 
               her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She 
               stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect 
               for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the 
               glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.

               She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she 
               has the street all to herself.

               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT

               We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She 
               looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman 
               who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing 
               her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing 
               happens in another window down the street... then another...  
               Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the 
               corner and heads toward her.

               From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus 
               as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment 
               later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves 
               upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the 
               credits roll.

               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

               The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.

                                         THE END

               OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING

               We MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that 
               define and establish our setting, from commercial district 
               to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves 
               moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many 
               of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. 
               As we track past at window-level we see:

               A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER 
               runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..

               An empty room...

               A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, 
               watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed 
               potatoes with his fingers...

               A dazed old woman staring out the window.

               The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.

               We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the 
               THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production 
               number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of 
               clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted 
               back as she dances along to the video while trying on a 
               GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY.

               A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner 
               with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY

               A graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland 
               faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, 
               we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her 
               head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.

               She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is 
               also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an 
               elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.

                                     SPEAKER
                         High school is like the training 
                         wheels for the bicycle of real life.  
                         It is a time for young people to 
                         explore different fields of interest 
                         and to hopefully grow from their 
                         experiences.  After all, that which 
                         we learn from our mistakes can be as 
                         valuable as what we learn from our 
                         textbooks, and often we can turn the 
                         negative experiences that are common 
                         to all high-schoolers into positive 
                         steps toward personal growth and 
                         achievement. In coming to terms with 
                         my own personal setback, which I'm 
                         sure you've all heard about, I've 
                         been able to learn a lot about myself. 
                         I've learned for one thing that I 
                         don't need to rely on drugs and 
                         alcohol
                              (APPLAUSE)
                         and that I'm very lucky-that more 
                         people besides Carrie and myself 
                         weren't hurt in the accident; I've 
                         learned that I'm blessed with 
                         wonderful parents, teachers and above 
                         all the best classmates in the world -- 
                         I love each and every one of you 
                         guys!!
                              (APPLAUSE)
                         and I've learned that to get through 
                         life's obstacles you need faith, 
                         hope and, most of all, a sense of 
                         humor.
                              (BIG APPLAUSE)

               A trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black) 
               come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping. 
               The audience loves them.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATE AFTERNOON

               The auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid & Rebecca 
               run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up 
               diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly 
               bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.

               Enid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE 
               FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath.

                                     ENID
                         God, what a bunch of retards...

                                     REBECCA
                         I thought Chipmunk-face was never 
                         going to shut up.

                                     ENID
                         I know, I liked her better when she 
                         was an alcoholic crack addict! She 
                         gets in one car wreck and all of a 
                         sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and 
                         everybody loves her.

                                     REBECCA
                         It's totally sickening.
                              (she unrolls her 
                              DIPLOMA)
                         Let's see if they gave me the right 
                         diploma...

               Enid opens hers. Instead of a diploma, it's an OFFICIAL 
               LOOKING DOCUMENT with a pink Post-It note on the front page.

                                     ENID
                         What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!

                                     REBECCA
                         What?

                                     ENID
                         These assholes are saying that I 
                         have to go to Summer school and take 
                         some stupid art class!

                                     REBECCA
                         Why?

                                     ENID
                         Remember that stupid hippie art 
                         teacher who failed me sophomore year?  
                         I didn't think that just because you 
                         get an "F" that means you have to 
                         take the class over again.

                                     REBECCA
                         You loser.

               EXT. "DAYS INN" HOTEL - EVENING

               The sign reads "Welcome Graduates".

               INT. "DAYS INN" HOTEL - EVENING

               Party in progress in the "Gold Room". A band plays TOP-40 
               "lite" rock

                                     REBECCA
                              (watching band)
                         This is so bad, it's almost good.

                                     ENID
                         This is so bad it's gone past good 
                         and back to bad again...

               CLOSE-UP ON ENID, we see the party from her POV: The six or 
               seven MOST POPULAR STUDENTS huddle closely together.

                                     ENID
                         Just think, we'll never have to see 
                         any of these creepy faces ever again.

                                     REBECCA
                         Unless they're in your Summer school 
                         class!

                                     ENID
                         Shut up!

                                     REBECCA
                         Uh oh... don't turn around...

                                     ENID
                         What? Why?

                                     REBECCA
                         Forget it...

               MELORRA, an ambitious, incessantly upbeat classmate, 
               approaches them.

                                     MELORRA
                         Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe 
                         we made it!

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, we graduated high school -- 
                         how totally amazing.

                                     MELORRA
                         So what are you guys doing this 
                         Summer?

                                     ENID
                         Nothing.

                                     MELORRA
                         I'm going to be in this actor's 
                         workshop, and I'm hoping to start 
                         going on auditions soon. I'm so 
                         excited to finally have some free 
                         time. We have to get together this 
                         summer!

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...

                                     MELORRA
                              (spotting better people 
                              to talk to)
                         Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!

               Melorra leaves.

                                     ENID
                         Since when is she an "actress"?

                                     REBECCA
                         I know, she needs to die immediately.

               TODD, a friendly but slightly below-average-looking guy, 
               approaches from behind.

                                     TODD
                         Hey Rebecca!

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh... hi...

                              (pause)
                         So... we finally --

                                     ENID
                         What about me? Am I not even here?

                                     TODD
                         Oh, hey Enid...
                              (starting over)
                         So... we finally made it!

                                     REBECCA
                         Yep.

                                     TODD
                              (awkward pause)
                         So... where are you going to college?

                                     ENID
                              (before Rebecca can 
                              answer)
                         We're not.

                                     TODD
                         Really? Both of you?... Why not?

                                     ENID
                         Just because.

                                     REBECCA
                         We have other plans.

                                     TODD
                         I guess I should have figured that 
                         you two would do something different.

                                     ENID
                         What are you going to be when you 
                         grow up, Todd?

                                     TODD
                         Well I'm going to major in Business 
                         Administration and, I think, minor 
                         in Communications.

                                     ENID
                         See, that's exactly the kind of thing 
                         we're trying to avoid.
                              (pause)

               Todd starts to talk again but Enid has noticed something off 
               to the side.

                                     TODD
                         So... I --

               Enid grabs Rebecca and turns her away from Todd before he 
               can finish his sentence.

                                     ENID
                         Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler 
                         going out with Rod Harbaugh?

                                     REBECCA
                         How perfect.

                                     ENID
                         He better watch out or he'll get 
                         AIDS when he date-rapes her.

               Todd, forgotten, walks away. The singer wails a sappy, maudlin 
               ballad. Enid spots DENNIS, the class loser, wandering around 
               by himself.

                                     ENID
                         God, just think, we'll never see 
                         Dennis again.

                                     REBECCA
                         Good.

                                     ENID
                         God, think about that... that's 
                         actually totally depressing.

               INT. THE QUALITY CAFE - DAY

               The QUALITY CAFE is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout. A 50-ISH 
               MAN with shaved head, and his VAGUELY DIABOLICAL WIFE sit 
               eating lunch. Enid is drawing a picture of them in her 
               sketchbook when Rebecca arrives.

                                     REBECCA
                         Hi.

                                     ENID
                         Look at these people behind you.  
                         I'm totally convinced they're 
                         Satanists.

                                     REBECCA
                         Why?

                                     ENID
                         Just look at them!

               REBECCA turns and makes eye contact with MR. SATANIST. She 
               calmly turns back to face Enid before cracking up.

                                     REBECCA
                         So, when are we going to start looking 
                         for our apartment?

                                     ENID
                         Soon... I have to wait and see how 
                         this Summer class goes.

                                     REBECCA
                         Did you sign up yet?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, I just picked the one that 
                         sounded the easiest.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, it's so weird that we're finally 
                         out of high school... We've been 
                         waiting for this our whole life! Now 
                         we can get our own apartment and do 
                         anything we want.  It's such a weird 
                         feeling.

                                     ENID
                         I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.

               Enter JOHN ELLIS, an obnoxious young man with a perpetual 
               smirk.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, 
                         the little Jewish girl and her Aryan 
                         friend.

                                     ENID
                         You're late, asshole.

                                     JOHN
                         Fine, and how are you?

                                     ENID
                         Did you bring that tape?

               He puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach.

                                     JOHN
                         You never paid me for that tape with 
                         the Indian dance routine.

                                     ENID
                         I did too!

                                     JOHN
                         Tsk! You Jews are so clever with 
                         money...

                                     ENID
                         Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!

                                     REBECCA
                         Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!

                                     ENID
                         We should follow them!

               As the SATANISTS walk outside, they open umbrellas, even 
               though it's a bright, sunny day.

                                     REBECCA
                         Totally... Oh my God, look!

               The girls get up to follow them. Enid grabs the videotape.

                                     ENID
                              (to John)
                         Thanks for the tape - I'll have to 
                         pay you later, I'm broke.

                                     JOHN
                         Hey, where are you going?

                                     ENID
                         Later, "Dude".

                                     REBECCA
                         Much later.

                                     ENID
                         In fact, never.

               EXT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY

               Under harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block 
               behind the SATANISTS.

                                     REBECCA
                         What do you do if you're a satanist, 
                         anyway?

                                     ENID
                         You know, sacrifice virgins and 
                         stuff...

                                     REBECCA
                         That lets us off the hook.

               EXT. ACROSS FROM WOWSVILLE - TEN MINUTES HAVE PASSED

               The SATANISTS continue slowly along with Enid & Rebecca still 
               following.

                                     ENID
                         Maybe there's some weird secret 
                         satanic society that meets at the 
                         Quality Cafe and all of the other 
                         regular customers are in on it except 
                         for us.

                                     REBECCA
                         Or maybe not.

                                     ENID
                         Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or 
                         they're planning to brainwash us and --

                                     REBECCA
                         Okay, okay!

               EXT. WOWSVILLE DINER - CONTINUOUS

                                     ENID
                         Hey, look at this...

               Enid points at the mini-mall in front of them. A new 
               restaurant - we see their banner: "GRAND OPENING. WOWSVILLE - 
               THE AUTHENTIC 50'S DINER".

                                     ENID
                         "Authentic 50's diner"? Since when 
                         were there mini-malls in the 1950's?

                                     REBECCA
                         God, it's so totally pathetic.

               INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - DAY

               They're in a booth looking at menus. It's a less accurate 
               version of "Johnny Rockets". A golden oldie from the 80's 
               plays on the jukebox.

                                     REBECCA
                         Who can forget this great hit from 
                         the 50's?

                                     ENID
                         I feel as though I've stepped into a 
                         time warp!

               The WAITER approaches. He has an ostentatious 70's-style 
               perm.

                                     REBECCA
                         Check out the awesome "fifties" hairdo 
                         on the waiter.

                                     WAITER
                         Hi, my name is Allen, and I'll be 
                         your waiter this afternoon.

                                     ENID
                         Hi, Al!

                                     REBECCA
                         Can we call you "Weird Al"?

                                     WAITER
                         Heh heh. Our specials today are pasta 
                         Vasilio, which is a pasta salad with 
                         a light basil vinaigrette--

                                     ENID
                         That was a popular dish in the 50's, 
                         huh Weird Al?

                                     AL
                         I imagine so! Also, we have a spinach 
                         tortellini in a ricotta sauce. Both 
                         of those are $6.95... shall I give 
                         you a few minutes to mull it over?

                                     ENID
                         I just want an order of onion rings.

                                     REBECCA
                         I might actually get the pasta 
                         special.

                                     ENID
                         You loser!

                                     AL
                         Pasta special and an order of onion 
                         rings. Very good.

               Al leaves.

                                     ENID
                         Did you notice all those weird things 
                         on the menu? Like "The Salad 
                         Explosion"?

                                     REBECCA
                         I know... and instead of "dessert" 
                         it says "Mindbenders."

                                     ENID
                         What does that even mean?

               INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - TEN MINUTES LATER

               Enid spots an abandoned newspaper, THE FREE WEEKLY, on the 
               adjoining table.

                                     REBECCA
                         Check out the Personals... maybe our 
                         future husbands are trying to contact 
                         us.

                                     ENID
                         God, this paper is so boring. Who 
                         reads all this shit?
                              (flips through it 
                              until she gets to 
                              the Personals)
                         Here we go...
                              (reading)
                         "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, 
                         maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the 
                         clubs, make each other laugh!"

                                     REBECCA
                         You can have that one.

                                     ENID
                         Okay, well here's yours...
                              (reading)
                         "Who said all the most eligible

                                     REBECCA
                         Gross.

               Al returns with their food.

                                     AL
                         Can I get you ladies anything else, 
                         or are you all set?

                                     ENID
                         Later I might be interested in one 
                         of those far-out "mindbenders."

               Al leaves. Enid goes back to the paper.

                                     ENID
                         Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you 
                         remember me? Airport shuttle, June 
                         7th. You: striking redhead with yellow 
                         dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. 
                         I was the bookish fellow in the green 
                         cardigan who helped you find your 
                         contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we 
                         have a moment?"

                                     REBECCA
                         God, that's so pathetic. I bet she 
                         didn't even notice him.

                                     ENID
                         I know. And he's like psychotically 
                         obsessing over every little detail.

                                     REBECCA
                         We should call him and pretend to be 
                         the redhead.

                                     ENID
                         Oh, we totally have to.

               Enid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook.

               CU of sketchbook.

               INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

               Enid and Rebecca sit with Rebecca's grandmother OOMIE in her 
               living room. They eat TV dinners while watching Oomie's 
               favorite TV SHOW, which we hear but don't see.

                                     NASAL-VOICED GIRL (V.O.)
                         So what happened next, Donna?

                                     DONNA (DUMB BLONDE'S V.O.)
                         Then I told him he'd better take out 
                         his hose and pump me!

                                     NASAL-VOICED GIRL/ANOTHER GIRL (V.O.)
                         Don-na?!

                                     DONNA (V.O.)
                         You guys! My car was out of gas!

               LAUGH TRACK. Enid leans toward Rebecca.

                                     ENID
                              (whispers)
                         Does Oomie really like this show?

                                     REBECCA
                              (whispers)
                         Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.

                                     OOMIE
                         Girls! Shh!

               Enid and Rebecca exit.

               INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING

               Rebecca looks through Enid's sketchbook while Enid fiddles 
               with the remote, fast-forwarding through a tape in the VCR.

                                     REBECCA
                         So what should we do?

                                     ENID
                         Wait... I just want to see what's on 
                         this tape.

                                     REBECCA
                         What is this?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno. John Ellis always puts on 
                         all this sick stuff that I have to 
                         fast-forward past to get to the good 
                         stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don 
                         Knotts movie on here someplace.

               Sound of FAST-FORWARDING. Rebecca glances up from the 
               sketchbook.

                                     REBECCA
                         Wait, what is that?

               Enid stops fast-forwarding. We don't see the screen but we 
               hear weird sounds like BOOTS WALKING THROUGH DEEP MUD.

                                     ENID & REBECCA
                         EEEEWWWW!

               Enid lurches forward to avert her gaze. She clicks off the 
               VCR, but leaves the TV on. She notices a PHOTO ALBUM on a 
               bookshelf under the television.

                                     ENID
                         Hey - why do you have this?

                                     REBECCA
                         You lent it to me in like tenth grade.

                                     ENID
                         I've been looking all over for this.

               ANGLE ON ALBUM as she leafs through it. We see a picture of 
               a FIVE-YEAR-OLD ENID with glasses.

                                     ENID
                         Look at how cute I am!

                                     REBECCA
                         What a little hosebag.

               ANGLE ON PHOTO of ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD ENID & REBECCA at a party.

                                     ENID
                         Look, that's back when I hated you.

                                     REBECCA
                         I remember every minute of that party.

                                     ENID
                              (another page)
                         There's my dad with Joanie.

                                     REBECCA
                         I can never keep them all straight - 
                         was she the super-bitch?

                                     ENID
                         No, she was the second wife. The 
                         third one was the super-bitch - 
                         Maxine.
                              (finds a picture)
                         There! Look at her!

               ANGLE ON PHOTO of MAXINE.

                                     ENID
                         What a fucking monster!

               Something on TV catches Rebecca's eye.

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my God! This is that comedian I 
                         was telling you about! You have to 
                         see this guy -- he's the absolute 
                         worst!

               A dead-pan comedian, JOEY McCOBB, is doing his stand-up 
               routine in a standard brick-wall comedy venue. He has a 
               contrived "I'm a weirdo" shtick.

                                     JOEY
                         Just because I live with my mother 
                         people think I'm peculiar... so what 
                         if she's been dead for fifteen years! 
                         Hehn hehn...
                              (Peter Lorre laugh)

                                     REBECCA (V.O.)
                         God, that's barely even a joke.

                                     JOEY
                         As I always say, take my life... 
                         please!

                                     ENID (V.O.)
                         If he's supposed to be so weird, how 
                         come he's wearing Nikes?

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Joey McCobb, ladies and gentlemen... 
                         Joey McCobb!
                              (APPLAUSE)

                                     ENID
                         Joey McCobb is our God.

                                     REBECCA
                         I want to do him!

                                     ENID
                         I bet! Actually he reminds me of 
                         that one creep you went out with -- 
                         you always go for guys with some 
                         lame, fake shtick.

                                     REBECCA
                         What are you talking about -- who?

                                     ENID
                         That Larry guy -- what look was he 
                         going for? A gay tennis player from 
                         the forties?

                                     REBECCA
                         Fuck you!

               Rebecca turns the page of Enid's sketchbook to the torn-out 
               personal ad.

                                     REBECCA
                         Hey! We forgot to call the loser!

                                     ENID
                         Which loser?

                                     REBECCA
                         You know, the green cardigan guy.

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah.

               Rebecca goes to the phone and offers the receiver.

                                     REBECCA
                         You call.

                                     ENID
                         Why do I always have to do it?

                                     REBECCA
                         You're better at it.

                                     ENID
                              (as she dials)
                         I remember when I first started 
                         reading these I thought DWF stood 
                         for "dwarf!"

                                     REBECCA
                              (ear up to phone)
                         What does it stand for?

                                     ENID
                         Shh, it's his answering machine...
                              (pause)
                         We hear the indistinct traces of a 
                         musical message followed by a faint 
                         BEEP.

                                     ENID
                         Hi, it's me - your "striking blonde." 
                         Of course I remember you.  Let's get 
                         together for lunch sometime... How 
                         about Friday at one o'clock?... Why 
                         don't you meet me at my favorite 
                         restaurant, "Wowsville"... It's in 
                         the mall on Century Parkway... I'll 
                         see you there, darling... and be 
                         sure to wear that sexy green 
                         cardigan...

               As Enid hangs up they both start laughing.

               EXT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

               A franchise convenience store with a western motif.

               INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

               JOSH, 19, is taking his apron off as his BOSS, a humorless 
               Greek immigrant, counts out the cash register. Cheerful Muzak 
               plays.

                                     BOSS
                         AH AH AH! What you think you doing?  
                         You still got five minutes left on 
                         you shift!

               Enid (wearing wraparound shades) & Rebecca enter.

                                     ENID
                         Well hello there, young employee of 
                         the Sidewinder.

                                     JOSH
                         Look, I already told you I'm not 
                         going to give you a ride.

                                     ENID
                         What can you tell me, young man, 
                         about the various flavors of "frozen 
                         yogurt"?

                                     JOSH
                         Look, I'll be done in a minute.  
                         Just wait outside.

                                     ENID
                         I'm afraid I don't understand. I 
                         simply wish to know --

                                     BOSS
                         JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?

                                     JOSH
                              (SIGHS)
                         The flavors we're featuring this 
                         week, in addition to old favorites 
                         chocolate and vanilla, are Six-Gun 
                         Strawberry, Wild Cherry Round-up, 
                         and Ten Gallon Tangerine.

                                     ENID
                         I don't believe I care for any of 
                         those.

               Rebecca giggles. A customer, DOUG, enters: a lowly specimen 
               with bad hair-cut, mustache, and jail-house tattoos, wearing 
               filthy designer jeans and no shirt.

                                     DOUG
                         Hey, Josh... I need two packs of 
                         smokes. I'm on a double shift 
                         tonight... fuckin' sixteen hours, 
                         man.

               Doug brings a 40-ouncer to the counter. Josh has two packs 
               of Newports waiting for him.

                                     DOUG
                         Hey, and gimme six of these beef 
                         jerkys too - I'm hungry enough to 
                         chew the crotch out of a rag doll!

               Doug pays.

                                     BOSS
                         Hey! I told you: No shirt, no service!

                                     DOUG
                              (as he leaves)
                         Fuck you, man!

                                     ENID
                         So Josh...

                                     JOSH
                         Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm 
                         almost done.

               Enid looks at herself in the security mirror. She takes off 
               her hat and messes up her hair. She then takes off her shades 
               and replaces them with her standard horn-rims.

                                     REBECCA
                              (nudging Enid, points 
                              outside)
                         Look at this!

               Outside we see Doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a 
               beer. Heavy metal music blares from his car radio. The BOSS 
               sees this and goes out to yell at him.

                                     BOSS
                         You get out of here!

               Josh joins Enid & Rebecca on the other side of counter.

                                     ENID
                         That guy rules!

                                     JOSH
                         Who, Doug? He spends more time here 
                         than I do...

                                     ENID
                         So Josh, will you give us a ride?  
                         Please? Pretty please? It's going to 
                         be super fun!

                                     JOSH
                         No.

                                     REBECCA
                         Please Josh?

                                     JOSH
                         Forget it, there's no way... find 
                         some other poor sucker to abuse.

               EXT. JOSH'S CAR - DAY

               Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing 
               in the back seat.

                                     JOSH
                         Why do you even need a ride? You 
                         could walk there in two minutes.

                                     ENID
                         It's just an excuse for us to spend 
                         time with you.

               Enid and Rebecca giggle.

                                     REBECCA
                         So Josh, if this guy freaks out, 
                         will you protect us?

                                     JOSH
                         He has every reason to freak out -- 
                         this is a totally fucked-up thing to 
                         do to somebody!

                                     ENID
                         God, I think Josh is too mature for 
                         us.

                                     REBECCA
                         I know, look at the way he drives... 
                         he's like an old man.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!

               EXT. GAFFEY STREET - DAY

               Their car accelerates.

               INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - 12:35 PM.

               The three of them are seated at a corner booth. A song from 
               any decade other than the 50's PLAYS on the jukebox. A 
               BUSINESSMAN enters.

                                     REBECCA
                         Look, maybe that's him!

                                     ENID
                         It's still twenty-five minutes early.

                                     JOSH
                         Aren't there a million places like 
                         this?

                                     ENID
                         This is the ultimate. It's like the 
                         Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.

                                     JOSH
                         So, where's "Weird Al"?

                                     ENID
                         SHH! He's back there. I can see his 
                         hair bobbing up and down.

                                     REBECCA
                         I want to "make love" to him.

                                     ENID
                         I'm going to tell him you said that.

               WEIRD AL approaches with menus.

                                     AL
                         So nice to see you again, ladies.

                                     ENID
                         Hey, Weird Al, there's something my 
                         friend wants to tell you --

                                     REBECCA
                         SHUT UP!

                                     ENID
                         She says she wants to MMPH!

               Rebecca puts her hand over Enid's mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A PUSH SWEEPER, SWEEPING THE CARPET.

               ANGLE ON: OLD WOMAN slowly sweeping.

               WE FOLLOW HER BACK TO: Enid, Rebecca & Josh. They're now 
               eating: ten minutes have passed, it's 12:45.

                                     ENID
                         So Josh... Becky and I are trying to 
                         figure out what makes you tick.  
                         Tell us about your political beliefs.

               REBECCA laughs.

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, right.

                                     ENID
                         No, I'm serious. Give us your whole 
                         basic philosophy in a nutshell.

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my God, look, that's got to be 
                         him!

               A GUY enters.

                                     ENID
                         Is he wearing a green cardigan?

                                     REBECCA
                         What exactly is a cardigan anyway?

               The GUY joins a friend.

                                     ENID
                         That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking 
                         me out.

                                     JOSH
                         In answer to your question, I suppose 
                         I endorse policies that are opposed 
                         to stupidity and violence and cruelty 
                         in any form...

                                     ENID
                         I figured something like that...

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my God!

               They see a somewhat funny-looking guy in his late 30's, 
               wearing a green cardigan, SEYMOUR, enter. Enid and Rebecca 
               hunch down in their seats.

                                     ENID
                         It's obviously him!

                                     REBECCA
                         I can't believe it!

               Seymour sits down and looks around. Weird Al brings a menu.

               ANOTHER ANGLE ON: WEIRD AL bringing his milkshake. Ten more 
               minutes have passed, it's 12:55.

                                     REBECCA
                         What's going on now? What's he doing?

                                     ENID
                         Oh my god, he just ordered a giant 
                         glass of milk!

                                     JOSH
                              (bursting her bubble)
                         It's a vanilla milkshake.

               Fifteen more minutes have passed - it's 1:10 PM. Seymour 
               looks around, still hopeful. His date is now TEN MINUTES 
               LATE.

                                     REBECCA
                         What's he doing now?

                                     ENID
                         He's still just sitting there. God, 
                         this is totally unbearable!

                                     JOSH
                         I agree.

                                     REBECCA
                         I wish I could see him.

                                     ENID
                         Go ahead and look, but don't make it 
                         too obvious...

               Rebecca turns around and pretends to look past Seymour.

               It's now 1:30 PM. His date is 30 MINUTES LATE. Seymour gets 
               up and walks sadly towards the cashier (Weird Al).

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you think he knows?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno...

               They watch him leave. Enid goes up to pay the bill while 
               Josh and Rebecca go outside.

                                     ENID
                         Hey Weird Al, did that guy say 
                         anything to you before he left?

                                     AL
                         Not a thing.

               Enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars. Al 
               passes behind her.

                                     AL
                              (cheerfully 
                              professional despite 
                              her abuse)
                         Thank you and come again.

               Enid hesitates, overcome with guilt. She glances back at Al, 
               then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars 
               in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip.

               EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

               The trio drive in silence. Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up 
               vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver (SEYMOUR) next to 
               him. SEYMOUR bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities.

                                     JOSH
                         Jesus, look at this guy.

                                     ENID
                         Oh my God, that's HIM!

                                     REBECCA
                         Are you sure?

                                     ENID
                         Totally! Look!

               ANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of 
               his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face.

                                     ENID
                         He's insane!

                                     REBECCA
                         We should follow him home.

                                     JOSH
                         Forget it.

                                     ENID
                         Come on, Josh... don't you want to 
                         see where he lives?

                                     JOSH
                         No.

                                     ENID
                         But this guy is like a one-of-kind, 
                         rare butterfly, and we have to follow 
                         him back to his natural habitat...

                                     JOSH
                         You need counseling.

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Several minutes have passed. Seymour parks.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, he lives right in our 
                         neighborhood!

               Seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building.

                                     ENID
                         He doesn't even look that bummed 
                         out, really.

                                     REBECCA
                         I know... wouldn't you be totally 
                         pissed off?

                                     ENID
                         This kind of thing must happen to 
                         him all the time.

               INT. EXPERIMENTAL FILM - DAY

               FULL SCREEN: grainy B&W video footage. The CAMERA travels up 
               a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic 
               POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR ("LALALALALALA").

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                              (cheap echo effect)
                         Returning to the house of my 
                         Fatherfatherfatherfather...

               The CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that 
               slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's 
               decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We 
               HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little 
               girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll 
               and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now 
               mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around.

               We see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily 
               picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END.  A 
               FILM BY ROBERTA ALLSWORTH.

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               The lights go on, the VIDEO ends and the monitor is shut 
               off.

               There are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old 
               boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl 
               outfit. The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class.

                                     ROBERTA
                         That piece is entitled 
                         "Mirror/Father/Mirror." I like to 
                         show it to people I'm meeting for 
                         the first time because it says so 
                         much about who I am and what it feels 
                         like to inhabit my specific skin.  
                         And this is exactly what I'm hoping 
                         to get from each of you over the 
                         course of this Summer: a picture of 
                         your own self-exploration. My own 
                         background is in video and performance 
                         art, but I'm hoping that doesn't 
                         influence you and that you'll find 
                         your own ways of externalizing the 
                         internal. At the end of the Summer, 
                         this class has been invited, along 
                         with several others in the area, to 
                         participate in a show of High-School 
                         art at the Neighborhood Activity 
                         Center. The title of the show will 
                         be "Brotherhood and Community: Art 
                         as Dialogue." I think the 
                         "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely 
                         with the theme of self-discovery 
                         that I'd like to emphasize in this 
                         class. Are there any questions so 
                         far?
                              (she's completely 
                              lost them)
                         Great...

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               Enid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment.

                                     ENID
                         This is way too creepy.

                                     REBECCA
                         He won't see us... we'll just stalk 
                         him from a distance.

                                     ENID
                         I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start 
                         feeling really bad again.

               A pause.

                                     ENID
                         So what should we do? We can't just 
                         hide all day waiting for him to come 
                         out...

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S BUILDING - MAILBOX

               There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the 
               first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME 
               JOURNAL.

                                     ENID
                         This is girl mail.

               She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO.

                                     ENID
                         This is all computer catalogues and 
                         stuff...

               Rebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE.

                                     REBECCA
                         The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...
                              (she flips through 
                              the mail)
                         Oh my God, The National Psoriasis 
                         Foundation!

                                     ENID
                         Bingo!

               She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs 
               the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner.

                                     REBECCA
                         Wait! Do you hear that?

               Enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic.

                                     ENID
                         Shit!

               They slowly walk around the bushes toward the voices.

               INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

               They see the GARAGE SALE, in progress. They've all spotted 
               each other.

                                     REBECCA
                         What should we do? What if he 
                         recognizes us?

                                     ENID
                         Come on, it's too late now...

               A middle-aged HOUSEWIFE browses with little enthusiasm as 
               Enid & Rebecca tentatively approach. Enid spots a MONGOOSE 
               VS. COBRA taxidermy piece near Joe...

                                     ENID
                         Ew, look at this...

                                     REBECCA
                         Gross!

                                     ENID
                         I think it's cute - look at his little 
                         weasel teeth.

                                     REBECCA
                         Ew, it's like some gross rat...

                                     JOE
                              (hardly looking up 
                              from TV)
                         It's a mongoose.

                                     REBECCA
                         Mm...

                                     ENID
                         A what?

                                     JOE
                         A mongoose... they eat snakes... you 
                         never heard of a mongoose?  That's a 
                         classic piece of vintage taxidermy. 
                         Nobody alive today knows how to do 
                         work like that.

                                     ENID
                              (looking underneath 
                              it)
                         How much is this?

                                     JOE
                         Umm... That's not officially for 
                         sale... I might have to hang onto 
                         that for the time being.

               Joe shuts off the TV. He turns to the girls, not wanting to 
               lose the rapport he's established with two potential 
               customers.

                                     JOE
                         So, are you looking for anything in 
                         particular? There's a lot of other 
                         stuff in storage...

               He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's 
               toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks.

                                     JOE
                         Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to 
                         you.  Absolutely no practice 
                         necessary.  You shread like a giant. 
                         Just press a button.

                                     ENID
                         That's okay...

               She notices several modern jazz LPs on Joe's table.

                                     ENID
                         Do you have any other old records 
                         besides these?

                                     JOE
                         Seymour does.

                                     ENID
                         Who does?

                                     JOE
                         Him. Seymour. He's the man with the 
                         records.

               Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name: 
               "Seymour?!" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter, 
               and turns away from the table. Enid keeps her cool...

                                     ENID
                         Do you have any old Indian records?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Indian records?

                                     ENID
                         You know, like weird 1960's Indian 
                         rock n' roll music.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't have anything after about 
                         1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from 
                         the twenties in my collection, but 
                         it's not really for sale. I don't 
                         really collect "foreign."

               Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Those are all 78s... Can you play 
                         78s?

                                     ENID
                         Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I 
                         can play regular records...

               He points her to a nearby box of LPs.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         There's some good stuff in here... 
                         do you like old music?

                                     ENID
                         Sure, I guess.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well there's a few choice LPs in 
                         here that re-issue some really great 
                         old blues stuff.

               Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve. Enid gets free and continues 
               looking through the records. She stops on one with an 
               especially wacky cover.

                                     ENID
                         Is this one any good?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Nah, it's not so great. Here's the 
                         one I'd recommend.

               He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, 
               VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         This track alone by Memphis Minnie 
                         is worth about $500 if you have the 
                         original 78. She was one of the 
                         greatest guitar players that ever 
                         lived, and a great singer and 
                         songwriter as well. I know the guy 
                         who owns the original and lent it 
                         for use on this reissue.

                                     ENID
                         Wow!

               Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her.

                                     ENID
                         How much is it?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         A dollar seventy-five.

                                     ENID
                         Okay.

               She pays him.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         If you don't like it bring it back 
                         for a refund. We're here every 
                         Saturday.

               He puts the record into a bag.

                                     ENID
                         I'm sure it's fine.

               INT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca sit in their usual booth. Rebecca is reading 
               THE FREE WEEKLY.

                                     REBECCA
                         That was truly pathetic.

                                     ENID
                         I know... I still can't get over 
                         that his name was "Seymour."

               Rebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS. She 
               takes a pen out of her purse.

                                     REBECCA
                         He was so excited when you bought 
                         that record -- you're a saint!...  
                         God, these apartments are super 
                         expensive...

                                     ENID
                         It was so cute how he had his own 
                         little bags. I thought I was going 
                         to start crying!... Do you think 
                         they're gay?

                                     REBECCA
                         What about the "striking redhead in 
                         the yellow dress"?

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah...

                                     REBECCA
                         He should totally just kill himself... 
                         Hey, here's one
                              (circles it)
                         ...Oh wait...
                              (crosses it out)
                         you have to share it with a non 
                         smoking feminist and her two cats...

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... I kind of like him...  
                         He's the exact opposite of everything 
                         I really hate... In a way he's such 
                         a clueless dork that he's almost 
                         cool...

                                     REBECCA
                         That guy is many things but he 
                         definitely isn't "cool"... This one 
                         would be okay, but there's no 
                         kitchen...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but... you know what I mean.

                                     REBECCA
                         Not really...

                                     ENID
                         Forget it, I can't explain it...

               Awkward silence. Melorra enters.

                                     MELORRA
                         Oh my god, what are you guys doing 
                         here?

                                     ENID
                         What are you doing here, Melorra?

                                     MELORRA
                         My acting workshop is across the 
                         street from here. I'm just on my 
                         break.

                                     ENID
                         Well, we won't keep you.

                                     MELORRA
                         I love this place... it's so - you 
                         know, "funky."

               Enid and Rebecca look at each other.

                                     MELORRA
                         What are you guys up to?

                                     REBECCA
                         We're looking for an apartment.

                                     MELORRA
                         God how cool. Where are you moving?

                                     ENID
                         We're not sure yet, that's why we're 
                         looking.

                                     REBECCA
                         Somewhere downtown.

                                     MELORRA
                         God that's so exciting!
                              (looks at clock)
                         Oops, I should go. Bye you guys!  
                         Call me.

               Melorra leaves quickly.

                                     REBECCA
                         "Funky"?

                                     ENID
                         What, is she black now?

               They watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive 
               "casual" clothes with a fancy backpack.

                                     REBECCA
                         I've been thinking about when we 
                         look for our apartment how we have 
                         to try and convince people that we're 
                         like these totally rich yuppies...

                                     ENID
                         What are you talking about?

                                     REBECCA
                         That's who people want to rent to.  
                         It's a known fact that it's way easier 
                         to get a job and everything if you're 
                         rich... All we have to do is buy a 
                         few semi-expensive outfits and act 
                         like it's no big deal... it'll be 
                         fun.

                                     ENID
                         You just want an excuse to dress 
                         like some stupid fashion model without 
                         me making fun of you.

                                     REBECCA
                         Just promise you'll do it.

                                     ENID
                         Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're 
                         out of your mind.

               INT. ENID'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Loud water running; PUNK ROCK blares from adjoining bedroom 
               as Enid, her head in the sink, sings along, making up her 
               own words. As she straightens INTO FRAME, we see that she's 
               dyed her hair green. She grabs a towel and heads into the 
               bedroom.

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Her DAD enters with a mixing bowl, oblivious to the green 
               hair and loud music.

                                     DAD
                              (over music)
                         Have you seen my blue spatula?

                                     ENID
                         Nope. What are you making, pancakes?

                                     DAD
                         Not if I don't find that goddamn 
                         spatula.

               Dad leaves. Enid messes up her hair in different ways while 
               singing along to the tape and looking at herself in the 
               mirror. Rebecca opens the door and stands in the doorway.

                                     REBECCA
                              (disdainful)
                         When did you do that?

               Enid turns around, startled, but instantly regains helps 
               composure.

                                     ENID
                         What? How long have you been standing 
                         there?

               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/NEAR ACME SHOES - DAY

                                     REBECCA
                         Did you have to buy new hair dye or 
                         did you still have some left over 
                         from eighth grade?

                                     ENID
                         Fuck you, bitch!

               They walk past a sad-looking ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE, in 
               a distinctive old building, that looks as if it's been there 
               forever. They stop and peer through the window.

                                     ENID
                         We still have to go in there sometime.

                                     REBECCA
                         It's always closed...

                                     ENID
                         I bet they have tons of incredible 
                         shoes hidden in the back.

               They continue walking.

                                     ENID
                         Hey look, it's the pants.

               We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk.

                                     REBECCA
                         Where are we going?

                                     ENID
                         Let's go hassle Josh.

                                     REBECCA
                         "Hassle"?

               They see a MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in a shabby threadbare 
               suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop. The rusty 
               sign has a red sticker on it that says "No longer in service."

                                     REBECCA
                         There he is...

                                     ENID
                         As always.

                                     REBECCA
                         Waiting for the bus that never 
                         comes...

                                     ENID
                         I wonder if he's just totally insane 
                         and he really thinks a bus is coming 
                         or --

                                     REBECCA
                         Why don't you ask him.

               Enid sits next to THE MAN. Rebecca stands behind the bench, 
               taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing 
               speculation.

                                     ENID
                         Hi... what's your name?

                                     MAN
                              (looks at watchless 
                              wrist, then down the 
                              street)
                         Norman.

                         ...are you waiting for a bus?

                                     MAN
                         Yes.

                                     ENID
                         I hate to tell you this but they 
                         cancelled this bus line two years 
                         ago... There are no buses on this 
                         street.

                                     MAN
                         You don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

               EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second 
               floor of Josh's building. Enid POUNDS on his pasteboard door; 
               the windows RATTLE with each hollow THUD.

                                     ENID
                         JOSH!

                                     REBECCA
                         JOSH!

                                     ENID & REBECCA
                         JOSH!

                                     ENID
                         He's probably in there jerking off.

                                     REBECCA
                         I'll bet he never jerks off...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like 
                         that.

                                     REBECCA
                         Should we leave a note?

               Enid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer.

                                     ENID
                         Do you have a pen?

               She writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder. "Dear 
               Josh. We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door.  
               Therefore you are gay. Signed, Tiffany and Amber."

                                     REBECCA
                         You're not really going to leave 
                         that are you?

               Enid pushes the note over his doorknob.

               EXT. ENTERING ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY

                                     REBECCA
                         Why are we going here? I hate this 
                         place.

                                     ENID
                         It'll only take a second.

               INT. ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY

               They enter. We see racks of books-with titles like "Make 
               Explosives At Home." Rebecca walks over to the magazine rack.

                         Blow me, doofus!

               John Ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box 
               of books onto the shelves. He stops and looks at Enid.

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Didn't they tell you?

                                     ENID
                         Tell me what?

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Punk rock is over!

                                     ENID
                         I know it's over, asshole, I --

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         If you really want to "fuck up the 
                         system" - you should go to business 
                         school -- that's what I'm gonna do: 
                         get a job at some big corporation 
                         and fuck things up from the inside!

                                     ENID
                         That's not even --

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?

               She wads up a twenty-dollar bill and throws it at him.

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Oh, how "punk."

                                     ENID
                         That tape sucked, by the way!

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         I'm so sorry if you were offended!

               He heads toward the back room with the empty box.

                                     ENID
                         Go die, asshole!

                                     JOHN ELLIS
                         Get a job!

               He exits. Rebecca walks over to Enid.

                                     REBECCA
                         What was that all about?

                                     ENID
                         It's not like I'm some modern Punk 
                         dickhead... It's obviously supposed 
                         to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess 
                         Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get 
                         it!

                                     REBECCA
                         I didn't get it either.

                                     ENID
                         Everybody's too stupid!

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - EVENING

               Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom.  
               She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box 
               (black hair dye). She wets her hair, then goes into the 
               bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk 
               rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and 
               flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs, 
               dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.

               She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is 
               an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.

               Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and 
               we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting 
               old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The song continues. Enid sits in her bean-bag chair. Her 
               hair is now dyed back to black. As the song ends, she picks 
               up the needle and starts it again.

               INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, it took a while before I got a 
                         chance to play it, but when I heard 
                         that song it was like --

                                     SEYMOUR
                         So you really liked it? Yeah, there's 
                         some really rare performances. You 
                         liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, that's good too... the whole 
                         record was good, but that one song, 
                         "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly 
                         just keep playing that one over and 
                         over... Do you have any other records 
                         like that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         The Skip James record? Yeah, that's 
                         a masterpiece. There are no other 
                         records like that! I actually have 
                         the original 78 of it in my 
                         collection. It's one of maybe five 
                         known copies.

                                     ENID
                              (nearly sincere)
                         Wow!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Do you want to see it? I can run 
                         upstairs and get it...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, sure, I guess...

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (to Joe, he always 
                              says this when he 
                              leaves his table)
                         Watch my stuff.

               Seymour exits. An uncomfortable pause as Enid stands at the 
               table. She touches the mongoose's tooth.

                                     JOE
                              (not looking up)
                         You still interested in that?

                                     ENID
                         I thought it wasn't for sale.

                                     JOE
                         I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it 
                         go...

                                     ENID
                         It's kind of falling apart.

               Seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious 
               object.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Here it is. It's only about V minus 
                         and has an incipient lam crack, but 
                         plays decent as I recall.

               Seymour passes the 78 to Enid who follows suit and holds it 
               carefully by the edges.

                                     ENID
                         Wow...

               Enid pretends to drop the record.

                                     ENID
                         Oops! I dropped it!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         NO!!!

                                     ENID
                         Hey, I was only kidding!

               She hands the record back to Seymour, who's shaken and 
               embarrassed.

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, Seymour... are you all right?

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               Starts with a PAN ACROSS a wall of unimpressive high school 
               art: dumb drawings of fighting Chuck Norris-types, traced 
               centerfolds, highly sexualized horses, etc. And, on a table, 
               a wire sculpture made from two coathangers.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm not going to start a discourse 
                         on the subject of "good" art vs. 
                         "bad" art; these judgments are for 
                         each person to make on his own. I 
                         merely want to help each of you find 
                         the best way to look within yourselves 
                         the best key to your particular lock. 
                         Last week I asked you to-try and 
                         create a piece of artwork that 
                         responds to something that you have 
                         strong feelings about.

               Enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And it looks like we have some really 
                         interesting work up here....

               Roberta peruses some of the art, then points to a very violent 
               drawing.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What can you tell, us about your 
                         piece... uh...
                              (struggles to read 
                              signature)
                         ...Phillip?

                                     PHILLIP
                              (very stupid and 
                              nervous)
                         Uh... it's uh... it's about The 
                         Mutilator...

                                     ROBERTA
                         My goodness!

                                     PHILLIP
                         It's this really great video game 
                         about a guy who kills people with a 
                         big hammer...

                              (trying to make a 
                              joke)
                         I thought maybe this was supposed to 
                         be your father.

               No response from Phillip. Roberta nicks up Enid's sketchbook 
               and leafs through it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And what can you tell us about this...
                              (searches for name)

                                     ENID
                         Enid. It's sort of like a diary I 
                         guess.

               We see several sketches, including the drawing of the 
               SATANISTS. Roberta shows a few pages to the class.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think that Phillip and Enid can 
                         help us to see that there are-many 
                         different ways we can express 
                         ourselves.  We can do things like 
                         these cartoons that are amusing as a 
                         sort of light entertainment or we 
                         can do work that is more serious in 
                         scope and feeling and that deals 
                         with issues; emotional, spiritual, 
                         political; of great importance. I 
                         hope that you will each have the 
                         tools to do that type of work by the 
                         end of this class.

                              WIRE SCULPTURE)
                         Who is responsible for this?

                                     MARGARET
                         I am.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Talk to us about it...

                                     MARGARET
                         It's my response to the issue of a 
                         woman's right to choose... it's 
                         something I feel super-strongly about.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? 
                         This definitely falls into that higher 
                         category of art I was speaking of 
                         earlier.

               MARGARET glances over at Enid. Enid gives her a dirty look.

               INT. "MASTERPIECE VIDEO" STORE - AFTERNOON.

               On a monitor, a generic trailer is playing.

                                     MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
                         Hello and welcome to Masterpiece 
                         video. How may I help you this 
                         afternoon, sir?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         I'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2.

                                     MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
                         Yessir! Is it a new release, sir?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         No, it's the classic Italian film.

                                     MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
                         Let me look that up on the computer 
                         for you, sir!

                                     (FIDDLES WITH COMPUTER)
                         Yes, here it is - 9 1/2 WEEKS with 
                         Mickey Rourke. It's in our "Erotic 
                         Dramas" section.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         No, not "9 1/2", 8 1/2 , the Fellini 
                         film.

                                     MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
                         I'll check that for you sir. How do 
                         you spell the actor's name - F-I-L-E-
                         E-P-E-E...?

               WE SEE Enid & Rebecca, dressed up in sexy outfits.

                         How about this one?

                                     ENID
                         Hey, you have to see my new good 
                         luck charm.

               She pulls out a small porcelain figure of a MAN FLUSHING 
               HIMSELF DOWN A TOILET with the words "Goodbye Cruel World" 
               on the base.

                                     REBECCA
                         Ew ... when did you get that?

                                     ENID
                         This morning at Seymour's garage 
                         sale.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, aren't you tired of Seymour 
                         yet?

               Rebecca picks up another tape.

                                     REBECCA
                         How about this?

                                     ENID
                         Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All 
                         these movies suck.

               An obnoxious SIX-YEAR-OLD tries to get his PARENTS to add 
               another tape to their already tall stack. He stares at the 
               video monitor.

                         Hello! How are you young ladies this 
                         evening? May I help you find a 
                         particular Masterpiece movie?

                                     ENID
                         No.

               They walk by him.

                                     ENID
                         Let's get out of here, this place 
                         makes me sick.

                                     REBECCA
                         We have to do something fun tonight 
                         this is my last weekend of freedom 
                         before I start my stupid job.

                                     ENID
                         I know a party we could go to...

                                     REBECCA
                         What? Where?!

                                     ENID
                         It's a surprise.

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't believe you.

                                     ENID
                         If I promise you there's really a 
                         party with a lot of guys, do you 
                         promise you'll go?

               INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

               A depressing COLLECTORS' GET-TOGETHER in progress. Enid & 
               Rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner. Nine or ten RECORD 
               COLLECTORS mill about.

                                     JEROME
                         There are some records I will pay 
                         serious money for, provided they're 
                         a sincere V plus. Other than that 
                         I'd prefer to just have them on CD.

                                     STEVEN
                         CDs will never have the presence of 
                         an original 78.

                                     JEROME
                         WRR-ONG! A digital transfer adequately 
                         mastered will sound identical to the 
                         original. Do you have a decent 
                         equalizer?

                                     STEVEN
                         I have a Klipsch 2B3.

                                     JEROME
                         Obviously the problem! You expect a 
                         ten-band equalizer to impart state 
                         of-the-art sound? Dream a little 
                         dream! etc...

               Enid & Rebecca are sitting nearby.

                                     REBECCA
                         I totally, totally hate you.

                                     ENID
                         Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.

               ANGLE ON: Joe stands talking to GERROLD, an obnoxious, pushy, 
               fast-talking guy who keeps eyeing Rebecca. He shovels food 
               into his mouth as he speaks.

                                     GERROLD
                         So what's the story with the two 
                         cheerleaders over here?

                                     JOE
                         They're Seymour's.

                                     GERROLD
                         Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!

                                     JOE
                         Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' 
                         any and neither are you.

                                     GERROLD
                              (poking Joe in the 
                              chest)
                         Let me tell ya somethin', Joe...  
                         Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a 
                         home run without swinging the bat!

                                     JOE
                         Right.

               Gerrold walks over to where Rebecca is sitting. He sits on 
               the arm of sofa next to her.

                                     GERROLD
                         Mind if I sit here?

                                     REBECCA
                              (staring straight 
                              ahead)
                         Yes.

                                     GERROLD
                         Whoa, that was cold! Hey, you're 
                         okay, you're pretty sharp. So uh... 
                         hey, you're wearing a green dress - 
                         whadda you Irish? I bet you're Irish. 
                         What's your name?

                                     REBECCA
                         Melorra...

                                     GERROLD
                         Melorra, listen to me - let me tell 
                         you something Melorra... you seem 
                         like an interesting chick - what are 
                         you doing hanging out with these 
                         losers here? Whaddya say you and me 
                         take off and hit some nightspots 
                         etc. etc.

                                     ENID
                         I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get 
                         a beer.

                                     REBECCA
                              (to ENID)
                         Wait...

               Enid goes over to the beer keg. Nearby Seymour stands talking 
               to PAUL - a humorless, middle-aged guy in a suit and tie 
               who's contemptuously examining one of Seymour's 78s.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...but it plays like new. There's no 
                         groove wear.

                                     PAUL
                         Oh please... It has an enlarged center 
                         hole and a hair crack.

               Enid approaches them.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         But the crack is so tight it's 
                         completely inaudible.

                                     PAUL
                         A tight hair crack is just that - a 
                         crack. I don't collect cracked 
                         records.
                              (walking away)
                         I only pay a premium for mint records 
                         Seymour, you know that!  Please!

                                     ENID
                         What was all that stuff about enlarged 
                         holes and tight cracks?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I didn't think you would have 
                         any interest in this get together... 
                         I mean if you had told me you were 
                         coming I would have warned you -- 
                         it's not like a real party or 
                         anything.

                                     ENID
                         You're right about that.
                              (pause)
                         So this is your record collection?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh God no. This is just junk I have 
                         for sale or trade. The record room 
                         is off-limits.

                                     ENID
                         Really? Can I see it?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well sure... you can if you 
                         want to... it's just I don't want 
                         all these guys in there at once... 
                         you know...

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               Enid & Seymour enter his inner sanctum, beverage containers 
               in hand -- nicely-displayed old collectibles cover just about 
               every inch of wall space.

                                     ENID
                         Wow! This is like my dream room!  
                         Are these all records!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I have about fifteen hundred 78s at 
                         this point. I've tried to pare down 
                         my collection to the essential...

                                     ENID
                         God, look at this poster!  I can't 
                         believe this room! You're the luckiest 
                         guy in the world! I'd kill to have 
                         stuff like this!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Please... go ahead and kill me!  
                         This stuff doesn't make you happy, 
                         believe me.

                                     ENID
                         Oh, come on! What are you talking 
                         about?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You think it's healthy to obsessively 
                         collect things? You can't connect 
                         with other people so you fill your 
                         life with stuff...  I'm just like 
                         all the rest of these pathetic 
                         collector losers.

               Enid writes her name in the dust.

                                     ENID
                         No you're not! You're a cool guy, 
                         Seymour.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why 
                         haven't I had a girlfriend in four 
                         years? I can't even remember the 
                         last time a girl talked to me.

                                     ENID
                         I'm talking to you... I'll bet there 
                         are tons of women who would go out 
                         with you in a minute!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh, right...

                                     ENID
                         No really... I guarantee I could get 
                         you a date in like two seconds...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Good luck...

                                     ENID
                         I'm totally serious!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well...

                                     ENID
                         I mean it -- You leave everything to 
                         me -- I'm going to be your own 
                         personal dating service!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I appreciate the offer but you really 
                         don't --

                                     ENID
                         Mark my words, by the end of this 
                         summer you'll be up to your neck in 
                         pussy!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid 
                         but I - I really --

               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

               As Enid and Seymour walk. A 20-ish secretary-type passes.

                                     ENID
                         What about her? Would you go out 
                         with her?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't know, what kind of question 
                         is that? I mean it's totally 
                         irrelevant because a girl like that 
                         would never be caught dead with me...

                                     ENID
                         But putting that aside for now, would 
                         you go out with her?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I really didn't get a good look at 
                         her.

               A breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by.

                                     ENID
                         Okay, what about this one? Are you 
                         into girls with big tits?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (embarrassed)
                         Jesus!

                                     ENID
                         C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect 
                         data here! Don't you want me to find 
                         you your perfect dream girl?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm just not one of those guys who 
                         has a "type"...

                                     ENID
                         Every guy has a type!

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (he doesn't really 
                              mean this)
                         I mean as long as she's not a complete 
                         imbecile and she's even remotely 
                         attractive...

               They walk by "the pants."

                                     ENID
                         Hey look, there's Norman!

               He's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop.

                                     ENID
                         Hi Norman.

               Norman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid.

               EXT. CITY STREET/NEAR SIDEWINDER - DAY

               They're in another part of town near THE SIDEWINDER.

                                     ENID
                         We need to narrow this down somehow... 
                         we need to find a place where you 
                         can meet women who share your 
                         interests.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Maybe I don't want to meet someone 
                         who shares my interests.  I hate my 
                         interests! Where can I go to meet 
                         the exact opposite of myself?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your 
                         five main interests, in order of 
                         importance.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (sighs)
                         Well, let's see... I guess I'd have 
                         to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and 
                         Ragtime music at the top of the list, 
                         then probably...

                                     ENID
                         Let's just say "music" - that way 
                         you only use up one...
                              (spots The Sidewinder)
                         Wait, we have to go in here for a 
                         second...

               INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

               They enter. Josh has his back to the counter as he makes a 
               complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl.

                                     ENID
                         Hi Josh.

                                     JOSH
                              (without turning around)
                         Hi.

                                     ENID
                         I just stopped in to say hi.

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, well... hi...

               He turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae. He looks 
               up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour).

                                     ENID
                         This is my friend Seymour.

               Josh is startled and drops the sundae. The girl starts crying. 
               Josh immediately starts to clean up the mess. Enid, satisfied, 
               heads with Seymour for the door.

                                     ENID
                         See you later, Josh!

               As the door closes, we hear a familiar voice.

                                     BOSS
                         JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?

               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

               Enid & Seymour continue walking.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (pause)
                         So is that your boyfriend?

                                     ENID
                         Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend...  
                         He's just this guy that Becky and I 
                         like to torture.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well are --

                                     ENID
                              (interrupts suddenly)
                         Oh my god! We have to go in here!

               They are in front of STAN'S, a porno shop.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, sure... very funny....

                                     ENID
                         Please, Seymour... Becky and I have 
                         been dying to go in here but we can't 
                         get any boys to take us...  Please?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I - I'd really rather not...

                                     ENID
                         We'll just go in for one minute -- 
                         it'll be a riot!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't think so...

                                     ENID
                         PLEASE? We have to!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I really don't think it's a good 
                         idea.

                                     ENID
                         Fine, I'll go by myself then...

               INT. ANTHONY'S II - DAY

               Enid & Seymour enter. There are a half dozen MEN browsing 
               through the videos and magazines.

                                     ENID
                              (whispering)
                         Wow! Look at all these creeps!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Shh!

                                     ENID
                         OH MY GOD!

               Enid runs over and grabs a BLOW-UP SEX DOLL. Everyone in the 
               store looks at them. Seymour blushes and sweats.

                                     ENID
                         What kind of weirdo would actually 
                         have sex with this? We have to buy 
                         this!

               She looks around, over-stimulated.

                                     ENID
                         God, this place is a total riot!

               She picks up a magazine.

                                     ENID
                         Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - 
                         isn't child pornography totally 
                         illegal?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         These are older women just dressed 
                         up to look young... I think.

               ANGLE ON a pair of THIGH-HIGH LEATHER FETISH BOOTS.

                                     ENID (V.O.)
                         Oh my god!

               WIDER ANGLE: She's in another part of the store near the 
               CASHIER.

                                     ENID
                         How much are these boots? Do you 
                         have these in size five?

                                     CASHIER
                         That's the only pair of those I have 
                         right now. I'm getting a new order 
                         in next week...

               She spots something and gasps. She yells across the store.

                                     ENID
                         OH MY GOD SEYMOUR! You have to lend 
                         me the money to buy this.

               Everyone looks at Seymour as he sheepishly approaches. He 
               takes out his wallet.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, I don't have much money with me 
                         right now.

                                     ENID
                         C'mon, Seymour, please?

                                     CASHIER
                         Why don't you come back in two weeks - 
                         we'll be having our annual Back-to-
                         School sale.

               INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Rebecca is at the counter serving a long line of YUPPIES. We 
               can see a sign next to the counter that reads: "Answer today's 
               trivia question and get a free small coffee".

                                     YUPPIE #1
                         I'd like a medium latte for here.

                                     REBECCA
                         Can I get you a biscotti to go with 
                         that?

                                     YUPPIE #1
                         NO! Just the latte.

               Enid is next wearing a RUBBER BONDAGE MASK with devil horns.

                                     ENID (V.O.)
                         Give me all your money, bitch!

                                     REBECCA
                         Where did you get that?

                                     ENID
                         You won't believe it! Guess!

                                     REBECCA
                         Where?

                                     ENID
                         Anthony's II!

                                     REBECCA
                         No way... when?

                                     ENID
                         Just now... I went with Seymour.

                                     REBECCA
                         You cunt!

               FELDMAN is in line behind Enid. He's a poodle-haired, fedora 
               wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair-golf cart 
               contraption.

                                     FELDMAN
                         Excuse me - I can't read the trivia 
                         question!

               Enid is in the way. She reads it to him.

                                     ENID
                         "Where on the human body is the 
                         'Douglas Pouch' located?"

               Feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while 
               Rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee. A DIGITAL 
               GRAPHIC of the FEMALE FORM on his computer screen. With a 
               few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the 
               REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. An area behind the cervix BLINKS.

                                     FELDMAN
                         Slightly below the uterus on a female.

               He takes his coffee and putters towards the door.

                                     ENID
                         That guy is totally amazing.

                                     REBECCA
                         He does that every single day.

                                     YUPPIE #2
                         Can I get a decaf mocha to go?

                                     REBECCA
                         Can I get you a...

                                     YUPPIE #2
                         NO, I don't want a biscotti with 
                         that.

               YUPPIE #2 pays and leaves.

                                     ENID
                         God, how can you stand all these 
                         assholes?

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know... Some people are okay, 
                         but mostly I feel like poisoning 
                         everybody.

                                     ENID
                         At least the wheelchair guy is sort 
                         of entertaining...

                                     REBECCA
                         He's a total asshole... He doesn't 
                         even need that wheelchair, he's just 
                         totally lazy!

                                     ENID
                         That rules!

                                     REBECCA
                         No, it doesn't. You'll see... you 
                         get totally sick of all the creeps 
                         and losers and weirdos.

                                     ENID
                         But those are our people...

                                     REBECCA
                         Yeah, well...
                              (pause)
                         So when are you going to get your 
                         job?

                                     ENID
                         I'm working on it... I've got a few 
                         leads... it's just that right now I 
                         have, all these projects that take 
                         up all my time.

                                     REBECCA
                         Like what?

                                     ENID
                         Nothing. Don't worry... I promise 
                         I'll get a job next week.

                                     REBECCA
                              (pause)
                         God, I can't believe you went to 
                         Anthony's without me.

               INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Enid and her dad are eating breakfast. A 13" TV sits on the 
               kitchen counter behind them.

                         Hope comes in all forms. To the 
                         endangered white stork searching for 
                         wetlands it comes in the form of a 
                         sanctuary provided by people who 
                         care. Do people care? Chevron does. 
                         That's why at Chevron we're just as 
                         concerned...

                                     DAD
                         Are you still looking for a job? Do 
                         you have any leads?

                                     ENID
                         Will you get off my back for once?

                                     DAD
                         It's tough to find a good job without 
                         any kind of training.

                                     ENID
                         Look, I told you I'm not going to 
                         college.

                                     DAD
                         Well, I think it's good to keep all 
                         your options open. You can always 
                         enroll for the winter quarter.  You 
                         could even live here and go to the 
                         city college part time, and still 
                         get a job if you wanted to.

                                     ENID
                         Look at me -- I'm not even listening 
                         to a word you're saying.

               Pause.

                                     DAD
                         Did I tell you who I ran into at the 
                         bagel place?

                                     ENID
                              (reading cereal box)
                         Who?

                                     DAD
                         Guess.

                                     ENID
                         How should I know?

                                     DAD
                         Someone from the past.

                         Who?

                                     DAD
                         Give up?

                                     ENID
                         YES.

                         Maxine.

                         Not the Maxine?

                                     DAD
                         Yup.

                         God, how horrifying.

               INT. COLLEGE COFFEE HOUSE DAY

               Enid and Rebecca sit in a semi-crowded college hang-out.

                                     REBECCA
                         ...you don't have to make a million 
                         dollars -- just get any stupid job 
                         so we can at least start looking for 
                         an apartment.

                                     ENID
                              (thoughtful pause)
                         I wonder if I hang around with you 
                         because you're like my surrogate 
                         mother figure or something. Like I 
                         have this subconscious biological 
                         need to be nagged and bitched at 
                         constantly.

                                     REBECCA
                         You hang out with me because nobody 
                         else can stand to be around you.

                                     ENID
                         Or maybe... did you ever think that 
                         deep down we really might be lesbos? 
                         Maybe that's why we spend so much 
                         time together.

                                     REBECCA
                         You're gross.
                              (pause)
                         See that guy?

                                     ENID
                         Which one?

                                     REBECCA
                         He gives me a total boner!

                         He's like the biggest idiot of all 
                         time!

               The guy, a COLLEGE SOPHOMORE, walks by them with two friends.

                         tonight?

                         Okay, you're right.

                                     ENID
                              (whispers)
                         Heads up.

               An earnest "ALTERNATIVE-ROCK" GUY approaches Rebecca. He 
               hands her a flyer.

                                     GUY
                         Hey, my band is playing here on Friday 
                         night and uh... there's gonna be a 
                         bunch of cool bands playing and stuff 
                         and you don't have to pay if you 
                         show this flyer at the door... you 
                         should come check it out.

                                     REBECCA
                              (shyly)
                         Thanks...
                              (she looks away)

               Enid takes the flyer from Rebecca.  There are a bunch of 
               bands listed.

                                     ENID
                         Which one is your band?

                                     GUY
                         Alien Autopsy.

                                     ENID
                              (sarcastic)
                         Bitchin'.

                                     GUY
                              (embarrassing pause; 
                              then, to Rebecca)
                         Yeah, well... maybe I'll see you 
                         there...
                              (pause; walks away)

                                     ENID
                         What a dork!

                                     REBECCA
                         You're just jealous.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, right... Believe me, at this 
                         point I'm over the fact that every 
                         single guy likes you better than me!

                                     REBECCA
                         Face it, you hate every single boy 
                         on the face of the earth!

                                     ENID
                         That's not true, I just hate all 
                         these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo-
                         bohemian losers!
                              (sad pause)
                         Sometimes I think I act so weird 
                         because I'm crazy from sexual 
                         frustration.

                                     REBECCA
                         Haven't you heard about the miracle 
                         of masturbation?

                                     ENID
                              (sighs)
                         ...maybe we should be lesbos...

                                     REBECCA
                         Get away from me!

               INT. ENID'S FANTASY - EVENING

               Starts on full moon in night sky, framed right --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ...a dark moonlit room. Enid lies on her stomach in bed. We 
               MOVE IN CLOSER to her head as though entering her thoughts, 
               which slowly fade in: WE MOVE TOWARD a vertical sliver of 
               light -- a cracked-open bathroom door.

               WE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower. Josh 
               enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of 
               flowers. CUT. We start again, exactly as before, only without 
               the flowers. He starts to take off his clothes. CUT. He enters 
               again and gets right in the shower, fully clothed.

               They begin to kiss. After a passionate moment, the door opens. 
               Rebecca stands there, stunned.

               CUT BACK TO:

               We see only the slightest trace of Enid in the darkness. She 
               sighs.

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               CLOSE-UP ON a charcoal portrait of DON KNOTTS.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Who is this, Enid?

                                     ENID
                         It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

                                     ROBERTA
                         And what was your reason for choosing 
                         him as your subject?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I see... interesting...

               She moves on.

                                     ROBERTA
                         What do we have here, Margaret?

                                     MARGARET
                         It's a tampon in a teacup...

               Class GIGGLES.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I can see that... now what can you 
                         tell us about it? First of all, what 
                         kind of sculpture is this?

                                     MARGARET
                         It's a "found object"... that's when 
                         an artist takes an ordinary object 
                         and places it in an artistic context 
                         and thus it becomes art.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Very good. Now, what can you tell us 
                         about it in regard to your artistic 
                         intent?

                                     MARGARET
                         I guess I see the teacup as a symbol 
                         for womanhood, because of tea parties 
                         in the olden days, but instead of 
                         tea I was trying to kind of confront 
                         people with this... like...

                                     ROBERTA
                         This shocking image of repressed 
                         femininity!

                                     MARGARET
                         Right, exactly!

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think it's really a wonderful piece, 
                         Margaret!

               Enid gives Margaret another dirty look.

                                     ROBERTA
                         This illustrates perfectly what I 
                         was saying about not being afraid to 
                         use controversial imagery, class...

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - DUSK

               Seymour drives. Enid plays with the radio stopping on an 
               obnoxious AM Disc Jockey.

                                     DISC JOCKEY
                         KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful 
                         evening.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         God, that asshole's voice is so 
                         hateful! No wonder I never listen to 
                         the radio!

                                     ENID
                              (shutting it off)
                         Relax, Seymour, relax...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         That thing is just so shrill and 
                         piercing and loud - it's like someone 
                         jabbing me in the face!
                              (imitating insincere 
                              DJ voice)
                         KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful 
                         evening...

               She changes the subject and holds up a 78 record.

                                     ENID
                         So, why did you bring this along?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I brought it for him to autograph.  
                         He's going to be amazed to see it - 
                         it's one of two known copies... I 
                         can't believe they have him for the 
                         opening act and not the headliner.  
                         What an insult!

                                     ENID
                         This bar's going to be packed with 
                         girls for you to pick from.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm not holding my breath in that 
                         department.

               Seymour waits at a stop sign for two OBLIVIOUS OVERWEIGHT 
               WOMEN, each with TODDLERS and baby carriages, to cross..

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What are we, in slow motion here?!  
                         What are ya, hypnotized? Have some 
                         more kids, why don't you?... For 
                         Christ's sake, would you move!?

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, Seymour.

               EXT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

               A marquee reads, "TONITE: BLUESHAMMER also FRED CHATMAN"

               INT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

               FRED CHATMAN, age 82, plays an acoustic blues number. He's 
               good, but he's being politely ignored for the most part by 
               the TWENTY-SOMETHING PATRONS. Most of them are more interested 
               in a baseball game showing on a big-screen TV.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I can't believe these people! They 
                         could at least turn off their stupid 
                         sports game until he's done playing!

               FRED finishes to POLITE APPLAUSE. An M.C. takes the mic.

                                     M.C.
                         Let's hear it for Fred Chatman.
                              (a little more APPLAUSE)
                         Hey don't go away because we've got 
                         Blueshammer coming up in just a 
                         minute!

               A CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her 
               drink. Enid nods in her direction for Seymour's benefit as 
               if to say, "check it out."

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yes, that would certainly do...

                                     ENID
                         Well, offer her a seat! You want me 
                         to do it?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I 
                         gotta think of something to talk to 
                         her about. No! No...

                                     ENID
                         Just wait here.

               Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE 
               GIRL who looks back at Seymour and smiles. She goes to join 
               him. Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving 
               Seymour a "thumbs up."

                                     CUTE GIRL
                         Hi.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Hello. Uh... that was great music, 
                         huh?

                                     CUTE GIRL
                              (sitting down)
                         Yeah, I just love blues.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Actually, technically what he was 
                         mostly playing would more accurately 
                         be classified in the "ragtime" idiom. 
                         Although of course not in the 
                         strictest sense of the more classical 
                         ragtime piano music like that of 
                         Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic 
                         Blues has a more conventional twelve-
                         bar structure in its stanzas.

                                     CUTE GIRL
                         Oh if you like authentic blues, you've 
                         just gotta see Blueshammer!  They're 
                         so great!

               ANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour and 
               Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other people 
               in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop 
               on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He 
               makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue 
               twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on.

               She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off 
               her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse 
               and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted 
               by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty 
               boys.

                              (LEAD SINGER)
                         All right people! Are you ready to 
                         BOOGIE? Cuz we gwine play you some 
                         authentic, way-down-in-the-delta 
                         blues to rock your world! One, Two, 
                         Three...

               A din of loud noise. CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her feet, 
               boogeying to the music.

               Several horny ALPHA MALES press in on Seymour (who's still 
               sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her.

               Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward 
               the bar where Enid sits.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What did you tell that girl?

                                     ENID
                         I told her you were a big record 
                         executive and you were thinking of 
                         signing that band to your label.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Jesus...

               INT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - NIGHT

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Now I remember why I haven't gone 
                         anywhere in months. I'm not even in 
                         the same universe as those creatures 
                         back there. I might as well be from 
                         another planet.

                                     ENID
                         We just need to figure out a place 
                         where you can meet somebody who isn't 
                         a total idiot, that's all.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Look, I really appreciate your help, 
                         Enid, but let's face it, this is 
                         hopeless.

                                     ENID
                         It's not hopeless...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well it's simple for everybody 
                         else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair 
                         of Nikes and they're happy! I just 
                         can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity 
                         either, but I don't think it's totally 
                         hopeless...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         But it's not totally hopeless for 
                         you... I've had it. I don't even 
                         have the energy to try anymore.  You 
                         should make sure you do the exact 
                         opposite of everything I do so you 
                         don't end up like me...

                                     ENID
                         I'd rather end up like you than those 
                         people at that stupid bar...  At 
                         least you're an interesting person... 
                         at least you're not exactly like 
                         everybody else...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Hooray for me.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S APT. - NIGHT

               Enid walks in behind Seymour.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm not sure I have anything to 
                         drink... there might be some --

                                     ENID
                         It doesn't matter, I'm not staying 
                         long... I just want to make sure I 
                         convince you not to give up yet.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         "Yet."

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               They both have drinks now. He puts on a jazz record, an 
               instrumental.

                                     ENID
                              (picks up an antique 
                              knick knack)
                         Wow, this is so cool...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         If you don't mind my asking -- why 
                         do you care so much if I get a date 
                         or not?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... because I can't stand the 
                         idea of a world where a guy like you 
                         can't get a date...

               Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the 
               wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype 
               of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.

                                     ENID
                         What the fuck, Seymour?! What is 
                         this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What?... Oh that... I borrowed that 
                         from work about fifteen years ago... 
                         I guess it's mine now.

                                     ENID
                         What, are you a klansman or something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks 
                         a lot!... Do you know the Cook's 
                         Chicken franchise?

                                     ENID
                              (quoting TV commercial 
                              in deep voice)
                         "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried 
                         with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made 
                         up name. When they originally opened 
                         back in 1922 they were named "The 
                         Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early 
                         painting of their first logo.

               He takes out a scrapbook.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm obsessed with all this stuff - 
                         this lost culture of the 20th century.

               She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken 
               logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then 
               into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's 
               Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, 
               followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's 
               version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels 
               tracing the design evolution of a different company.

                                     ENID
                         Why doesn't everybody know this?

               The record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (somewhat bitterly)
                         It's ancient history. The same reason 
                         nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco 
                         record.

               He puts on another record.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Actually, I was a whole lot more 
                         interested in the Cook's phenomenon 
                         when I was about your age. I've kind 
                         of lost interest since I've been 
                         working for them...

                                     ENID
                         You work at Cook's Chicken?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         For nineteen years...

                                     ENID
                         What are you, a fry cook or something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Nothing so glamorous... actually, 
                         I'm an assistant manager at their 
                         corporate headquarters.

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work 
                         in an office all day.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Hey, I get good benefits, a good 
                         early retirement plan, nobody ever 
                         bothers me...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but still...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I make enough money to eat and buy 
                         old records... what more do I want?

               Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting.

                                     ENID
                         So, I don't really get it -- are you 
                         saying that things were better back 
                         then
                              (points at painting)
                         even though there was stuff like 
                         this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, in a lot of ways things are better 
                         now... I dunno... it's complicated. 
                         Everybody still hates each other, 
                         but they know how to hide it better, 
                         or something...

                                     ENID
                              (suddenly)
                         Hey, can I borrow this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What? Why?

                                     ENID
                         I promise I'll take good care of it.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I dunno... they're very sensitive at 
                         work about all this stuff. Maybe it 
                         would be better if you --

                                     ENID
                         Don't you trust me, Seymour?

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               We see another wall of student art dominated this time by 
               Enid's (Seymour's) 3' x 4' painting.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Let's address some discussion to 
                         this piece.

                                     SNOTTY GIRL
                         I don't like it.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Can you tell us why?

                                     SNOTTY GIRL
                         I don't know.

                                     HIPPY-ISH BOY
                         I think it's totally weak.

                                     BLACK GIRL
                         Yeah, it's not right.

               More kids respond at once. Even Margaret is confused.

                                     ROBERTA
                         These are all valid comments, but I 
                         think we should see if the artist 
                         has anything to bring to this.

                                     ENID
                         Well, I got the idea when I was doing 
                         some research and I discovered that 
                         Cook's Chicken used to be called 
                         Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to 
                         do my project based on this discovery 
                         as kind of a comment on racism... 
                         and the way racism is whitewashed 
                         over in our culture...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Did you actually do this painting?

                                     ENID
                         Well, no - it's more like a "found 
                         art object."

                                     ROBERTA
                         And how do you think this addresses 
                         the subject of racism?

                                     ENID
                         It's complicated... I guess I'm trying 
                         to show how racism used to -- more 
                         out in the open and now it's hidden, 
                         or something...

                                     ROBERTA
                         And how does an image like this help 
                         us to see that?

                                     ENID
                         I'm not sure... I mean...
                              (thinks)
                         I guess because when we see something 
                         like this it seems really shocking 
                         and we have to figure out why it's 
                         so shocking?

               A long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the painting.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I don't really know what to say, 
                         Enid...
                              (another over-long 
                              pause)
                         ...It's a remarkable achievement.

               INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING

               Enid is lying on her back with her head on Rebecca's stomach.

               Both stare blankly at the ceiling.

                                     REBECCA
                         Are you kidding? It's a dream job!  
                         I can't believe you got a job like 
                         that without even trying... God, I 
                         wish that was my job...

                                     ENID
                              (trying to generate 
                              some enthusiasm)
                         Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least 
                         I'll get to see every movie for free, 
                         I guess... I had to lie and tell 
                         them I already graduated...

                                     REBECCA
                         When are you finally going to get 
                         your diploma?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno, but next week is my last 
                         class...

                                     REBECCA
                         Anyway, now we can start looking for 
                         the apartment...
                              (waits for some 
                              response from Enid, 
                              but there is none)
                         Do you remember when we first came 
                         up with that whole idea of renting 
                         our own apartment?

                                     ENID
                         Wasn't it like eighth grade?

                                     REBECCA
                         Seventh... you wanted to move out 
                         right then!

                                     ENID
                         That must have been when my dad was 
                         married to Maxine...

                                     REBECCA
                         I remember our big plan was as soon 
                         as we got the apartment we were going 
                         to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming 
                         over and then fuck him.

                                     ENID
                         We were such desperate sluts back 
                         then.

               INT. PACIFIC THEATER - AFTERNOON

               Enid is behind the candy counter dressed in a brown and orange 
               uniform.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm gonna let you handle the four 
                         thirty crowd by yourself - that way 
                         I can evaluate your performance while 
                         it's slow and ease you into the bigger 
                         crowds.

                                     ENID
                         You can count on me, sir!

               A customer, an ALCOHOLIC LOSER, approaches the candy counter.

                                     LOSER
                         Do you serve beer or any alcohol?

                                     ENID
                         I wish!... actually you wish... after 
                         about five minutes of this movie 
                         you'll wish to God you had about ten 
                         beers!

               LOSER stares blankly, hesitates, then goes into theater.

                                     MANAGER
                              (pulling her aside)
                         What are you doing? You don't ever 
                         criticize the feature!

                                     ENID
                         Why? What difference does it make?  
                         You already got his money...

                                     MANAGER
                         Look, that's the policy... if you 
                         want to make up your own rules you 
                         can open your own theater...

                                     ENID
                         But I was only trying to be 
                         friendly...

                                     MANAGER
                         Look, we don't pay you to be a movie 
                         critic -- just do your job.

                                     ENID
                         Okay, okay... I won't say a word...

               ANOTHER ANGLE - an hour has gone by.

                         Medium popcorn.

                                     ENID
                         That's three dollars.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Let me have plenty of butter on that.

                                     ENID
                         Ewww!...
                              (making a face)
                         Here you go -- smothered in delicious 
                         yellow-chemical sludge!

                                     MANAGER
                              (pulling her aside)
                         What the hell is wrong with you?!

                                     ENID
                         What? I'm just kidding around with 
                         the customers... It's my shtick!

                                     MANAGER
                         Well lose it! And why aren't you 
                         pushing the large sizes? Didn't you 
                         get training about upsizing?

                                     ENID
                         But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.

                                     MANAGER
                         It's not optional!

                                     ENID
                         Jesus...

                                     CUSTOMER #2
                         Can I get a medium sprite?

                                     ENID
                         A medium sprite? Why sir, do you not 
                         know that for a mere twenty five 
                         cents more you could purchase a large 
                         beverage that has a volume of over 
                         twice that of a puny medium drink?
                              (she gives MANAGER a 
                              look)
                         ...I'm only telling you this because 
                         we're such good friends -- Medium is 
                         strictly for suckers who don't 
                         understand the concept of value!

               INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY

               Rebecca is behind the counter glaring at Enid.

                                     REBECCA
                         What are you talking about? What 
                         kind of loser gets fired after one 
                         day?!

                                     ENID
                         I told you - my manager was a total 
                         asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to 
                         get another job... and anyway, I 
                         have some ideas for how to make money 
                         in the meantime...

               An angry CUSTOMER returns with her drink.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         I'm not at all happy with this latte 
                         what do you intend to do about it?

               EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

               It's the next day. Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in front of 
               her apartment building. Rebecca arrives.

                                     REBECCA
                         This is it? I can't believe you're 
                         selling some of this stuff.

                                     ENID
                         Fuck it. Everything must go!

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my god, I remember this hat... 
                         this was during your little old lady 
                         phase...

               A trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through the 
               clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous 
               looking stuffed animal.

                                     HIPSTER
                         How much is this?

                                     ENID
                         That's not for sale.

                                     HIPSTER
                              (noticing price tag)
                         Wait, it says five dollars...

                                     ENID
                         Oh, that's a mistake -- I decided 
                         not to sell it...

               The HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves.

                                     REBECCA
                         What was that all about? I thought 
                         everything must go!

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let 
                         some asshole with a goatee own Goofy 
                         Gus.

               A couple is browsing. The GIRL, a severely skinny, CLUBHOPPER 
               TYPE in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the BOY, a long 
               haired SKATEBOARDER, goes through her records.

                                     GIRL
                         How much is this dress?

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh my god, you're selling that?

                                     ENID
                              (long pause)
                         That's five hundred dollars.

                                     GIRL
                         What?

                                     ENID
                         Five hundred.

                                     GIRL
                         You're crazy -- it should be like 
                         two dollars!

                                     ENID
                         I was wearing that dress the day I 
                         lost my virginity.

                                     GIRL
                         Well why do I care about that?

                                     ENID
                         Why do you even want it? It would 
                         look stupid on you.

                                     GIRL
                         God, fuck you!

               Enid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book.

                                     ENID
                         Put that stuff back, it's not for 
                         sale.

                                     BOY
                         What is this? Some fuckin' joke?

                                     ENID
                         Yes! Go away!

               They stomp off.

                         Now are you going to get a regular 
                         job?

                                     ENID
                              (defeated, quiet)
                         Don't worry.

                                     REBECCA
                         If it makes you feel any better, I 
                         don't think you could've gotten more 
                         than ten bucks for all this stuff.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, thanks.

               EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

               Twenty minutes later. Most of the stuff is gone. Enid packs 
               up one last box to carry inside.

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you want to do something tonight?

                                     ENID
                         I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...
                              (suddenly)
                         Shit! What time is it?  I have to go 
                         to the store! I was going to make 
                         him a cake...

                                     REBECCA
                              (miffed, sighs)
                         Well, are we still going shopping 
                         tomorrow?

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, I guess... call me...

               She heads toward the stairs with the box. Rebecca watches 
               her go.

                                     REBECCA
                         Since when can you make a cake?

               INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - EVENING

               Enid presents Seymour with a HOSTESS CUPCAKE with a single 
               lit candle in the center. The lights are off.

                                     ENID
                         You can open your eyes now.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I 
                         really appreciate it...

                                     ENID
                         No, Doofus... blow it out!

               He leans forward and blows out the candle, then abruptly 
               straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain. Enid 
               turns the lights back on.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...

                                     ENID
                         Are you okay?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just my stupid back. I'll be 
                         all right in a minute...

               She notices him adjust something under his shirt.

                                     ENID
                         What is that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh... uh... It's just this elastic 
                         thing I have to wear for lumbar 
                         support...

                                     ENID
                         What, like a girdle?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Maybe now you understand why I can't 
                         get a date.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, well, you're not the only one.  
                         Everybody I know has totally fucked 
                         up problems... It seems like only 
                         stupid people have good 
                         relationships...

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (sarcastically cheering 
                              her on)
                         That's the spirit!

                                     ENID
                         I mean, I'm eighteen years old and 
                         I've never even had a real, steady 
                         boyfriend for more than like two 
                         weeks!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Really?

                                     ENID
                         Never...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm starting to think that even if I 
                         did get a girlfriend it really 
                         wouldn't change anything.

                                     ENID
                         I know. It's not like it makes all 
                         your problems go away.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Then again, that's easy for me to 
                         say, since I'll never even get a 
                         date. I'm sure you have hundreds of 
                         guys who are interested in you.

                                     ENID
                         Actually, I've got a total crush on 
                         this one guy right now, but it's a 
                         really fucked-up situation...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh yeah?

                                     ENID
                         Oh wait, you met him... remember 
                         that guy Josh? I'm like practically 
                         obsessed with him, but I can't do 
                         anything about it because Becky would 
                         freak out.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Why?

                                     ENID
                         Never mind, it's way too 
                         complicated...
                              (pause)
                         Did you have problems like this when 
                         you were my age - where you're totally 
                         confused all the time?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I won't even dignify that with a 
                         response.

               He gets up and looks through his shelves for a record.

                                     ENID
                              (looking at his records)
                         I wonder if you really like all these 
                         old records or if you only like the 
                         fact that nobody else likes them?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (a sore subject)
                         Who knows?

               The phone RINGS. Seymour ignores it.

                                     ENID
                         Aren't you going to get that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Let the machine get it. I have no 
                         desire to talk to anyone who would 
                         be calling me...

               After several more RINGS the machine picks up and we hear 
               Seymour's message. After the BEEP there's a long fumbling 
               pause...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I knew it... it's my mother.

                                     VOICE ON MACHINE
                         Uh... HI!  Uh... I'm calling for... 
                         um... you placed an ad in the Weekly 
                         over a month ago and... well, I'm 
                         the redhead in the yellow dress... 
                         at least I think I am... I saw the 
                         ad when you first placed it but I 
                         was in this relationship at the time 
                         so I cut it out, and now I'm not in 
                         the relationship anymore...
                              (giggles)
                         God, this is really confusing... 
                         anyway, if you still want to talk to 
                         me I can be reached at KL5-2603, 
                         that's my work number and my name is 
                         Dana... um... BYE!

                                     ENID
                         Wow!
                              (feigning ignorance)
                         What was that all about?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just somebody's idea of a joke...

                                     ENID
                         That didn't sound like a joke to 
                         me... what, did you write a personal 
                         ad or something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (still confused)
                         Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called 
                         before once... it's just somebody 
                         trying to humiliate me.

                                     ENID
                         Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a 
                         joke -- you have to call her back!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         How can you be so sure?

                                     ENID
                         Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff 
                         like this -- she was totally for 
                         real!

               INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - ABOUT 10 PM

               Enid enters - a light is on in the kitchen.

                                     DAD (O.S.)
                         Pumpkin? Could you come in here for 
                         a minute?

               She walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment. She 
               sees, first, her Dad (wearing an apron) and then, a hauntingly 
               familiar MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.

                                     DAD
                         Pumpkin, do you remember Maxine?

                                     MAXINE
                         Hi, Enid.

                                     ENID
                         Hi.
                              (to Dad)
                         Look, I'm kind of tired - I think 
                         I'll go to bed.

                                     DAD
                         I made spaghetti. Do you want some?

                                     ENID
                         I-I really have to get up early for 
                         class tomorrow.

                                     MAXINE
                         It's really quite something to see 
                         you all grown up like this, Enid.
                              (no response from 
                              Enid)
                         I'd love to hear about what you're 
                         doing. I can't help but feel that I 
                         had some small part in how you turned 
                         out...
                              (another silent pause)
                         What are you studying? You were always 
                         such a smart little girl.

                                     ENID
                         I'm taking a remedial high school 
                         art class for fuck-ups and retards.

               INT. ART CLASS - DAY

               A toothy, zit-covered 14-YEAR-OLD BOY poses with a very poorly-
               made sculpture. A flash goes off and he jumps slightly, 
               sending pieces of his sculpture flying.

               It's Roberta, taking photos. She moves on to Enid, in front 
               of her big painting.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Smile, Enid...

               Enid ad-libs a weird expression as... the flash goes off.

               Roberta now turns to address the class.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm going to miss you people... I 
                         feel that we've all done a lot of 
                         growing this summer. I hope that 
                         each of you feels as though you'll 
                         be taking away something from this 
                         experience; I know I certainly will 
                         be...

               A long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Remember, the art show is this 
                         Saturday at seven-thirty sharp. Try 
                         to get there at least 15 minutes 
                         early.

               The students get their things together and file out.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?

                                     ENID
                         Uh-oh.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I 
                         was just wondering what your plans 
                         were for next year?

                                     ENID
                         I'm not really sure - working, I 
                         guess...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, I know this is really short 
                         notice, but I got a call from a very 
                         close friend at the Academy of Art & 
                         Design and she tells me that I'm 
                         allowed to place one student from 
                         your graduating class in a one year 
                         scholarship program... and, well, I 
                         hope you don't mind, Enid, but I 
                         took the liberty of submitting your 
                         name.

               She gives her a booklet and an application form.

                                     ENID
                         Hmm.

                                     ROBERTA
                         As far as I know it includes housing 
                         and meals and everything... it is 
                         really quite an offer...

                                     ENID
                         ...wow...

                                     ROBERTA
                              (pause)
                         So what do you think?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... Would I have to take 
                         classes and stuff?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well, yes...

                                     ENID
                         I...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. 
                         This could be a great thing for you.

               INT. INDOOR SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca are in a Crate & Barrel-type store looking at 
               housewares.

                                     ENID
                         I think one of us should fuck Josh...

                                     REBECCA
                         Go ahead...

                                     ENID
                         No, really...

                                     REBECCA
                         God, you're really obsessed...

                                     ENID
                         I am not -- I just think it'd be 
                         funny to see what he'd do...

                                     REBECCA
                         I thought we decided that Josh was 
                         way too cool to be interested in 
                         sex, and that he's the only decent 
                         person left in the world and we would 
                         never want to bring him down to our 
                         level and all that...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but maybe one of us should at 
                         least try...

                                     REBECCA
                         No matter what happened it would be 
                         a big disaster... Let's just try and 
                         keep everything the way it is.

               Rebecca spots some particularly fetching dishware.

                                     REBECCA
                         Look, we have to get these...

                                     ENID
                         I can't afford stuff like this right 
                         now.

                                     REBECCA
                         I'm sick of waiting - we need to 
                         start getting stuff if we're ever 
                         going to move.
                              (pause, sees towels)
                         Aren't these the greatest towels?

                                     ENID
                         Why do you care about this kind of 
                         stuff?

                                     REBECCA
                         Don't you want nice stuff?

                                     ENID
                         I can't imagine spending money on 
                         towels.

                                     REBECCA
                         You don't have to. I'll pay for all 
                         the stuff right now and you can pay 
                         me back when you finally get a job.

                                     ENID
                         You're insane.

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you still want to go to that thing 
                         tonight?

                                     ENID
                         What thing?

                                     REBECCA
                         That guy's band is playing tonight... 
                         Alien Autopsy.

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going 
                         on his big date tonight and I kind 
                         of want to be around when he calls, 
                         so I can hear how bad it went.

                                     REBECCA
                         God, I'm so sick of Seymour.

               INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               Seymour is just finishing the dinner DANA has cooked for 
               them at her place. Dana is an attractive redhead, about 40.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         That was great - jeez, thanks again 
                         for cooking all this.

                                     DANA
                         Oh I love to cook. I guess most women 
                         wouldn't invite a man over on the 
                         first date, but I believe you should 
                         trust your instincts. When I talked 
                         to you on the phone you just seemed 
                         so... I don't know... harmless. Ready 
                         for ice cream?

               Dana heads for the kitchen. Seymour gets up to relieve his 
               backache. He walks over to a framed photo on the wall.

                                     DANA
                         Here we are... it's mocha mint from 
                         Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that 
                         photograph just heart-rending?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?

                                     DANA
                         Was it Bosnia? I forget...
                              (pause)
                         It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire 
                         country eloquently captured in the 
                         face of one little boy.
                              (pause)
                         A Soul/Funk song starts up on the 
                         radio that catches her attention. 
                         She goes over and turns it up.

                                     DANA
                         Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it 
                         great? Doesn't it make you want to 
                         dance? C'mon!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, 
                         heh, heh...

                                     DANA
                         Don't be silly, anyone can dance.  
                         Here, just follow me... watch my 
                         feet.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, really I --

               She drags him around. He's still holding his ice cream.

                                     DANA
                         C'mon Seymour, it's all in your mind. 
                         Just loosen up and feel the music! 
                         Here, put down your bowl of ice cream.

               She takes his ice cream and puts it on a table.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (checking his watch)
                         Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're 
                         gonna have to leave now if we're 
                         going to make that movie.

                                     DANA
                         Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just 
                         let me put a few things away.

               She shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream.

                                     DANA
                         I'm so excited to see this film - 
                         Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant 
                         director! Did you see his last film, 
                         The Flower That Drank The Moon? It 
                         was simply glorious!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, no. I missed that one. But what 
                         do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy 
                         movies.

                                     DANA
                         Really? I never really cared for 
                         those. Why does the fat one always 
                         have to be so mean to the skinny 
                         one?

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - EVENING

               It's 9:30 PM. Enid is drawing in her sketchbook. She looks 
               impatiently at the phone. Time passes - it's 11 PM. She can't 
               stand it anymore.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               Seymour picks up the phone. Dana is in the background getting 
               some ice in the kitchen.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... hello?

                                     ENID
                         Hi, it's me...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh, hi...

                                     ENID
                         So, what happened?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (almost whispering)
                         Actually, it's kind of still 
                         happening... she's over here right 
                         now... I think everything's going 
                         pretty well...

                                     ENID
                         What? You're kidding me...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, so I better go -- it's not 
                         really the best time to talk...

                                     ENID
                         What, are you going to like have sex 
                         with her on your first date?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you 
                         later... bye!

               He hangs up. Enid is stunned... Now what? She calls Rebecca.

               INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Rebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone 
               RINGS. She picks it up.

                                     REBECCA
                         Hello?

                                     ENID
                         Do you still want to do something 
                         tonight?

                                     REBECCA
                         What happened to Seymour?

                                     ENID
                              (still shocked by 
                              this)
                         I can't believe it - he actually 
                         scored!

                                     REBECCA
                         How repulsive!

                                     ENID
                         So should I come over?

                                     REBECCA
                         Actually, I'm just about to go out 
                         with some friends...

                                     ENID
                         What are you talking about? Who?

                                     REBECCA
                         Just some people from work...

                                     ENID
                         I don't believe you.

                                     REBECCA
                         Yeah well, you said you were busy... 
                         look, I'd better get going... I'll 
                         call you tomorrow.

               Rebecca hangs up. Clearly, she's not going anywhere.

               EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Enid stands outside Josh's door. A tentative pause; then she 
               knocks. Josh opens the door, stunned. Enid is wearing an 
               uncharacteristically "sexy" outfit.

                                     JOSH
                         Hi... what's up?

                                     ENID
                         Can I come in?

               INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               She goes in and looks around nervously... the note (Tiffany 
               & Amber) is tacked to the wall.

                                     JOSH
                         Are you the one who left that note?

                                     ENID
                         I guess.

               Pause. Enid sits down on futon/sofa.

                                     JOSH
                         So what's up?

               He picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously.

                                     ENID
                         I don't know... I'm totally 
                         confused...

               Josh doesn't respond - there's another awkward pause.

                                     ENID
                         Sit over here.

               He sits, tentatively. Long pause.

                                     JOSH
                         Do you want something to drink?

                                     ENID
                         Why?

                                     JOSH
                         What do you mean "why"?

                                     ENID
                         Are you trying to get me wasted so 
                         you can take advantage of my womanly 
                         charms?

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, right...

                                     ENID
                         "Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's 
                         so wrong with me?

                                     JOSH
                         Nothing.

                                     ENID
                         Then why do you hate me so much?

                                     JOSH
                         When did I say I hated you?

                                     ENID
                         You've never once said anything even 
                         remotely nice to me.

                                     JOSH
                         You make me nervous! I always feel 
                         like you're going out of your way to 
                         make me feel uncomfortable so you 
                         can laugh at me!

                                     ENID
                         That's just the way I am!

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah, well --

                                     ENID
                         It's just my stupid way of getting 
                         attention! God, I practically love 
                         you, Josh!

               Stunned pause, then she bravely leans forward and kisses 
               him.  He kisses back but she is clearly the aggressor... 
               they get more and more into it.

                                     ENID
                         Do you have any protection?

               INT. JOSH'S APT. - 1 AM.

               Later, post-coital on the now unfolded futon... Enid lies on 
               her back, Josh is face-down on top of her with his head to 
               the side. Enid has a blank, disillusioned stare.

                                     JOSH
                              (now he's romantic 
                              and sappy)
                         You must have known all along how I -- 
                         you know -- how I felt about you -- 
                         it must be totally obvious...  God... 
                         I always used to dream about this...

                                     ENID
                              (staring ahead)
                         Why do you have that stupid poster?

               INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - DAY

               It's the next morning. Josh is asleep. Enid, fully awake and 
               dressed, sits on the bed looking at him, thoroughly 
               disillusioned. She pulls out a record from his collection 
               and grimaces. She opens a closet door and finds an electric 
               guitar.

                                     JOSH
                              (waking up, groggy, 
                              happily surprised)
                         Oh, hi...

                                     ENID
                         Why do all guys have to play stupid 
                         guitars? It's so typical... Either 
                         they're into cars or guns or sports 
                         or guitars... it's so obvious...

                                     JOSH
                         How long have you been up?

                                     ENID
                         I couldn't sleep... I should get 
                         going; I feel really weird...

                                     JOSH
                         Do you want to go get breakfast 
                         somewhere?

                                     ENID
                         I don't think we should... Look, you 
                         have to totally promise me you won't 
                         tell Becky about this.

                                     JOSH
                         Why not?

                                     ENID
                         Because if you do, I'll kill you!

                                     JOSH
                         Okay... I promise.

                                     ENID
                         Just take my word for it... if she 
                         ever finds out about this I'll never 
                         hear the end of it...

               INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DAY

               Rebecca is dressed in her best apartment-hunting outfit. She 
               sits on her bed, dialing the phone with the FREE WEEKLY open 
               on her lap. She circles something with her pen while the 
               phone rings.

                                     REBECCA
                         Goddammit, bitch -- where are you?

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM -DAY

               Enid lies perfectly still on her bed, staring at the ceiling 
               while the phone rings.

               EXT. COOK'S CHICKEN INN - DAYTIME

               Establish the restaurant.

               INT. COOK'S CHICKEN INN - DAYTIME

               Seymour sits alone eating lunch. We see Enid approach 
               stealthily from behind.

                                     ENID
                         Boo!

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (very startled)
                         YAAA!

               She sits across from him.

                                     ENID
                         Where have you been? I've been looking 
                         all over for you... I've been 
                         wandering the streets day and night 
                         trying to find you...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Really?

                                     ENID
                         No, actually Joe told me you were 
                         here... so how come you never call 
                         me anymore?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been 
                         really busy...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going 
                         with what's-her-name? Dana?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (he looks nervously 
                              at his watch)
                         Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... 
                         you know...

                                     ENID
                         So, what kind of stuff do you guys 
                         do together? Is she into old records 
                         and stuff?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Sort of... she doesn't dislike any 
                         of that stuff... she's trying, 
                         anyway... actually, we're supposed 
                         to go antique shopping for her 
                         apartment this afternoon...

                                     ENID
                              (not convinced)
                         Sounds good...

               Seymour looks again at his watch.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         We really should get together sometime 
                         soon... I-I'll definitely call you 
                         this week --

                                     ENID
                         What, are you trying to get rid of 
                         me?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No... no, it's just that I should 
                         get going in a few minutes, and --

                                     ENID
                         Aren't you even going to ask me how 
                         I'm doing?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... okay, I guess...
                              (pause)
                         I fucked that guy Josh finally...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...so... is he your boyfriend now?

                                     ENID
                         Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, 
                         of course. I'm weighing several offers 
                         at the present time...

               Suddenly, Dana enters.

                                     DANA
                         Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess 
                         I'm a little early...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Dana! Hi!
                              (pause as the gears 
                              whirl)
                         Uh, Dana... this is Enid...

                                     DANA
                         Hello...

                                     ENID
                         It's great to finally meet you!

               Dana sits next to Seymour, facing Enid.

                                     DANA
                              (looking back and 
                              forth between Enid 
                              and Seymour)
                         How do you two know each other?

                                     ENID
                         I'm surprised he hasn't mentioned me 
                         we're old friends.

                                     DANA
                         Really?

                                     ENID
                         Yes, we're very close... In fact, I 
                         was standing right next to Seymour 
                         the first time you called. If not 
                         for me, he would have never called 
                         you back!

                                     DANA
                         Is that right?

               Seymour begins to stammer some kind of response.

                                     ENID
                              (phony)
                         Oops! Look at the time!  I've got to 
                         run! I'll stop by to see you some 
                         time, Seymour...
                              (then to Dana)
                         It was really great to meet you!

               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

               Enid is in her room getting dressed. Dad enters.

                                     DAD
                         I have some good news for you, 
                         Pumpkin.

                                     ENID
                              (sigh)
                         What is it now?

                                     DAD
                         Are you still looking for a job?

                                     ENID
                         I guess.

                                     DAD
                         Well, Maxine thinks she can get you 
                         a sales job at Computer Station.  
                         Normally you have to have references 
                         and at least two years of experience, 
                         but she thinks she can convince them.

                                     ENID
                         Tell her to forget it - I don't need 
                         her help.

               INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

               A homemade banner reads: "HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD 
               AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE." Along one wall is all the 
               work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract 
               bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn 
               a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three 
               PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn 
               seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for 
               the first time).

                                     DIRECTOR
                         I'm afraid you're simply going to 
                         have to take that painting down.  
                         Several of the parents have 
                         complained.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I will do no such thing.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Then you leave me no other choice 
                         than to remove it myself!

               She marches towards it. Roberta runs after her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I think we should give the artist a 
                         chance to talk to the parents about 
                         her intentions with this piece...  
                         We should be promoting discussion as 
                         a solution, not censorship.

               Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Margaret, have you seen Enid?

               Margaret shrugs "no." ROBERTA looks through the crowd. A 
               college-age news-hack-type with a FREE WEEKLY T-SHIRT snaps 
               a photo of the DIRECTOR removing Enid's painting.

               EXT. SEYMOUR'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING

               Enid, dressed as though for a glamorous date, stands knocking 
               on Seymour's door.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh... uh, hi... What's up?

               INT. SEYMOUR'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

               Enid worms her way past his unwelcoming stance. Seymour is 
               wearing designer stone-washed denim jeans that look ridiculous 
               on him. Joe can be seen in the kitchen.

                                     ENID
                         I'm going to this stupid art show 
                         and I want you to be my date...  
                         There's something I have to show 
                         you...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I don't know. I don't really 
                         think I should...

                                     ENID
                         Of course you should. C'mon, I'm 
                         already a million hours late.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...I better not...

                                     ENID
                              (pause)
                         Well forget the art show... let's do 
                         something else.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I wish I could, Enid, but I 
                         really can't right now... I -- it's 
                         just that I --

                                     ENID
                         Well when can we do something?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just that, well, you know, Dana 
                         just got out of a really bad 
                         relationship and I don't want to 
                         give her the wrong idea... you know...

                                     JOE
                              (walking by with his 
                              sandwich)
                         Don't mind me, I'll just be in my 
                         room.

                                     ENID
                         Where did you get those pants?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh, uh... they were a present from 
                         Dana.

                                     ENID
                         And you like them?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well, you know... what do I know 
                         about clothes... I've never been the 
                         most fashionable guy -- it's nice to 
                         have someone do all the work for 
                         me...

                                     ENID
                              (pause)
                         So that's it? You don't ever want to 
                         see me again?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, of course I do... It's just that 
                         right now I need to --

                                     ENID
                         What's her problem anyway?  Did she 
                         actually tell you you couldn't see 
                         me?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, no... not exactly... she just 
                         doesn't understand how I would know 
                         somebody like you...

                                     ENID
                         What does she mean by that - "somebody 
                         like me"?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Just someone so young...

                                     ENID
                         You must have done something to make 
                         her think you like me.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I... I don't think so.

                                     ENID
                         Does that mean you don't like me?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No, of course not.

                                     ENID
                              (looks him in the eye)
                         So, do you like me, Seymour?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         In what way do you mean?

                                     ENID
                         In whatever way you think I mean.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (not sure what to 
                              say; long pause)
                         I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's 
                         a very jealous person. I just don't 
                         want to screw that up right now... 
                         I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we 
                         can go back to being friends...

                                     ENID
                         I don't think you understand how I 
                         really feel about you, Seymour.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...What do you mean?

                                     ENID
                              (pause)
                         Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother 
                         you any more.

               EXT. ENID'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

               A LONG SHOT of Enid as she walks home alone.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca walk down the street. Both wear landlord 
               friendly J. Crew outfits.

                                     ENID
                         Where are we? This is a weird 
                         neighborhood...

                                     REBECCA
                         It's a totally normal, average 
                         neighborhood!

                                     ENID
                         I just mean it's weird to me...  
                         I've never been anywhere near here 
                         in my life.

                                     REBECCA
                         Josh says this is a really good 
                         neighborhood...

                                     ENID
                         What? When did you see Josh?!

                                     REBECCA
                         He came into work.

                                     ENID
                         Why? What did he say?

                                     REBECCA
                         Nothing.

                                     ENID
                         When was this?

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know! God, don't act so 
                         jealous I only talked to him for two 
                         minutes.

               They walk along in conspicuous silence.

                                     REBECCA
                         Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you 
                         see it?
                              (looks around)
                         That must be it...

                                     ENID
                              (without enthusiasm)
                         Great...

                                     REBECCA
                         What?! It looks totally normal... 
                         what's wrong with it?

                                     ENID
                         I said "great"...

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh yeah, I can tell you really love 
                         it!

                                     ENID
                         Well, what am I supposed to say? "I 
                         can't wait to live in some depressing 
                         shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!

                                     REBECCA
                         There's something wrong with every 
                         single place we look at! Why don't 
                         you just come right out and tell me 
                         you don't want to move in with me?!

                                     ENID
                         Because you'll freak out and act 
                         like a total psycho about it.

               A few passersby stop to watch.

                                     REBECCA
                         You're the psycho! You haven't been 
                         able to deal with anything since 
                         high school ended!

                                     ENID
                         You're the one who's still living 
                         out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!

                                     REBECCA
                              (as she walks away 
                              giving her the finger)
                         FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your 
                         dad for the rest of your life!

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

               Enid is on her bed, crying. Her jacket and shoes are strewn 
               about the floor.

                                     ENID
                         God FUCK YOU TOO!

               We see her Dad standing outside her bedroom. As he enters he 
               tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before 
               she really embarrasses herself. She stops crying and pretends 
               to be asleep.

                                     DAD
                         Pumpkin? What's wrong?

                                     ENID
                              (her back to him, 
                              doesn't move)
                         Nothing.

               Dad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her 
               shoulder.

                                     DAD
                         If there's something wrong I wish 
                         you'd tell me about it...

               Enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of 
               the bed, facing away from him

                                     ENID
                         It's nothing -- it's just some 
                         hormonal thing... don't worry about 
                         it...

                                     DAD
                         I've got some important news to tell 
                         you, but it can wait till later if 
                         you're not feeling...

                                     ENID
                         What?

                                     DAD
                              (speaking slowly and 
                              methodically)
                         Well... as you know, Maxine and I 
                         have been seeing a lot of each other, 
                         and we decided it might be a good 
                         idea for all of us if she came back 
                         here to live at the end of the Summer, 
                         just so we can all get to know each 
                         other and to make sure this is what 
                         we want.

               Enid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before 
               she bursts into tears, utterly defeated.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY

               Enid, determined, walks down the empty halls. She goes into 
               a room marked "Art Class".

               INT. ART CLASS - CONTINUOUS

               Roberta is in there with a bearded EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE.

               They're covering a STUDENT in plaster.

                                     ENID
                         Hi I brought over my application for 
                         the art academy... I hope it's not 
                         too late...

               Roberta, absorbed in her plastering, glances at Enid.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Just a minute...

               Then, realizing who it is...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Enid! I'm so sorry about what 
                         happened.

                                     ENID
                         What do you mean?

                                     ROBERTA
                         The whole business with the art show 
                         and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --

                                     ENID
                         Huh?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?

                                     ENID
                         I didn't check my messages...

                                     ROBERTA
                         Oh my goodness... well, the whole 
                         thing is just ridiculous, and as 
                         soon as the school board is back in 
                         session next Fall I'm going to do 
                         everything I can to help you.

                                     ENID
                         Help me what?

                                     ROBERTA
                         Well they're forcing me to give you 
                         a non-passing grade in the class 
                         because of what happened at the 
                         exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm 
                         sure I'll be able to get you your 
                         diploma in the Fall!

                                     ENID
                              (pause, overwhelmed)
                         But... can I still get that 
                         scholarship to the Art Academy?

                                     ROBERTA
                         I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an 
                         official high school graduate before 
                         I can nominate you.  I had to give 
                         it to someone else...  But I'm sure 
                         next year I can --

               The PLASTER-COVERED STUDENT makes an uncomfortable moaning 
               noise.

                                     EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE
                              (flustered, to Roberta)
                         Hey, can you help me out over here?

               EXT. QUALITY CAFE - EVENING (SAME DAY)

               Enid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the 
               Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING.

               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - LATER

               She continues walking until she's across the street from 
               Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly, 
               a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls 
               up to the stop and Norman gets on.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (ABOUT 11 PM)

               A knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pants, 
               and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and sees 
               Enid. He opens the door.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What are you doing here?

                                     ENID
                         I had to see you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What's up?

                                     ENID
                         Can you at least let me in?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... sure... come in.

                                     ENID
                              (crying)
                         Look, I just need somebody to be 
                         nice to me for five minutes and then 
                         I'll leave you alone.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What's the matter?

                                     ENID
                         Do you have anything to drink?

               Enid goes to look for herself.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... I think there's some root 
                         beer...

                                     ENID
                         What about this?

               She returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be 
                         saving it for our two-month 
                         anniversary. You better not --

                                     ENID
                              (as she starts opening)
                         FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.

               She opens it and drinks straight from the bottle. Seymour's 
               look says: "Oh well, I'm fucked, I give up."

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Enid & Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and 
               drinking out of the bottle.

                                     ENID
                         You need a bigger place - this is 
                         like a little kid's room.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I could never move - I've got too 
                         much stuff.

               Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. 
               She goes over and picks it up.

                                     ENID
                         Where did you get this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Dana bought it when we went antique 
                         shopping. She said it didn't go with 
                         her stuff, so she gave it to me... 
                         she thought it fit in better with my 
                         "old time thingamajigs."

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, how can you stand her?

               Seymour takes another slug off the bottle.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         God, she's going to kill me... this 
                         bottle is half-empty!

                                     ENID
                         That's great! "Half-empty" - that's 
                         what I like about you, Seymour, you're 
                         a natural pessimist!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         If you expect the worst, you're never 
                         disappointed.

                                     ENID
                         What are you talking about? You're 
                         disappointed every minute of your 
                         life.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I'm just being realistic.

                                     ENID
                         At least you're not like every other 
                         stupid guy in the world - all they 
                         care about are guitars and sports... 
                         they're all such fags!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I hate sports.

                                     ENID
                         How come in all that time I was trying 
                         to get you a date, you never asked 
                         me out?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You're a beautiful young girl... I 
                         can't imagine you would ever have 
                         had any interest in me, except as an 
                         amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, but still... it's kind of 
                         insulting for a girl to be ignored 
                         like that.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I mean... of course I... why wouldn't 
                         I want to go out with you?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno... I always feel like 
                         everybody secretly hates me. I'm 
                         just paranoid I guess. I mean, you 
                         like me don't you? We're good friends, 
                         right?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, sure. Of course.

                                     ENID
                              (contemplative pause)
                         ...Maybe I should just move in here 
                         with you... I could do all the cooking 
                         and dust your record collection and 
                         stuff until I get a job.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What about Joe?

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah... and Dana...
                              (says her name with 
                              whiny, disdainful 
                              voice)
                         You were a lot more fun before you 
                         met Dana. You've been acting way too 
                         normal lately... you're a bitter, 
                         twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, 
                         that's why I like you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (more drunk than before)
                         Yeah, well I like you too...

               TEN MINUTES LATER

               The bottle is empty.

                                     ENID
                         You know what my number one fantasy 
                         used to be?

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (pause)
                         What?

                                     ENID
                         I used to think about one day not 
                         telling anybody and just taking off 
                         and going to some random place...  
                         Do you ever think about stuff like 
                         that?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I guess I probably used to when I 
                         was your age.

                                     ENID
                         It would have to be some totally 
                         average day when nobody was expecting 
                         it, and I'd just disappear and they'd 
                         never see me again.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Sounds like a healthy way to deal 
                         with your problems.

                                     ENID
                         You know what we should do? Let's go 
                         get in your car right now and just 
                         take off! We could just drive away 
                         and find some new place and start a 
                         whole new life... fuck everybody!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't think I'm in any condition 
                         to drive.

                                     ENID
                         I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in 
                         a blaze of glory!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         So where would we go?

                                     ENID
                         Who cares? Let's just go... what's 
                         stopping us?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I dunno, I...

                                     ENID
                         I'm serious! I'm just so sick of 
                         everybody! Why can't I just do 
                         whatever I want?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What do you want?

                                     ENID
                         What do you want?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I-I-I...

                                     ENID
                         What's the matter with you, Seymour? 
                         Don't you like me? Be a man for once 
                         in your life!

               She kisses him passionately. He's shocked but kisses back.

               This escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful 
               brevity.

               WE SEE Enid & Seymour, post-coital.

                                     ENID
                         God, Dana's going to kill you!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         ...Do you really want us to drive 
                         away somewhere?

                                     ENID
                         What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I will if you want to.

                                     ENID
                         No... forget it...

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (embarrassingly sappy)
                         I-I never expected anything like 
                         this to happen...

                                     ENID
                         Yeah, well... me neither...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You must know I always... did you 
                         really mean all that about moving in 
                         with me?

                                     ENID
                         I was just thinking out loud...
                              (doesn't want to hurt 
                              his feelings)
                         I mean, you've got this whole thing 
                         with Dana -- I'm not going to let 
                         you fuck that up...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         But, I...

                                     ENID
                         Shhh... I really need to get some 
                         sleep.

               Enid turns her back to him. We see from REVERSE ANGLE that 
               she's only pretending to be asleep. She looks troubled, as 
               though she's just made a big mistake. Seymour puts his arm 
               around her. It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed 
               and happy.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Good night...

               He kisses her arm and goes to sleep.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Seymour wakes up. Enid is gone.

               INT. DANA'S OFFICE - EXPANSION REALTY - DAY

               Dana is on the phone. A lantern-jawed male COLLEAGUE listens 
               in, his head pressed up against hers.

                                     DANA
                              (into phone)
                         It's a thirty-year fixed at five and-
                         a-half...

               Seymour nervously enters her "workspace". Dana is pleasantly 
               surprised - she stops her conversation.

                                     DANA
                              (covering receiver)
                         Seymour! Hello! What are you doing 
                         here?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt 
                         finish your phone call.

                                     DANA
                         We're almost done.
                              (she continues into 
                              phone)
                         Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded.  
                         They've already paid the earnest 
                         money... well, let them bring it up 
                         if they notice it at the final walk 
                         through. Right, great, sounds good!

               She hangs up and high-fives her colleague. They bear-hug.

                                     COLLEAGUE
                         Great job! I'm proud of ya! Well, 
                         I'll check you guys later. I'm gonna 
                         go start the paperwork.

               Colleague leaves; Dana turns to Seymour.

                                     DANA
                         Hey... so, what brings you down here?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- 
                         there's something I feel I have to 
                         say... I uh, I've never said this to 
                         anyone before -- believe me, I've 
                         stayed in horrible relationships for 
                         years just so I wouldn't have to do 
                         this, but I uh...

                                     DANA
                         What are you trying to say?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It's just that I feel like it's maybe 
                         not a good idea for us to keep going 
                         out.

               Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment. Suddenly 
               she breaks down sobbing.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I-I honestly never intended for this 
                         to happen...

                                     DANA
                         Please tell me it isn't that teenager!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Enid and I were just friends. You 
                         know... we feel comfortable around 
                         each other... she really likes my 
                         old records and...

                                     DANA
                         I can't believe this! I thought at 
                         the very least a guy like you would 
                         never pull this kind of shit on me!

               She starts crying again. Seymour awkwardly tries to comfort 
               her.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Dana, I... um...

               Dana pushes him away violently.

                                     DANA
                         You disgusting pig! You're just an 
                         overgrown baby who can't deal with a 
                         woman your own age. You pathetic 
                         weakling! You make me sick!

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - THE SAME DAY

               Enid is now utterly defeated. The phone rings. She lets the 
               machine pick it up. Maxine enters.

                                     MAXINE
                         May I ask what you're doing?

                                     ENID
                         Shhh!

                                     MAXINE
                         I want to know what you think you're 
                         doing, staying out all night and 
                         worrying your father to death!

                                     ENID
                         Oh yeah, like he even noticed.

                                     MAXINE
                         Listen, young lady... I know you 
                         don't like me -- I don't really care 
                         whether you do or not -- but I will 
                         not allow you to treat your father 
                         the way you do.

               We hear Seymour on the machine in the background...

                                     SEYMOUR (V.O.)
                         I really want to talk to you. I've 
                         been thinking about what you said 
                         about moving in here...

                                     ENID
                         I can treat him any way I want to - 
                         I'm an adult! Leave me alone!

               Maxine leaves. Seymour finishes his message. Enid picks up 
               the phone and dials.

                                     REBECCA (V.O.)
                         Hello?

                                     ENID
                         I need to talk to you.

               INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY

               Enid & Rebecca sit at a table. Rebecca is wearing her uniform.

                                     ENID
                         I'm sorry about the other day. I 
                         don't know what's wrong with me...  
                         I really do want to move in with 
                         you.

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know... I was thinking maybe 
                         I should live alone. I decided to 
                         rent that place we looked at. I'm 
                         moving in next week.

                                     ENID
                         Please let me come with you. Please 
                         please please...

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know - I'm not sure it's a 
                         good idea.

                                     ENID
                         Of course it's a good idea... it's 
                         our plan.

                                     REBECCA
                         But how are you gonna pay rent and 
                         everything? You don't even have a 
                         job.

                                     ENID
                         I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise.  
                         If I don't, you can totally tell me 
                         to fuck off.

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE MORNING

               Enid is putting on her shoes. Her Dad opens the door slightly 
               and sticks his head in.

                                     DAD
                         Pumpkin, are you in there?

                                     ENID
                         Are you going to yell at me?

                                     DAD
                         About what?

                                     DAD
                         Yeah, I heard about that.

                                     ENID
                         I was in a horrible mood - tell her 
                         not to worry, I'll be completely out 
                         of her life in a few days.

                                     DAD
                         She understands what you're going 
                         through and she really wants to help 
                         you. She says that job at Computer 
                         Station is still available if you 
                         want it.

                                     ENID
                         I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.

                                     DAD
                         Actually, I was just checking to see 
                         if you were here - your friend Seymour 
                         is on his way up.

                                     ENID
                         What do you mean "on his way up"!?

                                     DAD
                         I just buzzed him in.

               Just then, three sharp KNOCKS on the front door.

                                     ENID
                         What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm 
                         not here!

                                     DAD
                         But I can't --

                                     ENID
                         JUST DO IT!

               Dad goes to answer the door. Enid hides in her room.

                                     DAD (V.O.)
                         I'm not sure when she'll be back...

               Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She 
               has a terribly sad look on her face.

               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" 
               telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert 
               plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's 
               answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes.  
               Joe walks by the doorway.

                                     JOE
                         Well, here's where the fun never 
                         stops!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yeah, I'm really, really happy.  
                         Really having a good time.

                                     JOE
                         Still torturing yourself over that 
                         Enid, huh?

               Seymour doesn't answer. He looks away.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Where else am I ever going to find 
                         another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley 
                         records?
                              (pause)
                         She could at least have the decency 
                         to call me back.

                                     JOE
                         Maybe she was just using you to try 
                         and get back at some guy. Who knows?  
                         It could be a million things. It's 
                         wasted time trying to logically figure 
                         out the female brain, that's for 
                         sure.

               Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space.

                                     JOE
                         Maybe she's got another boyfriend.

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (bummed out, wants 
                              Joe to stop)
                         Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me 
                         up.

                                     JOE
                              (deadpan)
                         No problem.

               Seymour looks so miserable that even Joe has some compassion 
               for him.

                                     JOE
                         Look at it this way - at least things 
                         can't get any worse.

               Joe leaves. Seymour is left listening to the record.

               INT. COOK'S CHICKEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY.

               Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with 
               many doors on both sides. A door opens and a Tony Robbins-
               ish, 35 year-old MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE sticks his head out.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Seymour! Just the man I want to see. 
                         Step in here for a minute.

               Seymour enters.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Have a seat.

               He plunks down the current issue of THE FREE WEEKLY - it's 
               open to a 1/2 page article on page 8 with the headline "Oh 
               Brother!" and a photo of THE PAINTING being removed.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         What can you tell me about this, 
                         Seymour?

               INT. ENID & REBECCA'S NEW APT.

               Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt 
               and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. She's looking around 
               at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment.

                                     REBECCA
                         So, whaddya think?

                                     ENID
                         It's fine.

                                     REBECCA
                         So where's all your stuff?

               Enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc.

                                     ENID
                         There.

                                     REBECCA
                         That's all you're bringing?

                                     ENID
                         I'm gonna finish packing tonight...  
                         I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.

                                     REBECCA
                         What time?

                                     ENID
                         I dunno...

                                     REBECCA
                         Make sure you're here by noon - we 
                         have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! 
                         I have to show you something else!

               She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a BUILT-IN IRONING 
               BOARD as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen.

                                     REBECCA
                         Isn't this the greatest?

               INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE EVENING

               Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her 
               closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside 
               are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes 
               one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening 
               to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs 
               mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's 
               the uniform from her job at "Computer Station." She folds 
               it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange 
               fabric.

               INT. ENID AND REBECCA'S APT. - THE NEXT DAY

               Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.

               She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the 
               time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The 
               machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another 
               tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and 
               goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock 
               on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.

                                     REBECCA
                              (as she opens the 
                              door)
                         What's wrong with you, retard - it's 
                         three-thirty!

               It's Seymour standing there, not Enid.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother 
                         told me I'd find her here?

                                     REBECCA
                         She's not at home?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         No... they said she was here...

                                     REBECCA
                         What the fuck is she doing?! She was 
                         supposed to be here three hours ago!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really 
                         need to talk to her.

                                     REBECCA
                              (allows him to step 
                              inside but leaves 
                              the door open)
                         Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe 
                         she was just hiding from you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Why would she be hiding from me?

                                     REBECCA
                         I don't know... where is she, then?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Maybe she's with Josh?

                                     REBECCA
                         Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I don't know.

                                     REBECCA
                         Why? What did she tell you?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         She just mentioned him a few times 
                         and said that they had been dating - 
                         I thought maybe she was...

                                     REBECCA
                         What? Is she having some secret affair 
                         with Josh?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I have no idea - I just want to...

                                     REBECCA
                         Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no 
                         way! She could never keep that to 
                         herself... you're crazy.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Really, I don't know enough about it 
                         to...

                                     REBECCA
                         That slut!

                                     SEYMOUR
                              (changing subject 
                              back to me)
                         Why did you say she might be hiding 
                         from me? Did she say anything to you 
                         about me?

                                     REBECCA
                              (getting revenge on 
                              Seymour)
                         Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Did she say that?

                                     REBECCA
                         Look, what do you expect?  Considering 
                         how we met you.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What do you mean?

                                     REBECCA
                         On that pathetic fake blind date.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What are you talking about?

                                     REBECCA
                         Didn't she ever tell you about that? 
                         God, she really is pathological...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         What fake blind date? What are you 
                         talking about?

               Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box 
               and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she 
               hands it to Seymour.

                                     REBECCA
                         Here. Read it and weep.

               We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR 
               in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH 
               with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.

               EXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON

               Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into 
               the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.

               INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON

               Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, 
               with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is 
               over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I hope you had a good laugh at my 
                         expense.

               Josh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour.

                                     JOSH
                         Huh... oh... hi... uh...

                                     SEYMOUR
                         You want to see something funny?  
                         I'll show you something funny!

               As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato 
               chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front 
               of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying 
               and gets more and more frustrated.

                                     JOSH
                         HEY!

               Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he 
               creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get 
               into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling.  
               Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with 
               his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked 
               out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.

               The Boss comes out of the back room...

                                     BOSS
                         Josh! What going on here?!

               INT. ENID & REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT

               The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying 
               streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, 
               exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud 
               radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she 
               checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one 
               last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP 
               of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.

               She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a 
               cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over 
               her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

                            TITLE CARD: "SEVERAL MONTHS LATER"

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

               The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades. 
               We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel 
               psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his THERAPIST, a 
               handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I have to admit, things have really 
                         started looking up for me since my 
                         life turned to shit.

                                     THERAPIST
                         So tell me more about this job.  
                         What exactly will you be doing?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Well, mostly archival research, 
                         cataloguing old records and writing 
                         liner notes for their CD reissues.  
                         It's really... I can't believe it.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Remember what I said when we first 
                         started -- this little breakdown 
                         might turn out to be the best thing 
                         that ever happened to you!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         It doesn't pay very much, but I should 
                         be able to afford my own place in a 
                         few months... Do you think that's 
                         too soon? I'm really anxious to get 
                         my record collection out of storage...

                                     THERAPIST
                         Why don't we start with that next 
                         week?

               Seymour looks up. She nods toward the large wall clock behind 
               her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him 
               slowly toward the door.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Thank you, doctor.

                                     THERAPIST
                              (as she opens the 
                              door)
                         Don't thank me. You're doing all the 
                         work.

               A pause. They stand facing each other.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Seymour?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Yes?

                                     THERAPIST
                         Do you have a check for me?

               Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In 
               the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.

                                     MOTHER
                         Seymour? Are you done? Did you have 
                         a chance to think about what you 
                         might want for dinner while you were 
                         in there?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         We can talk about it in the car, 
                         Ma...

               As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the 
               doctor.

               INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville 
               more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood 
               "characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We 
               see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a 
               check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted 
               EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his 
               POWERBOOK to notice.

               She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her 
               receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's 
               style clothes, sitting across from her.

                                     ENID
                         Hi.

                                     REBECCA
                         Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize 
                         you -- I think I need to get glasses; 
                         you're all blurry!

                                     ENID
                              (nodding toward 
                              muscular HIPSTER)
                         You're lucky then, you can't see the 
                         veins on that guy's biceps.

                                     REBECCA
                         Actually, he's a really nice guy.

               We see at this point that Rebecca & Enid are no longer 
               friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.

                                     REBECCA
                         Do you want anything?

                                     ENID
                         Maybe an orange juice.

               Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and 
               saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.

                                     ENID
                         Hey, look what I got...

               She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out 
               her DIPLOMA.

                                     REBECCA
                         Wow... finally.

                                     ENID
                         It just came yesterday...

               Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.

                                     JOSH
                         Hi Enid.

                                     ENID
                         Hey Josh.

                                     JOSH
                         Are you ready to go?

               For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:

                                     REBECCA
                              (still counting 
                              receipts)
                         Yeah, just one second...

               She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind 
               the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.

                                     REBECCA
                              (to Josh)
                         Did you remember to pay the phone 
                         bill?

                                     JOSH
                         Yeah.

                                     REBECCA
                              (to Enid)
                         Call me sometime.

                                     ENID
                         Definitely. We still have to go to 
                         that shoe store sometime.

               Rebecca & Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien 
               world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly 
               stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL 
               BAG at her feet.

               EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING

               We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.

               It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.

               She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It 
               looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands 
               right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered 
               over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: 
               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a 
               FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming 
               Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.

               EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING

               She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm 
               stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by 
               her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She 
               stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect 
               for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the 
               glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.

               She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she 
               has the street all to herself.

               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT

               We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She 
               looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman 
               who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing 
               her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing 
               happens in another window down the street... then another...  
               Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the 
               corner and heads toward her.

               From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus 
               as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment 
               later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves 
               upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the 
               credits roll.

               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

               The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.

ACT ONE
-------
								FADE IN:

EXT. -- A FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT

On the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted
against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON.  The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with
an EERIE SQUEAK.  Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is heard--a cross between a
chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING.

				WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(A CROWING HOWL)

						CAMERA PANS DOWN TO:

CHICKEN PEN

A fenced-in dirt area with numerous CHICKENS milling around, CLUCKING as
they peck at the ground.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(ANOTHER HOWL, nearer now)
		The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.

WERECHICKEN'S POV -- MOVING

A RED-tinted, shaky, MOVING CAMERA TRUCK-IN on the chickens.  (These shots
are in the style of the POV SHOTS in WOLFEN.)  Magnified GURGLING and
HEAVY BREATHING of Werechicken is heard.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)

The terrified chickens stare INTO CAMERA as the Werechicken moves closer,
his shadow falling over them.  They flap into their coop, SQUAWKING
wildly.

INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

MAUDE and ZEKE sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on TV
while munching popcorn from a huge bowl.  They're distracted by CHICKENS
SQUAWKING.

				ZEKE
		Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.

				MAUDE
		Jes' set easy, Zeke.
			(she rises; heads for door)
		I'll take a look-see.

Zeke continues staring at TV.

EXT.  FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT -- WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through the Werechicken's red eyes, we see a distant image of Maude with a
flashlight, approaching the fenced-in chicken pen and opening the gate.
CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN toward Maude as she enters, leaving gate open.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)

ANGLE WITHIN CHICKEN PEN

The dirt compound is empty now as Maude crosses toward wooden chicken
coop.

				MAUDE
			(as she goes)
		Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.

INT.  CHICKEN COOP -- OTS MAUDE

AS Maude ENTERS from OUT OF CAMERA, her flashlight beam illuminates the
chickens cowering on their roosts in a corner.  They CLUCK nervously.

				MAUDE
		What's got you girls so durned upset?
		There a coyote sneakin' 'round?

Suddenly the Werechicken's shadow moves up Maude's back, then the wall.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(Low, gutteral CLU-UCK)

Maude looks over her shoulder AT CAMERA, reacts.

				MAUDE
			(GASP!)

MAUDE'S POV -- THE WERECHICKEN

Red-eyed, grotesque, three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it
stands framed in the moonlit doorway.  It opens its fanged beak in a
horrifying SHRIEK as it springs AT CAMERA, wings flapping.

				WERECHICKEN
			(Frightening SHRIEK)

INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - CLOSE ON TV

Old black-and-white movie.  MELODRAMATIC MUSIC as a man turns into a
werewolf, his HOWL a continuation of the previous Werechicken SHRIEK.

				TV WEREWOLF
			(eerie HOWL)

WIDER ANGLE - ZEKE

continues watching TV and eating popcorn.  Maude walks stiffly into room
behind him, eyes staring blankly.

				ZEKE
			(without looking up)
		Everythin' okay out there, Maude?

WAIST SHOT -- MAUDE

She stares with glassy, red eyes and CLUCKS quietly.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(CLUCKS)

				ZEKE (VO)
		What say?

PAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken
from the feet up.  First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet
sprout.  Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered
body underneath. The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron.  One
foot scratches the floor.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
			(more CLUCKS)

WIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKEN

Now completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on
back of couch, THRUSTING her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl
in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean.  Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless,
as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken.  The
Werechicken looks up from the empty bowl, right in Zeke's terrified eyes.

				ZEKE
			(SCREAMS)

He scrambles backwards off the couch.

EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT - WERECHICKEN'S POV

SCENE RED-tinted.   We hear loud SQUAWKING from within house as chicken
feathers fly out the open windows.

				ZEKE (VO)
			(YELLING)
		Get away!' Scat!  Shoo!

				MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
			(loud SQUAWKING)

CLOSE ANGLE -- WERECHICKEN

Watching from slight hilltop.  Its beak seems to bend into an insidious
grin.

				ZEKE (VO)
			(from distance)
		Help!... He-elp!

								CUT TO:

EXT.  ESTABLISHING -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - NIGHT

As CAMERA MOVES IN, we hear:

				PETER (VO)
		Egon, could you hold off on the weather
		balloon bit for a minute?

							DISSOLVE THRU TO:

INT. -- LABORATORY -- ON PETER AND RAY

They stand holding big plastic bags of trash, obviously annoyed at the
O.S. Egon.  Ray's armful of trash is piled so high that he can't see over
it.  SLIMER hovers behind, sticking his nose in one of the bags like a
dog.  He finally dives right into it.

				PETER (CONT)
		It's Your night to take out the trash.

				RAY
		And Winston's in the kitchen doing your
		dishes.

ANGLE ON EGON

He's busy testing his WEATHER BALLOON--a large, pink bubble half the size
of the room.  He moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon
rises.

				EGON
			(preoccupied; through above)
		Be with you in ...
			(checks watch)
		...one minute, fifty-three seconds.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Peter and Ray exchange pained glances.  Peter awkwardly attempts to pick
up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked.  PAN
WITH THEM as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly
lowers INTO FRAME.  They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash
bags flying.

				PETER AND RAY
			(AD-LIB REACTIONS as they
			bounce off balloon)

NEW ANGLE

Peter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags.
Slimer SQUEALS from within it.

				SLIMER (VO)
			(big muffled SQUEAL)

Then he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body
flat as a Frisbee.

SLIMER

shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter.

				PETER
			(pissed; sarcastic)
		Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!

				SLIMER
		Sorreee!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray helps Peter up as the telephone RINGS and RINGS.

				RAY
			(irritated)
		Egon!  The phone!

ON EGON

The RINGING phone is right beside him on the workbench.

				EGON
			(preoccupied with remote
			controls)
		In a minute, Ray.

ANGLE ON WINSTON

He ENTERS with sleeves rolled up, wiping a plate with a dish towel and
wearing an apron.

				WINSTON
			(sarcastic)
		Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to
		strain yourself.
			(picks up phone)
		Ghostbusters Central.

				VOICE OVER PHONE
			(excited CHATTER)

				WINSTON
		Calm down... Where are you?...
			(a BEAT as he listens)
		We'll be right there.

He hangs up.

WIDER ANGLE

Peter and Ray again have their arms full of trash bags.  Even Slimer is
dragging one.

				WINSTON
		Ready for this one?  Some farmer says his
		wife was eaten by a giant chicken.

				PETER
		Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds
		better than doing Egon's chores.
			(he drops trash bags)
		Let's roll!

Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and EXIT with Peter and
Winston.

REAR VIEW ON EGON

still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room.

				EGON
		I think I've finally perfected it.  Watch
		this, guys.
			(a BEAT, he looks around
			over shoulder)
		Guys?

								WIPE TO:

EXT. -- COUNTRY ROAD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

ECTO-1 roars INTO CAMERA, siren and lights going.

INT. -- ECTO 1 -- MOVING

The Ghostbusters, minus Egon, are wearing their gear.  Slimer hovers in
back seat.

				RAY
		It sure feels strange not having Egon with
		us.

				PETER
			(sarcastic)
		Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's
		not with us.

ON WINSTON

Driving.

				WINSTON
		But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells
		that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be
		a rich man!

ON PETER

Arms folded, grumpily.

				PETER
		Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his
		share of the chores.

EXT. -- ECTO 1 -- NIGHT

As it speeds OUT OF CAMERA toward distant farmhouse, PAN OVER TO the
apron-wearing Maude-Chicken silhouetted in the moonlight, nesting in a
haystack.  MOVE IN TO --

CLOSER ANGLE ON MAUDE-CHICKEN

Her body starts to shake, she ruffles her wings.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(Egg-laying CLUCKS)

Then she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack, revealing an
enormous egg beneath her.  Maude SQUAWKS and CLUCKS and struts off into a
cornfield, pecking away at ears of corn.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(SQUAWKS and CLUCKS)

								CUT TO:

INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Ray, Winston and Slimer listen seriously as Zeke speaks, but Peter's
obviously not buying it.

				ZEKE
		Had big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest
		dang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet
		tall.

Peter rolls his eyes.

				WINSTON
		Shouldn't be hard to find.

RAY

is jotting info on notepad.

				RAY
		Did it have any distinguishing marks?

ANOTHER ANGLE

				PETER
		Ray!  It's six feet tall!

Peter grabs Ray's arm, starts ushering him to front door.

				PETER (CONT)
			(over shoulder as he goes)
		Thank you, Sir.  We'll put out a missing
		chicken report right away.

EXT.  FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

As the three Ghostbusters and Slimer cross toward Ecto-1 parked in front.

				PETER
			(as they go)
		This one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been
		watchin' too many horror movies and eating
		too much greasy popcorn.

CLOSER ANGLE -- MOVING

				RAY
		No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a
		bonafide werechicken here.

CLOSER ANGLE

Peter and Winston stop, look at Ray in disbelief.

				WINSTON
		A werechicken?

				PETER
		Get serious, Ray.

				RAY
		Then explain those!

Ray points at ground.  Peter, Winston and Slimer look down.

THEIR POV

Peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints.

							SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. -- OPEN FIELD -- NIGHT

The three Ghostbusters follow Maude's "chicken" tracks with powerful
flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks.  Slimer moves ahead,
nose to ground like a bloodhound.

				SLIMER
			(SNIFFS as he goes)

ANGLE ON SLIMER

He floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him
right into the haystack.  We hear a BONK from within, then:

				SLIMER (VO)
		Ow!

Slimer backs OUT INTO SHOT rubbing his head.  He looks up and his eyes pop
wide.

				SLIMER
			(amazed GASP!)

LOW ANGLE ON GIANT EGG

The Ghostbusters ENTER SHOT and play their flashlights across the huge egg
sitting atop the haystack.

				RAY
			(excited)
		What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken
		egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!

WIDER ANGLE

As Ray and Winston ease the egg down off the haystack.  Peter holds his
PKE meter up to it.

				PETER
		Look, if this is a werechicken egg,

CLOSER ANGLE -- METER

Nothing registers on the meter.

				PETER (CONT)
		...how come there's no PKE reading?

THREESHOT

Ray and Winston still hold giant egg.

				RAY
			(looking at meter in
			Peter's hand)
		I dunno... that is strange.

				WINSTON
		Let's get it back to Headquarters and run
		some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some
		answers.

ON RAY

				RAY
		Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken
		that laid this has gotta be around here
		someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.

ON PETER AND SLIMER

				PETER
			(throws up his hands with
			heavy SIGH)
		I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer.

They take egg from Ray and Winston and start back toward Ecto-l.

				PETER  (CONT)
			(shaking his head; as he
			goes)
		Werechickens.

WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through its RED EYES we see, from a distance, Peter and Slimer carrying
the egg, Ray and Winston moving off in other direction.

				WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(BREATHING & SLOBBERING)

							SMASH CUT TO:

INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - LAB - NIGHT

Egon still busy with his balloon as Peter and Slimer carry egg in through
door.

				PETER
			(through above)
		Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work
		for you:  How about analyzing this?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Egon looks around, reacts to egg.

				EGON
		Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg
		I've ever seen.

Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk.

				PETER
		I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've
		had a long night in a not-too-fragrant
		barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting
		the sheets.

Peter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in
hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly.  Egon pushes glasses up off tip of
nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it.  CAMERA MOVES IN on
egg and we --

							MATCH-DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. -- FULL MOON IN COUNTRY SKY -- NIGHT

CAMERA PANS DOWN from full moon to reveal the tiny figures of Ray and
Winston approaching an old barn.  They stop, shining their flashlights on
closed main door.

				WINSTON
			(tired)
		Ray, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there
		really isn't any...

				RAY
			(holds up one hand)
		Shh!

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray extends his PKE meter toward barn.  It BEEPS incessantly.

				RAY
			(low voice)
		It's in there.

				WINSTON
			(unclipping his blaster)
		Then let's get it!

INT. BARN -- HIGH ANGLE ON MAIN DOOR -- WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through its RED EYES we see the barn door slowly CREAK open, revealing Ray
and Winston peering in.

CLOSER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON

They ENTER cautiously, Ray holding his BEEPING meter out before him.  The
barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and
the beams of their flashlights.  As the WIND picks up, WOOD CREAKS, HAY
RUSTLES, and a piece of JUNKY machinery turns with a SQUEAL.

				WINSTON
			(WHISPER)
		Man, this place is creepy.

				RAY
			(WHISPER)
		It's in here -- I can feel it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Suddenly the door SLAMS shut behind them and the FLAP OF BEATING WINGS
SCURRIES through the darkness.  Winston JUMPS.

				WINSTON
		Look out!

Ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts.  Its beam catches a couple of
startled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers WHISTLING.

REACTION SHOT -- RAY AND WINSTON

				RAY & WINSTON
			(relieved SIGHS)

WERECHICKEN'S POV

RED-TINTED, moving slowly toward Ray and Winston from behind.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HEAVY BREATHING)

CLOSE ON RAY AND WINSTON

They stop as PKE meter starts BEEPING.  Ray checks the reading.

				RAY
			(whisper)
		Something's close.  Very close.

WERECHICKEN'S POV

Closing on Ray and Winston.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HEAVY BREATHING)

The guys wheel around.

THEIR POV ON WERECHICKEN

We see only its face.  The blood-red eyes stare menacingly, its fanged
beak slightly open and drooling.

				WERECHICKEN
			(HEAVY RASPY BREATHING)

ZOOM BACK TO --

WIDER ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It hops forward into a streak of moonlight.  It's three feet tall, its
wings hang out at the sides, and its evil, blood-red eyes stare at CAMERA.

				WERECHICKEN  (CONT)
			(HEAVY PANTING)

				RAY (VO)
		It is a werechicken!

ANGLE ON RAY and WINSTON

Backing away, blasters leveled.

				WINSTON
		Man, he is ugly!

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It postures, rooster-like and:

				WERECHICKEN
			(ROARS angrily)

ON RAY and WINSTON

Still backing up.

				RAY
		Bad choice of words, Winston.

THE WERECHICKEN suddenly leaps AT CAMERA.

				WERECHICKEN
			(loud SHRIEKING SQUAWK)

WERECHICKEN'S POV

ZOOM-IN on Winston and Ray.  They open fire.

FULL SHOT

The proton streams catch the Werechicken in mid-air as it vaults toward
Ray and Winston, halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton
energy.

				WERECHICKEN
			(SHRIEKS)

A HIDEOUS SPIRIT rises from its writhing body -- shapeless, but with
monstrous glowing eyes and fangs.  The spirit lets out a ROAR more
frightening than the Werechicken howl.

				SPIRIT
			(big ROAR)

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray, still firing his gun, snaps a trap loose from his belt, and tosses it
onto the barn floor.  It POPS open.

				RAY
		Trap out!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray and Winston, struggling with the writhing Spirit caught in the
streams, guide the Spirit into the trap.

				WINSTON
		Hang on!  That's it!

				RAY
		We've almost got him!

CLOSE ON TRAP

The Spirit is sucked into the trap, which SLAMS shut.

WIDER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON

A normal chicken with singed feathers stands where the Werechicken was.
It CLUCKS, starts pecking at the dirt.

				CHICKEN
			(Normal CLUCKING)

				RAY
			(looking at chicken)
		Well, that takes care of one werechicken.

CLOSER ON THE GUYS

Ray picks up the smoking trap.

				RAY (CONT)
		Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's
		wife.

They head for the door.  Winston stops.

				WINSTON
		Ray, I just had a thought...

Ray pauses to look around at Winston.

				WINSTON (CONT)
		What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's
		wife?

And off their looks, we --

								CUT TO:

INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ -KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Egon carries the big egg into kitchen, Slimer helping.

				EGON
			(straining)
		Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't
		have time to examine this egg tonight.  I
		have to prepare for my weather balloon
		demonstration tomorrow morning.

ANOTHER ANGLE

With his elbow, Egon opens refrigerator with and the two of them place the
giant egg inside.

				EGON (CONT)
			(through above)
		But it'll be safe in here.

				SLIMER
		Yeah.

Egon closes fridge.

				SLIMER
			(big YAWN)
		G'night, Egon.

Slimer floats off.

				EGON
		Goodnight, Slimer.

								WIPE TO:

INT. -- BEDROOM

Slimer is SNORING, hovering above Peter's empty bed.

				SLIMER
			(SNORING)

CLOSE ON SLIMER

In a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food
dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' "LA BAMBA" a la the
California Raisins in "I Heard It Through The Grapevine."  Still asleep,
Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and
pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS
the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up.
Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy.

				SLIMER
		Fooooood.

He zips o.s.

INT. -- KITCHEN

Dark.  Lights go on, then Slimer SKIDS to mid-air stop and whips open
fridge.  His eyes pop as he sees the egg.

				SLIMER
			(licking his lips)
		Yummy!

Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg
drives Slimer straight to the floor.  The egg bounces on his stomach twice
before he gets a grip on it.  Straining his little green brains out, he
floats the egg up into the air and o.s.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS, then GRUNTS)

ANGLE ON OVEN

Slimer shoves egg in the open oven, closes door, turns on the heat, then
moves O.S.  The oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver.

ON SLIMER

Slimer HUMS as he busily sets table for one:  placemat, a plate, utensils,
salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish, ... a flurry of activity
that all focuses on his personal eating spot.

				SLIMER
			(HUMMING through above)

ANGLE ON OVEN

Through window we see the egg shake and then begin to crack open.

RESUME ON SLIMER

Hovering at table, still preparing for feast.  He puts on a bib, unaware
of oven shaking behind him.

				SLIMER
			(still HUMMING)

With a loud BANG, the oven practically explodes and the door flies off.
Out pops a BABY WERECHICKEN, SNARLING and CACKLING.

				BABY WERECHICKEN
			(SNARLING, CACKLING)

ON SLIMER

His eyes bug and his paw drops.

				SLIMER
			(startled SCREAM)

Slimer barrels up through sink faucet, leaving his bib stuck in the
opening.

INT. -- SHOWER

Peter shampooing his hair.

				PETER
			(AD LIB SINGING)

Slimer comes shooting out through shower nozzle, hugs Peter tightly around
the neck and scaring the hell out of him.

				PETER
			(startled YELL; then:)
		Slimer!  How 'bout some privacy??

				SLIMER
			(pointing, eyes wide)
		Monster!  Inna kitchen!

				PETER
		Monster?

				SLIMER
			(nods)
		Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!
			(imitates werechicken)
			(SNARLING & CACKLING)

INT. -- LAB

Egon works at his table.  A now familiar Werechicken shadow appears over
his shoulder and grows up the wall.

CLOSER ANGLE - REAR VIEW ON EGON

Werechicken creeps OUT OF CAMERA, bites Egon on the rear and pulls back
o.s., chicken claws CLATTERING off into distance.

				EGON
			(looking around)
		Ow!

				BABY WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(CACKLING fading into
			distance)

ON EGON

Dazed, he looks down at his feet.

CLOSE ON EGON'S SHOES

Chicken toes pop through the leather, one at a time.

				EGON (VO)
			(dazed)
		What?

CLOSE SHOTS

As Egon's transformation continues:  His coveralls RIP apart at the legs,
then midriff, then his arms turn into wings.  Finally, a beak sprouts from
his face.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(Weird CLUCK)

							SMASH CUT TO:

INT. HALL OUTSIDE LAB -- NIGHT

Peter (now dressed and wearing his backpack) runs up to lab door and
flings it open, Slimer right behind him.

INT. LAB

Peter and Slimer look in, not seeing Egon, who is now a six-foot-tall
werechicken, but still wearing his glasses, standing behind door.

				PETER
			(CALLS)
		Egon?
			(to Slimer)
		Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here
		that looks like a monster.

The Egon-Chicken jumps out right in front of Peter and Slimer.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(CHICKEN HOWL)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Slimer freaks and rockets right through the nearest wall.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS as he goes)

				PETER
		Holy cow!!

Peter raises his proton gun.

CLOSE ON EGON-CHICKEN

He flaps his wings wildly, his red eyes bulging, and GROWLS, revealing
impressive fangs.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(LOUD GROWL)

				END ACT ONE

ACT TWO
-------
INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS LAB -- NIGHT

Egon the Werechicken moves toward Peter, fangs bared in attack mode.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(SNARLING as he goes)

ON PETER

He steps back into doorway, blaster leveled at Egon-Chicken, and SNAPS on
the power.  It HUMS to life.

				PETER
			(horrified)
		What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!

				RAY (VO)
		Peter!  Wait!

A hand grabs Peter by the arm fust as the thrower fires, sending the
proton stream off at an angle into ceiling, barely missing the chicken.

				PETER
			(surprised as he looks
			around)
		Hey!

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LAB

as Ray pulls Peter out into corridor, Winston kicks door shut in the
Egon-Chicken's snarling face and quickly locks it.  Slimer hovers nearby
looking worried.

				EGON-CHICKEN (VO)
			(SNARLS)

CLOSE ANGLE

The door SHAKES and SHUDDERS as the unseen Egon-Chicken tries to break
through.

				PETER
			(irritated; through above)
		What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate
		Egon!

				RAY
		Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he
		was bitten and now he's a werechicken!

The door behind them is starting to splinter and bulge from the battering
of the Egon-Chicken.

				PETER
			(looking at door)
		You're kidding!
			(a BEAT, then)
		Come to think of it, there was a certain
		resemblance.

Suddenly the battering stops.

				WINSTON
			(looking toward door)
		What happened?  He's so quiet all of a
		sudden.

ON RAY

Looking toward o.s. window, he reacts.

				RAY
		It's the moon!

He hurries o.s.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray stops at window, looks out.  Beyond we see the full moon.  Peter,
Winston and Slimer come up behind him.

				RAY (CONT)
		Tonight's the first --

CLOSE ON MOON

It's beginning to disappear, right to left.

				RAY (VO)(CONT)
		-- lunar eclipse in ten years!

ON GHOSTBUSTERS AND SLIMER

All looking out window as eclipse continues

				PETER
		Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being
		a chicken?

				RAY
			(turning to others)
		Werechickens only appear during a full
		moon, and for the next few minutes, the
		moon's not full.

INT. LAB -- ON DOOR

Door opens and Ray pecks in.

				RAY
			(tentative)
		Egon?

ANGLE ON EGON

Seen from the waist up (he's not wearing clothes), looking around,
confused.  He sees Ray.

				EGON
		Ray, what is going on?

WIDER ANGLE

Egon is holding his tattered coveralls in front of his waist, like a
skirt.

				EGON (CONT)
		And why am I naked?

Suddenly Slimer flies INTO SHOT and gives Egon a big, sloppy kiss.

				SLIMER
			(as he enters)
		Egon!
			(KISSING SOUNDS)

ON PETER AND WINSTON

				PETER
		Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and
		some bad news.

				EGON
			(as he sits)
		Bad news first.

				WINSTON
		You've been turned into a werechicken!

ON EGON

His glasses slip to the end of his nose as his eyes widen.  He pushes them
back up.

				EGON
		A werechicken?

ON RAY

He hurriedly thumbs through the TOBIN SPIRIT GUIDE.

				RAY
			(flipping through book)
		Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens!
			(reads)
		"The werechicken appears during the full
		moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into
		another werechicken."
			(he looks at Egon)
		That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...

ON EGON

He rubs his rear.

				EGON
			(through above)
		I remember the bite clearly.  How long will
		I stay like this?

ON RAY, WINSTON and PETER

Looking at the Tobin Guide.

				RAY
			(looking in Tobin's Guide)
		According to this, there is an antidote.
		But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse
		only lasts three minutes!

INT. FIREHOUSE KITCHEN

Slimer scrambles through the cupboard, grabbing various bottles of stuff,
and hands them to Winston who adds ingredients to mixing bowl and stirs
while Ray reads from Tobin's Guide.

				RAY
			(reading through above)
		"One tablespoon paprika, one clove of
		garlic, some parsley for color, cup of
		gelatin..."

ANGLE ON WINDOW

Through it we see the eclipsed moon starting to emerge from shadow.

INT. LAB -- ANGLE ON EGON

His pupils look constricted and he's perspiring.

				EGON
			(weakly)
		I don't feel well.

Peter steps INTO SHOT, puts arm around Egon's shoulders.

				PETER
			(through above)
		Take it easy, Egon.  You're gonna be fine.
			(SHOUTS O.S.; worried)
		Hurry it up, guys!

INT.  KITCHEN -- ON WINSTON AND RAY

				RAY
			(reading hurriedly)
		"And one tablespoon of chickenbane."

ON SLIMER

He rummages through shelves, then looks down at Ray.

				SLIMER
			(aghast)
		No chickenbane!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray and winston exchange panicky looks.

				RAY
		Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!

They run OUT with the mixing bowl of liquid.  Slimer follows.

INT. LAB -- CLOSE ON EGON'S LEGS

They're once again turning into chicken legs and chicken feet.  Toes
popping out like popcorn.

				PETER (VO)
			(YELLS)
		Come on, Ray!!

WIDER ANGLE

As Peter and Egon stare down at the chicken legs and chicken feet.

				PETER  (CONT)
			(YELLS o.s.)
		He's changing again!

Ray, Slimer and Winston rush INTO SHOT.

				RAY
			(breathless)
		Quick, Egon, drink this!

Winston hands the bowl of potion to Egon, who gulps it down.

				EGON
			(swallowing, GULPING
			sounds)

As Egon drinks, his arms transform into wings and he drops the bowl,
breaking it.

				WINSTON
		We're too late!

CLOSER -- EGON

As the transformation  and feathers  rise up  his shoulders.  Suddenly,
the transformation  stops at  the neck.   DRAMATIC MUSIC STOPS, too.

ON PETER, RAY, WINSTON AND SLIMER

They stare, wide-eyed.  After A BEAT --

				PETER
		What happened?

WIDER ANGLE

To include Egon, who is once again a six-foot-tall chicken, but with
Egon's own neck and head.

				RAY
		The potion only partly worked, because of
		the missing chickenbane.

				PETER
		Well, we hafta do something!

				EGON
		Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter.
		There's a logical solution to every problem.

				BABY WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWL)

CLOSER ANGLE

Strands of slime stand straight up on the nape of Slimer's "neck" at the
sound -- like a frightened cat -- and he dives into a test tube in a rack
on Egon's workbench.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS as he goes)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

looking around.

				WINSTON
		What was that?

				RAY
		The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still
		out there somewhere.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				PETER
			(to others)
		Let's stop that thing before it makes
		drumsticks out of anyone else!
			(to Egon)
		Un, no offense, Egon.

The three normal Ghostbusters dash toward door.

							SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. -- AERIAL VIEW -- MANHATTAN -- NIGHT

ECTO-2 glides over the city, running lights blinking.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter at the controls.  Slimer sits beside him, looking down at the city
through binoculars.

				PETER
			(into radio mike)
		All quiet on the chicken front.  How about
		down there?

INT. -- ECTO-1 -- MOVING

Winston driving.  Ray on the radio.

				RAY
		Not a peep.

				WINSTON
			(gives Ray a dirty look)
		No pun intended.

EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Several people run out front door SCREAMING as ECTO-1 passes.

				PEOPLE
			(SCREAMING as they exit)

INT. -- ECTO-1 - MOVING

Winston and Ray look back at exiting people.

				WINSTON
		That's it!

Winston cranks the wheel.

EXT.  ECTO-1

As it makes a SCREECHING U-turn.

EXT. -- SUPERMARKET

Ecto-1 SKIDS up, doors open, and Ray and Winston leap out, blasters at the
ready, running toward store entrance.

INT. -- SUPERMARKET

Ray and winston run in and stop inside door beside a panicked BOX BOY who
points o.s.

				BOX BOY
			(breathless)
		It's in there!  A big chicken!  It's gotta
		be ten feet tall!

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray and Winston exchange glances.

				WINSTON
		Ten feet tall?

				BOX BOY
			(nods)
		Maybe fifteen, I dunno.  Big!
			(he runs o.s.)
		I'm outta here!

				RAY
			(to Winston)
		Let's split up.

They run off in opposite directions, flanking the long aisles.

ON RAY

PAN WITH him as he cautiously moves along, aisle by aisle.  At far end of
aisles, Winston can be seen doing the same.  The market is thrashed,
spilled groceries everywhere.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As they reach the last aisle.  No chicken.  Ray joins Winston.

				WINSTON
		How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall
		chicken?

				BUTCHER (VO)
			(frightened SCREAM)

				RAY
		We didn't!  Come on!

They hurry o.s.

INT. MEAT DEPT. -- ON BUTCHER

He's hiding under his butcher block, trembling.  Ray and Winston run INTO
SHOT.  The Butcher looks up, eyes wide.

				BUTCHER
		A giant chicken just came through here --
		it was thirty feet tall!

CLOSER ANGLE

				WINSTON
		Thirty feet tall?

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Butcher is pointing out open door.  Beyond is a parking lot with a
trail of crushed cars right down the middle.

				BUTCHER (CONT)
		Yeah!  Look what it did to those cars!

Ray and Winston race out the door.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - WIDE ON ECTO-2 FLYING -- NIGHT

The little chopper, lights blinking, skims low past three-and four-story
buildings.

				PETER (VO)
			(into radio)
		It's how big?  Okay, Ray, I admit you were
		right about these Werechickens,...

INT.  ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter and Slimer, as before.

				PETER (CONT)
		...but I definitely don't buy them growing
		to the size of buildings.

				SLIMER
		(covers mouth, LAUGHTER FIZZING
		through his closed, flapping lips.
		"How absurd.")

Suddenly, the head of the Werechicken rears up INTO SHOT right in front of
Ray and Slimer.

				SLIMER
			(SCREAMS)

				WERECHICKEN
			(deafening HOWL)

ECTO-2 is buffeted about by the howl as Peter jams the stick forward.

WIDER ON ECTO-2

It makes a steep, banking dive and gets the hell out of there, barely
escaping the big Werechicken's beak that SNAPS shut on thin air just
behind Ecto-2's retreating tail.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter is shaken, but in control.  Slimer is trembling like green Jell-O.

				PETER
			(into mike)
		Ray, you were right!  The chicken's here,
		and he's a walking high-rise!

INT. -- ECTO-1 -- NIGHT -- MOVING

				RAY
			(into radio)
		On our way, Peter.

Winston floors it and he and Ray accelerate forward INTO CAMERA.

INT. BUNKROOM -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - MORNING

Egon is "perched" on the window sill, looking pensively out at the city,
still a chicken from the neck down.  A BEAT, then:

				JANINE (VO)
			(big SCREAM)

				EGON
			(startled CLUCK)

Startled, Egon flutters up off the sill, gravity takes over, and he lands
on his feathered butt.

WIDER ANGLE

Revealing Janine standing frozen in the doorway, eyes wide with disbelief,
hands to her cheeks.

				JANINE
		Egon!  What happened?

				EGON
		It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my
		coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board
		in forty-five...
			(CLUCK)
		...minutes.

ON JANINE

She stares at Egon, totally bewildered.

				JANINE
		But what ...?
			(thinks better of asking)
		Nevermind.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Janine takes a long yellow raincoat off a door hook and helps him into it.
He's completely covered except for his head and feet.

				JANINE
		Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like
		-- this?

				EGON
		Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least.

ANGLE ON EGON

As he struts toward the door, we see his tail protruding through a slit in
the back of coat.  He EXITS, CLUCKING.

				EGON
			(CLUCKING as he goes)

CLOSE JANINE

Staring after him in disbelief.

EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN -- ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It walks along stepping on cars, kicking over telephone poles, etc., a la
Godzilla.  The streets SHAKE.  Panicky pedestrians flee the Werechicken's
giant feet.

				CROWD
			(panicky WALLA)

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter and Slimer are following giant chicken.

				PETER
			(into radio)
		It's heading down 34th toward the Empire
		State Building.

EXT. -- THE STREETS -- DAWN

Ecto-1 SPEEDS around a corner, SIREN blaring.

				RAY (VO)
		Check!  We're almost there.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BLDG. -- DAWN

Sun rises behind the werechicken as it approaches in distance.  With each
HOWL, the streets SHAKE.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWLS)

LOW ANGLE ON ECTO-1

Approaching CAMERA fast, it SCREECHES to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Ray and
Winston LEAP out, open fire, their proton streams angling upward.

LOW ANGLE POV - WERECHICKEN

Moving toward them down the concrete canyon, flattening street lamps and
power poles.  Ecto-2 can be seen flying above and behind it.  The proton
streams are up toward it.

INT. ECTO-2

				PETER
		Take over, Slimer!

				SLIMER
		Roger!

Slimer grabs the control stick in both hands as Peter leans out to one
side with his blaster and fires downward.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

Caught in the three crossing streams.  It FLAILS about, knocking over
street lights and bashing in the sides of buildings, and lets out a
deafening HOWL.  A MONSTROUS SPIRIT emerges from its body and fills the
screen like a transparent film.

				WERECHICKEN
			(enraged HOWLS)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

Ray tosses out the trap.

				RAY
		Let's reel him in!

WIDER ANGLE

As Ray, Winston and Peter's beams draw the Spirit toward the trap.

				SPIRIT
			(angry HOWLS)

CLOSER ON TRAP

Ray's boot stomps on trigger and trap springs open.  As the Spirit comes
into contact with the trap a small STORM ERUPTS around it.  SPARKS and
LIGHTNING BOLTS fly.  A HURRICANE-like WIND BLOWS.

ON RAY AND WINSTON

Being buffeted by wind, struggling to hang onto their throwers as they
continue firing.  They have to SHOUT over the NOISE.

				WINSTON
			(loud)
		Trap's full!  Somebody forgot to empty it!

ON ECTO-2

The wind is really bouncing it around.  Slimer has his hands full, while
Peter continues shooting.

				RAY
			(YELLS)
		Whose job was it?

RAY AND WINSTON

turn to each other.

				RAY AND WINSTON
		EGON'S!

CLOSE ON TRAP

Light FLASHES rapidly.  Trap begins to shake and glow.

				RAY (VO)
		It's gonna blow!

LOW ANGLE -- ECTO-2

				WINSTON (VO)
			(over walkie-talkie)
		Peter, get outa here!

It banks, gets the hell away.

RAY AND WINSTON

turn off their proton guns and are KNOCKED down by the released force as
the freed Monstrous Spirit whooshes skyward.  The STORM abruptly
disappears, as if SUCKED up.  The trap stops shaking and SNAPS shut.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

As the Spirit POPS back into its body, JARRING it.  Its chicken face
contorts with new ANGER.

				WERECHICKEN
			(HOWLS)

WIDER ANGLE

It turns and starts up the side of the Empire State Building.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MORNING

The werechicken is halfway to the top.  PULL BACK to reveal Peter, Slimer,
Winston and Ray standing in street looking up at him.  Ecto-1 and 2 are
behind them.

				PETER
		So how're we gonna, put that big bird on
		ice, guys'

				RAY
			(SNAPS finger)
		Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken
		freezes at very low temperatures!

CLOSER ANGLE

				WINSTON
		Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot
		chicken in August?

A BEAT, then the three guys look at each other.

				RAY, WINSTON & PETER
		Egon's weather balloon!

EXT. -- BUILDING ROOFTOP -- MORNING

Not far from the Empire State Building.  Egon stands before a group of
seated MEN and WOMEN --THE WEATHER BOARD -- in his rain coat.  To one
side, the weather balloon hovers above them.

				EGON
		Distinguished members of the Weather Board,
		my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu-
		capability --

ANGLE ON EGON

The top of the Empire State Building is visible behind him as he holds the
small weather device control box in one winged hand.

				EGON (CONT)
		... of entering the upper atmosphere where
		clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.

ANGLE ON BOARD MEMBERS

They look at each other, puzzled.

				BOARD
			(puzzled MUTTERING WALLA)

RESUME ON EGON

				EGON (VO)(CONT)
		There, it can electronically alter weather
		cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun,
		rain, or...
			(BAWK!)
		...snow.

Ecto-2 ascends into view behind him and hovers, the chopper's rotors
blowing Egon's raincoat up over his head, exposing the chicken body
underneath.

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Their mouths drop open as they stare at Egon's chicken body.

				BOARD MEMBERS
			(excited WALLA)

ANGLE ON EGON

He pulls raincoat down off his face, holding it in place with one hand as
he looks at audience with forced smile.

				EGON
			(to Board members)
		I, er, can explain this, but --

Slimer flies INTO SHOT beside Egon and WHISPERS in his ear.

				SLIMER
			(WHISPERING MUTTERS)

				EGON
		What?

He looks around to where Slimer is pointing.

EGON'S POV

As the Werechicken climbs into view, scaling the upper stories of the
Empire State Building.

				WERECHICKEN
			(distant SQUAWKS)

NEW ANGLE

The Weather Board members see the Werechicken and start to SCREAM.

				WEATHER BOARD MEMBERS
			(SCREAMING)

ON EGON

He JUMPS onto a rope ladder hanging from Ecto-2 and climbs inside.  Slimer
flies in right behind him and Ecto-2 rises up OUT OF SHOT.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Egon settles into passenger seat.  Slimer hovers behind them.

				PETER
			(loud over engine)
		Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with
		your weather balloons

				EGON
			(holds up wings)
		Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.

				PETER
			(nods)
		Piece of cake.

EXT. -- ECTO-2 -- MORNING

It banks off toward the Empire State Building as the Werechicken reaches
the top of the spire.

ON WERECHICKEN

As it gets "comfortable" on the spire, fluffing its feathers.  It begins
to quiver (like Maude did earlier when she laid an egg).

				WERECHICKEN
			(hideous CROW)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

On street below, looking skyward through binoculars.

				WINSTON
		What's it doing?

				RAY
		It looks like it's about to lay an --

Winston puts a hand over Ray's mouth.

				WINSTON
			(with dread)
		I don't want to hear it.

ANGLE ON WEATHER BALLOON

It rises from weather bureau rooftop, then drifts along horizontally, away
from the Empire State Building.  It stops, then begins to rise again.  The
sky darkens as the balloon rises into the clouds.

INT. ECTO-2 - MOVING

Peter, Egon, Slimer, as before.  Peter operates the weather balloon
control box while Slimer flies the chopper.

				EGON
		Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position.
		Turn the lever to the extreme left.

CLOSE UP ON WEATHER CONTROL BOX

Peter turns a lever.

ANGLE ON BALLOON

The balloon and surrounding clouds start to freeze, turning white and
forming ice on them.  Suddenly, snow starts to fall.

ON SLIMER

He sticks his tongue out and catches some snowflakes.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

Blizzard-like snow pelts it.  The chicken begins to stiffen and turn white
with frost.

				WERECHICKEN
			(angry SQUAWKS)

ANGLE ON STREETS

Snow falls on Ray and Winston as they gaze skyward.

				RAY AND WINSTON
		They did it!  All-right!!

They high-five each other.

								WIPE TO:

EXT. FIREHOUSE -- NIGHT

A heavy snow continues to fall as CAMERA MOVES IN

				MAUDE (VO)
			(calls)
		Anyone for dessert?

INT, FIREHOUSE - DINING AREA

Maude (back to normal) emerges from kitchen carrying a large, steaming
bowl.  Seated around the table are Egon (back to normal) Peter, Winston,
Ray and Zeke.  No Slimer.  There are half-empty soup bowls in front of
everyone and the diners all look full to the point of weariness -- except
Slimer.

				EGON
			(raising hand)
		You bet, Maude.

ON PETER

As he looks at bowl of soup Maude sets down.

				PETER
		Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!

ON EGON

spooning soup eagerly into his bowl.

				EGON
		I'm actually starting to like it.

ON MAUDE

				MAUDE
		No more werechicken problems for us,
		eh, Egon?
			(CHUCKLES)

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWL)

WIDER ANGLE

Everyone freezes and looks o.s.

				WINSTON
		Uh-oh.

				RAY
		It came from the lab!

The Ghostbusters burst from their chairs and run o.s.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB

As the Ghostbusters cautiously advance, blasters ready.

INT. LAB -- ON DOOR

It opens and the Ghostbusters peer in.  Suddenly ...

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(another HOWL)

SWISH PAN to ...

A HUGE SHADOW on the lab wall, its head making a "pecking" motion like a
werechicken.  After a beat, PAN DOWN to reveal Slimer with a Walkman on
his head, "pecking" his head to the rhythm of his music.  Slimer HOWLS
again ...

				SLIMER
			(HOWLS)

ON GHOSTBUSTERS

				WINSTON
			(big SIGH)
		It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James
		Brown tape.

ON SLIMER

As he continues to groove to the music.

				SLIMER
			(a la James Brown)
		I feel good!
		I knew that I would
		So good, so good, so good!

			we --)

ON GHOSTBUSTERS

Peter turns to the others in disgust.

				PETER

		Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken
		outfit?

EXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY

A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY

A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The

building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.

						DANA
				 (exasperated)
			Frank, do you think you could give me a hand
			with these bags?

						FRANK
			I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a
			building superintendent.

						DANA
			You're also a human being, Frank.

						FRANK
				 (reluctantly going to help)
			Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the
			hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the
			grocery bags from her.

						DANA
				 (setting the wheel brakes on
				 the buggy)
			Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this
			eventually.

She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.

						FRANK
				 (to the baby)
			Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?

						FRANK
				 (to Dana)
			That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
			Barrett.

						DANA
				 (finding her keys)
			Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to
			fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you
			last week.

						FRANK
			Didn't I do it?

BABY BUGGY

It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

He GURGLES with delight at the movement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY

Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.

						DANA
			No, you didn't, Frank.

						FRANK
			Okay, that's no problem.

						DANA
			That's exactly what you said last week.

BUGGY WHEELS

The brakes unlock themselves.

DANA

She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.

SIDEWALK

Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.

INTERSECTION

Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.

DANA

She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.

BUGGY

It careens toward the corner.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

Its eyes are wide open with excitement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.

BUS

The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.

BUGGY

It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.  The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.

INTERSECTION

Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby.  She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY

THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side.  RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.

EXT.  WEST 77TH STREET - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)

The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished
house.

						STANTZ
				 (all business)
			How many of them are there, ma'am?

						WOMAN
			Fourteen.  They're in the back.  I hope you can
			handle them.  It's been like a nightmare.

						WINSTON
			How big are they?

She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.

						WINSTON
				 (resolute)
			We'll do our best, ma'am.

						WOMAN
			They're right out here.

She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.

						STANTZ
			Ready?

						WINSTON
			I'm ready.

						STANTZ
			Then let's do it.

He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS
between the ages of seven and ten.

						KIDS
				 (disappointed)
			Ghostbusters!!  Boooo!!

Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the
room is strewn with discarded toys and games.  A couple of weary parents
sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.

						WINSTON
				 (trying his best)
			How you doin', kids?

						LITTLE BOY
				 (nasty)
			I though we were having He-Man.

						STANTZ
			He-Man couldn't make it today.  That's why
			we're here.

						BOY
			My dad says you're full of crap.

						STANTZ
				 (stopped cold)
			Well, a lot of people have trouble believing
			in the paranormal.

						BOY
			No, he just says you're full of crap and that's
			why you went out of business.

He kicks Stantz in the leg.  Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.

						STANTZ
				 (low and menacing)
			I'm watching you.
				 (to Winston)
			Song.

Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the
Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing

						STANTZ AND WINSTON
			'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.
			Who you gonna call?'

						KIDS
				 (all together)
			He-Man!!

												 CUT TO:

EXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.

						WINSTON
			That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties.
			I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
			nine-year-olds.

			Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The

They get in the car

INT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

						WINSTON
			Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past.
			Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year
			these kids won't even remember who we are.

						STANTZ
				 (tries to start the car again)
			Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we
			did for this city.

						WINSTON
			Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job
			we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
			man and blew the top three floors off an uptown
			highrise.

						STANTZ
			Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a
			hamburger without chopping up a cow.

He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

INT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)

A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman."  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.

VENKMAN

He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.

						VENKMAN
			Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
			I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
			author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
			Anglund.
				 (to his guest)
			Milt, your new book is called The End of the
			World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about
			gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you
			think anybody wants to read a book about it?

						MILTON
			Well, I think it's important for people to know
			that the world is in danger.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to
			happen or do we have to buy the book?

						MILTON
			I predict that the world will end at the
			stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
			This year?  That's cutting it a little close,
			isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of
			view, the book just came out, right?  So you're
			not even looking at the paperback release for
			maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least
			another year after that if the thing has
			movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
			You would have been better off predicting 1992
			or even '94 just to be safe.

						MILTON
				 (irritated)
			This is not just some money-making scheme!  I
			didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong
			psychic belief that the world will end on New
			Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
				 (placating)
			Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But
			I think my other guest may disagree with you.
			Elaine, you had another date in mind?

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.

						ELAINE
			According to my sources, the world will end
			on February 14, in the year 2016.

						VENKMAN
			Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer.
			Where did you get that date, Elaine?

						ELAINE
			I received this information from an alien.  I
			was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
			a drink in the bar when he approached me and
			started talking.  Then he must have used some
			sort of ray or a mind control device because
			he made me follow him to his room and that's
			where he told me about the end of the world.

						VENKMAN
			Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

						ELAINE
			It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
			up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I
			can't be sure, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (humoring her)
			No, you can't, and I think that's the whole
			problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
			You may get some nice ones occasionally like
			Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
			be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just
			about out of time.
				 (does his wrap-up right TO
				 the CAMERA)
			Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
			pets.
				 (holds up a hairless cat)
			Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
				 (puts a finger to his temple
				 and sends out a though to his
				 viewers)
			... Good night.

INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)

Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.

						VENKMAN
			Where do you find these people?  I thought
			we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
			the spoons?

						NORMAN
			A lot of the better psychics won't come on the
			show.  They think you're too skeptical.

						VENKMAN
			Skeptical!  Norman, I'm a pushover.  I think
			professional wrestling is real.

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Norman)
			What's all this?

						NORMAN
			They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'

						VENKMAN
			The Mayor!  He's a friend of mine.

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.

						VENKMAN
				 (calling to the Mayor)
			Lenny!

The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.

						VENKMAN
				 (starts to follow him)
			Lenny!  It's Pete Venkman!

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (snide)
			Can I help you?

						VENKMAN
				 (dangerous)
			Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.

						HARDEMEYER
			I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant.
			What can I do for you?

						VENKMAN
			I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just
			want to say hello to him.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (scornful)
			I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting
			any ghosts lately?

						VENKMAN
			No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
			about.  We did a little job for the city a
			while back and we ended up getting sued,
			screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (bristling)
			Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall,
			barring a disaster, he's going to be elected
			governor of this state and the last thing we
			need is for him to be associated with two-bit
			frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
			friends.  You read me?

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, I get it.  But I want you to tell Lenny
			that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.

EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors.  Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)

We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence.  Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling.  Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy.  Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.

DANA

She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy.  Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.

						JANOSZ
				 (with an East European accent)
			Still working on the Turner?

Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.

						DANA
			Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
			Janosz.

						JANOSZ
			You know, you are really doing very good work
			here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist
			me in some of the more important restorations.

						DANA
			Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here,
			but now that my baby's a little older, I was
			hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

VIGO PAINTING

At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.

JANOSZ AND DANA

Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.

						JANOSZ
				 (disappointed)
			We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I
			could take you to lunch today?

						DANA
			Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have
			an appointment.
				 (looks at her watch)
			In fact, I'd better go.

She starts gathering up her things.

						JANOSZ
			Every day I ask you, and every day you've got
			something else to do.  Do I have bad breath
			or something?

						DANA
				 (trying to brush him off)
			I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.

						JANOSZ
				 (to himself)
			I think she likes me.

He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign
identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."

INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)

Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.

						DANA
			... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
			dead in the middle of the street

						SPENGLER

			Did anyone else see this happen?

						DANA
			Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't
			imagine this.

						SPENGLER
			I'm not saying you did.  In science we always
			look for the simplest explanation.

An ASSISTANT interrupts.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready, Dr. Spengler

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Assistant)
			We'll start with the negative calibration.

He picks up the device and prepares to test it.

						DANA
				 (curious)
			What are you working on, Egon?

						SPENGLER
			I'm trying to determine whether human
			emotional states have a measurable effect on
			the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a
			theory Ray and I were working on when we had
			to dissolve Ghostbusters.

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Dana)
			They think they're here for marriage
			counseling.  We've kept them waiting for two
			hours and we've been gradually increasing the
			temperature in the room.
				 (checking a heat sensor)
			It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my
			assistant is going to enter and ask them if
			they'd mind waiting another half-hour.

As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.

						SPENGLER
			We'll do the happiness index next.
				 (to Dana)
			I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
			it's all right with you.

						DANA
			Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

						SPENGLER
			Oh no.

						DANA
				 (affectedly casual)
			Do you ever see him?

						SPENGLER
			Occasionally

						DANA
			How is he these days?

						SPENGLER
			Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a
			while there.  Then he crossed the border.

						DANA
			Does he ever mention me?

						SPENGLER
			No.  Not that I can recall.

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.

						DANA
				 (slightly disappointed)
			Well, we didn't part on very good terms and
			we sort of lost track of each other when I
			got married.

The Assistant interrupts again.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready for the affection test.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the assistant)
			Good.  Send in the puppy.

						DANA
				 (continuing)
			I thought of calling him after my marriage
			ended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're
			doing this, Egon

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.

						DANA
				 (handing him a card)
			This is my address and telephone number.
			Will you call me?

						SPENGLER
			Certainly.

						DANA
			Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
			this to Peter if you don't mind.

						SPENGLER
			I won't.

						DANA
			Thank you.

She shakes his hand and exits.

						SPENGLER
				 (to his assistant)
			Now let's see how she reacts when we take
			away the puppy

EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)

It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village.  The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.

						STANTZ
				 (v.o., answering the phone)
			Ray's Occult.

INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS

The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt.  He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe.  As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.

						STANTZ
				 (on the phone)
			Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What
			have I got?  I've got alchemy, astrology,
			apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon
			intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic
			surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie
			sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've
			got it all -- what are you looking for? ...
			Don't have any.  Try the stockyards.

He hangs up.

						SPENGLER
			Who was that?

						STANTZ
			Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come
			up with anything?

						SPENGLER
				 (referring to the book)
			This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a
			flower cart took off by itself and rolled
			approximately half a kilometer over level
			ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.

						STANTZ
			You might want to check those Duke University
			mean averaging studies on controlled
			psychokinesis.

						SPENGLER
				 (going to the stacks)
			Good idea.

The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm
			looking for an aerosol love potion I could
			spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would
			make her unconditionally submit to an unusual
			personal request.

						STANTZ
			Oh, hiya, Pete.

						VENKMAN
			So, no goat hooves, huh?

						STANTZ
				 (strung)
			I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's
			up?  How's it going?

						VENKMAN
			Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and
			buy me a sub?

						STANTZ
				 (slightly evasive)
			Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.

Spengler steps out of the stacks.

						VENKMAN
			Egon!

						SPENGLER
			Hello, Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet
			those science chicks really dig that big
			cranium of yours, huh?

						SPENGLER
			I think they're more interested in my
			epididymis.

						VENKMAN
			I don't even want to know where that is.

Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.

						STANTZ
			Oh, your book came in, Venkman.  Magical
			Paths to Fortune and Power.

He hands Venkman the book.

						VENKMAN
			Great.

			Oh, just checking something for an old friend.

						VENKMAN
			Who?

						STANTZ
			Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!

			Hi, Dana.

Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.

presumptuousness.

						DANA
			Hello, Peter.

			You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you

			I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.

Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on
the baby and the immediate physical environment.

VENKMAN AND DANA

Venkman starts nosing around the apartment.  Dana follows him.

						VENKMAN
			So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he
			ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.

						DANA
			He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems,
			he got a good offer from an orchestra in
			England and he took it.

						VENKMAN
			He ditched you.  You should've married me,
			you know.

						DANA
			You never asked me, and every time I brought
			it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

						VENKMAN
			Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to
			feel loved and desired, too.

						DANA
			Well, when you started introducing me as "the
			old ball and chain," that's when I left.

						VENKMAN
			I may have a few personal problems but one thing
			I am is a total professional.

He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.

SPENGLER

He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby
with a tape measure and calipers.

						VENKMAN
			What are you going to do, Egon?  Knit him a
			snowsuit?

Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.

						SPENGLER
			I'd like to have a stool specimen

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or
			professional reasons?

						VENKMAN
				 (picking up the baby)
			Okay, kid.  Up you go.

He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing
his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.

						VENKMAN
			Help!  Please somebody help me!  Get him off!
			Quickly!  He's gone completely berserk!

Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.

						DANA
			What do you think?

						VENKMAN
			There's no doubt about it.  He's got his
			father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely
			ugly.  And smelly.
				 (resumes playing with the baby)
			You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the
			stinkiest baby I ever smelled.
				 (to Dana)
			What's his name?

						DANA
			His name is Oscar.

						VENKMAN
			Oscar!  You poor kid!

						DANA
				 (losing patience)
			Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you
			think there's anything unusual about him.

						VENKMAN
			Unusual?
				 (holds up the baby and
				 scrutinizes him)
			I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of
			experience with babies.

He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper
off.

			Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't

			We really had some good times, didn't we?

						DANA
			We definitely had a moment or two.

Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.

						DANA
			That's where the buggy stopped.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, let's take a look.

Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.  Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.

						STANTZ
				 (reading the PKE meter)
			Is this the spot?

						DANA
			A little to the left.  Right there!  That's
			where it stopped.

Stantz reads the PKE meter.

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Not a trace.

						SPENGLER
			Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

						VENKMAN
			What's that?

						STANTZ
			Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
			measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
			giga electron volts.

						SPENGLER
			That's a thousand million electron volts.

						VENKMAN
			I knew that.

Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.

						STANTZ
			I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's
			something brewing under the street.

						DANA
				 (worried, to Venkman)
			Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic

			to these supernatural things.

						VENKMAN
			You mean like the time you got possessed and
			turned into a monster terror dog?  No, not

POLICE CAR

It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift

				 (belligerent)
			What the hell's it look like we're doing?
			We're bustin out asses over here 'cause
			some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
			better to do than make idiots like us work
			late on a Friday night, right?
				 (looks to Spengler for
				 agreement)

						SPENGLER
				 (with a "right on" fist)
			Yo.

The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.

						FIRST COP
			Okay, boys, take it easy.

They drive off.  Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.

						SPENGLER
			You were supposed to help me with this.

						VENKMAN
			You need the exercise.

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole.  Suddenly he hits metal.  They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.

						STANTZ
				 (examing it)
			NYPRR.  What the hell -- ?  Help me lift
			this.

They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.

						STANTZ
				 (shining a flashlight into
				 the hole)
			Wow!  It's an old airshaft.  It just goes
			forever.

Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.

						SPENGLER
			Very intense.  We need a deeper reading.
			Somebody has to go down there.

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.

						STANTZ
			Thanks, boys.

They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch.  Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (his voice echoing in the
				 airshaft)
			Keep going -- more -- more --

INT.  HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent
in total darkness.

						STANTZ
				 (using a radio now)
			Lower -- lower --
				 (to himself)
			Gee, this really is deep.

Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!  Steady!

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into
the tunnel below.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT

He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled
Art Nouveau mosaics.  A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION.

STANTZ

He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ
				 (reverently)
			This is it, boys, the end of the line.  Van
			Horne Station.  The old New York Pneumatic.
			It's still here.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.

						SPENGLER
				 (explaining)
			The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an
			experimental subway system.  Fan-forced
			air-trains, built around 1870.

						STANTZ
				 (over the walkie-talkie)
			This is about as deep as you can go under
			Manhattan without digging your own hole.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			What's the reading?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely
high reading.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Off the top of the scale.  This place is
			really hot.  Lower me to the floor.

As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight
down the wall of the station, then onto the floor.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!!  Stop!!  Whoa!!

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze.

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in
the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING
through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,
and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain
-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad
and eerie symphony.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT

						STANTZ
				 (ranting on the radio)
			Oh, my God!  It's a seething, bubbling,
			psychic cess!  Interlocked tubes of plasm,
			crackling with negative GEVs!  It's glowing
			and moving!  It's -- it's a river of slime!!

STANTZ

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he
can.  He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting
the pole.

SLIME

Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet.  He jerks his legs up
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Haul me up, Venkman!  Now!

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's
car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.  A
burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two
cops.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (no nonsense)
			Okay, what's the story here?

Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex
hardhat.

						VENKMAN
			What, I got time for this?  We got three
			thousand phones out in the Village and about
			eight million miles of cable to check.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (not buying it)
			The phone lines are over there.
				 (points to the curb)

Venkman pops Spengler on the head.

						VENKMAN
			I told ya!

Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (filtered)
			Help!  Help!  Pull me up!  It's alive!  It's
			eating my boots.

Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.

						FIRST COP
			You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.
			We checked.  Tell me another one.

Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			Gas leak?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME

Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which
is now bubbling up the shaft after him.

						STANTZ
				 (shouting)
			Get me out of here!!

Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old,
rusting conduit.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping
through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT

One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks
out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
			Sorry.

INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over
the living room.  Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for
information about the blackout.  She listens to a special news report
for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door
and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz
standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of
the hallway.  He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.

						DANA
				 (surprised)
			Janosz?

						JANOSZ
			Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the
			neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to
			see if everything's all right with you --
			you know, with the blackout and everything?
			Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

His affected concern is chilling.  She is frightened but conceals it
from him.

						DANA
				 (mechanically and cautiously)
	We're fine, Janosz.

He tires to look around her into the apartment.

						JANOSZ
			Do you need anything?  You want me to come
			in?

						DANA
			No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks
			anyway.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night,
			Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs
			bite you.

						DANA
			Good night, Janosz.

She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there
staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.

INT.  HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like
headlights and he walks off down the hall.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY

The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the
court to order.

						JUDGE
			I want to make one thing very clear before
			we go any further.  The law does not recognize
			the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe
			in them either, so I don't want to hear a
			lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and
			demons.  We're going to stick to the facts
			in this case and save the ghost stories for
			the kiddies.  Understood?

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.

						STANTZ
			Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?

						SPENGLER
			His nickname is "The Hammer."

Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,
CPA and former demonic possession victim.  Louis is desperately paging
through a mountain of legal textbooks.

						LOUIS
				 (nervous)
			I think you're making a big mistake here,
			fellas.  I do mostly tax law and some probate
			stuff occasionally.  I got my law degree at
			night school.

						STANTZ
			That's all right.  We got arrested at night.

SPECTATORS' GALLERY

Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.

						DANA
			I wish I could stay.  I feel personally
			responsible for you being here.

						VENKMAN
			You are personally responsible.  If I can
			get conjugal rights, will you visit me at
			Sing Sing?

						DANA
			Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.

						DANA
			You mean you cough up hairballs all over
			the rug?

						VENKMAN
			I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.

						DANA
				 (sincerely)
			Good luck.

						VENKMAN
			Thanks.

She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits.  Venkman savors it for
a moment then goes back to the defense table.

PROSECUTION TABLE

Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the PROSECUTOR,
a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties.

						HARDEMEYER
			How are you doing, hon?  Just put these guys
			away fast and make sure they go away for a
			long, long time.

						PROSECUTOR
			It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges.

						HARDEMEYER
			Good.  Very good.  The mayor and future
			governor won't forget this.

He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table
on his way out of the courtroom.

DEFENSE TABLE

The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (gloating)
			Nice going, Venkman.  Violating a judicial
			restraining order, willful destruction of
			public property, fraud, malicious mischief
			-- smooth move.  See you in a couple years
			-- at your first parole hearing.

Herdemeyer exits.  Louis looks devastated.

						LOUIS
			Gee, the whole city's against us.  I think
			I'm going to be sick.

Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first
witness.

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - DAY (LATER)

The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying.

						PROSECUTOR
			Mr. Fianella, please look at Exhibits A
			through F on the table over there.  Do you
			recognize that equipment?

EXHIBIT TABLE

Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three
proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various
meters and detection devices.

						CON ED
				 (o.c.)
			That's the stuff the cops found in their
			truck.

WITNESS STAND

She continues.

						PROSECUTOR
			Do you know what this equipment is used for?

						CON ED
				 (shrugs)
			I don't know.  Catching ghosts, I guess.

						PROSECUTOR
				 (to the Judge)
			May I remind the court that the defendants
			are under a judicial restraining order that
			specifically forbids them from performing
			services as paranormal investigators and
			eliminators.

						JUDGE
			So noted.

						PROSECUTOR
			Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the
			substance in the jar on the table marked
			Exhibit F?

PROSECUTOR

She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the
slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel.

						CON ED
			I been working underground for Con Ed for
			27 years and I never saw anything like that
			in my life.  We checked out that tunnel the
			next day and we didn't find nothing.  If it
			was down there, they must have put it there.

DEFENSE TABLE

Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.

						STANTZ
				 (defensively)
			Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have
			been ten thousand gallons of it down there.

						SPENGLER
			It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal
			source.

						LOUIS
				 (nervously)
			Should I say that?

						SPENGLER
			I doubt that they'd believe us.

Louis moans and goes back to his notes.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER

Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.

						LOUIS
			So like you were just trying to help out
			your old friend because she was scared and
			you didn't really mean to do anything bad
			and you really love the city and won't ever
			do anything like this again, right?

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection, your Honor.  He's leading the
			witness.

						JUDGE
			The witness is leading him.  Sustained.

						LOUIS
			Okay, let me rephrase that question.
				 (to venkman)
			Didn't you once coach a basketball team for
			underprivileged children?

						VENKMAN
			Yes, I did.  We were city champs.

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

						JUDGE
			Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything
			to ask this witness that may have some
			bearing on this case?

						LOUIS
				 (to Venkman)
			Do I?

						VENKMAN
			No, I think you've helped them enough already.

						LOUIS
				 (to the Judge)
			No, I guess not.
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Your witness.

The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.

						PROSECUTOR
			So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court
			why it is you and your co-defendants took it
			upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
			middle of the street.

						VENKMAN
			Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many
			holes already we didn't think anyone would
			notice.

The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.

						JUDGE
			Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in
			contempt.

						VENKMAN
			Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets
			me up like that I can't resist.

						PROSECUTOR
			I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were
			you digging the hole?  And please remember
			that you're under oath.

						VENKMAN
			I had my fingers crossed when they swore me
			in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
			There are things in this world that go way
			beyond human understanding, things that
			can't be explained and that most people don't
			want to know about anyway.  That's where we
			come in.

						PROSECUTOR
			So what are you saying?  That the world of
			the supernatural is your special province?

						VENKMAN
			No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens
			and somebody has to deal with it.

The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

The trial is nearing its end.  The Judge calls on Louis to make his
summation.

						JUDGE
			Does the counsel for the defense wish to
			make any final arguements?

Louis rises.

						LOUIS
			Your honor, may I approach the bench?

						JUDGE
				 (impatient)
			Yes.

Louis crosses to the judge's bench.

						LOUIS
				 (to the judge)
			Can I have some of your water?

						JUDGE
			Get on with it, counselor!

						LOUIS
				 (scared)
			Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --
				 (he remembers there's no
				 jury)
			audience.  I don't think it's fair to call
			my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was
			a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in
			an elevator for about three hours and I had
			to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I
			don't blame them because once I turned into
			a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.

He goes back to the defense table and sits down.  Stantz and Spengler
hang their heads.  Venkman pats Louis on the back.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Louis)
			Way to go.  Concise and to the point.

JUDGE

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.

						JUDGE
			That's it?  That's all you have to say?

						LOUIS
			Did I forget something?

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.

						JUDGE
			That was unquestionably the worst
			presentation of a case I've ever heard in a
			court of law!  I ought to cite you for
			contempt and have you disbarred.  As for
			your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz
			and Egon Spengler, on the charges of
			conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction
			of public property, I find you guilty on all
			counts.  I order you to pay fines in the
			amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to
			eighteen months in the city correctional
			facility at Ryker's Island.

STANTZ

He sees the activity in the jar

						STANTZ
			Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.

THE BENCH

The Judge continues

						JUDGE
			And on a more personal note, let me go on
			record as saying that there is no place in
			decent society for fakes, charlatans and
			tricksters like you who prey on the
			gullibility of innocent people.  You're
			beneath the contempt of this court.  And
			believe me, if my hands were not tied by the
			unalterable fetters of the law, a law which
			has become in my view far too permissive and
			inadequate in it's standards of punishment,
			I would invoke the tradition of our
			illustrious forebearers, reach back to a
			sterner, purer justice and have you burned
			at the stake!

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily.  Then
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.

SPECIMEN JAR

The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz anticipates big trouble.

						STANTZ
			Under the table, boys!

The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.

LOUIS

He stands up and looks around fearfully.

INT.  COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases.  All eyes turn to the
exhibit table.  Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.

JUDGE

He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and
recognizes them immediately.

						JUDGE
				 (in horror)
			Oh, my God!  The Scoleri Brothers!

SCOLERI BROTHERS

Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten
feet tall.  They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still
attached.  Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to
get at the Judge.

JUDGE

Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the
spectral intruders.

						JUDGE
				 (terrified)
			You've got to do something!

						VENKMAN
			Who are they?

						JUDGE
			They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them
			for murder.  They were electrocuted up at
			Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

						VENKMAN
			Maybe they just want to appeal.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.

PROSECUTOR

She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge
with them.

						VENKMAN
			These boys aren't playing around.

						JUDGE
				 (desperately)
			You've got to stop them.  Please!

						LOUIS
				 (thinking like a lawyer)
			Violating a judicial restraining order could
			expose my clients to serious criminal
			penalties.  As their attorney I'd have to
			advise them against it.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They start punching through the jury box.

JUDGE

He is just about hysterical with fear.

						JUDGE
			All right!  All right!  I'm recinding the
			order.  Case dismissed!!
				 (he pounds his gavel on
				 the floor)
			Now do something!

						STANTZ
			Let's go to work, boys.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were
being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

						VENKMAN
				 (slinging the pack onto
				 his back)
			Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

						STANTZ
				 (grabbing other gear)
			Okay, let's heat 'em up!

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers.

						STANTZ
			All right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas
			on stream.

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them.

						VENKMAN
			Hey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own
			size?

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot
lightning at their new adversaries.

						STANTZ
				 (to the others)
			On my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now!

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Spengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and
			work them down and into the corner.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on
the floor.

						STANTZ
			Watch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete.

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of
light energy.

						STANTZ
			Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
			Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him
			down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the
traps which snap shut.

INT.  COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY

LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a
ghost inside each trap.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking the trap)
			Occupado.

INT.  COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE)

He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and
looks around in total amazement.

LOUIS

He crawls out from under a chair.  Reporters and spectators get back on
their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.

PROSECUTOR

She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Brilliant summation.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of
them standing in the wrecked courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Case closed, boys.  We're back in business.

The spectators cheer and applaud.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance.  It's just like the original "No
Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding
up two fingers.  Venkman enters the firehouse.

INT.  BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT

A man and his wife are lying in bed reading.  The man is played by Louis
Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,
is playing his wife.  They are both terrible actors.  Suddenly, a ghost,
actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom.  Janine
sees it and screams.

						LOUIS
			What is it, honey?

						JANINE
			It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know
			what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us
			alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.

						LOUIS
			Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.

He picks up the phone.

						JANINE
			Who are you going to call?

						LOUIS
				 (with a wink)
			Ghostbusters.

As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters
standing in the bedroom.  Their acting isn't much better than Louis and
Janine's.

GHOSTBUSTERS

Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.

						STANTZ
			I'm Ray --

						VENKMAN
			I'm Peter --

						SPENGLER
			I'm Egon --

						STANTZ
			And we're the ...

						ALL
				 (together)
			Ghostbusters.

						STANTZ
			That's right -- Ghostbusters.  We're back
			and we're better than ever with twice the
			know-how and twice the particle-power to
			deal with all your supernatural elimination
			needs.

During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the
fake ghost.

						STANTZ
			Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.
				 (TO CAMERA)
			And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're
			giving you twice the value with our special
			half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.

						VENKMAN
			Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone
			crazy?

						STANTZ
			I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.
			Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,
waiting for his cue.

						SPENGLER
			You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage
			thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids?

He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon.

						STANTZ
			You bet.

As Stantz wraps it up, SUPERS APPEAR at the bottom of the SCREEN: FULLY
BONDED - FULLY LICENSED - SE HABLA ESPANOL.

						STANTZ
				 (TO CAMERA)
			So don't wait another minute.  Make your
			supernatural problem our supernatural problem.
			Call now, because we're still --

						ALL
				 (in unison, mechanically)
			-- Ready to believe you.

Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor.
He sniffs around, following the smell.

			Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really
			big --

He freezes.

INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV

Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing
down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis.

SLIMER AND LOUIS

They both scream and run off in opposite directions.

SLIMER

He passes right through a wall and disappears.

LOUIS

He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry.

						LOUIS
				 (screaming)
			Help!  There's a thing!

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)

Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog
along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.

GHOSTLY JOGGER

A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME)

Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.

STANTZ

He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging
track.

GHOST JOGGER

He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit
concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking his watch)
			You know he ran that last lap in under six
			minutes?

						STANTZ
			If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic
			prospect.

EXT.  JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap
dime-store Santa Claus hats.

						STANTZ
				 (to the client)
			Merry Christmas!

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - ORREFORS GLASS STORE - DAY

The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the
Ghostbusters enter the store.

INT.  ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the
glass shelves and display tables.  Stantz and Venkman are talking to the
manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices
positioned in each corner of the store.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which
throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store.  The manager
watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,
SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.
There is a long pregnant pause.

						STANTZ
				 (to the manager)
			So will that be cash or a check?

												 CUT TO:

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Everyone else has gone home.  Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting
her supplies away.

VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area.  We PAN
DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a
ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk.  Hanging from strings over the desk
are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.

WALL

Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the
chicken bait.  He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to
the chicken.

LOUIS

His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.

						LOUIS
				 (shouts)
			Gotcha!

DESK

The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy.  Slimer
dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down
on Louis's desk.

						LOUIS
				 (seeing the damage)
			Uh-oh.

He slinks off, defeated.

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY

The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security
desk.  Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a
giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE.  Venkman enters.

						VENKMAN
			I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

						SECURITY GUARD
			Room 304 -- Restorations.
				 (recognizing him)
			Hey!  Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.'
			I'm a big, big fan.  That used to be one of
			my two favorite shows.

						VENKMAN
				 (flattered)
			Thanks.  What's the other one?

						SECURITY GUARD
			'Bass Masters.'  It's a fishing show.  Ever
			see it?

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, really great.  Take it easy.

He exits.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer.  Janosz is
at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo.
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the Ver Meer)
			So this is what you do, huh?

						DANA
				 (glad to see him)
			Oh, hello, Peter.

						VENKMAN
			You're really good, you know.

						DANA
			I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it.
			It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about
			ten million dollars.

VIGO

He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.

VENKMAN

Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,
holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.

						VENKMAN
			You know you can go to Art World and get
			these huge sofa-size paintings for about
			forty-five bucks.

He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.

						DANA
			I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk
			about art.

						VENKMAN
			As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell
			you that I haven't forgotten your problem
			and that we're still on the case.

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.

						JANOSZ
				 (smiling at Venkman)
			Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to
			your friend?

						DANA
			Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman.
			Peter, Janosz Poha.

Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.

						JANOSZ
				 (avoiding his gaze)
			Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on
			television.

						VENKMAN
			How are you?
				 (looking over at the Vigo
				 painting)
			What's that you're working on, Johnny?

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to
the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it.

						JANOSZ
			It's a painting I'm restoring for the new
			Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait
			of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled
			most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
			Century.

						VENKMAN
				 (staring at the painting)
			Too bad for the Moldavians.

						JANOSZ
				 (defensive)

			He was a very powerful magician.  A genius
			in many ways and quite a skilled painter.

						DANA
			He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
			I hate this painting.  I've felt very
			uncomfortable since they brought it up from
			storage.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want
			to hang in the rec room.  You know what it
			needs?
				 (picking up a brush)
			A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.

						JANOSZ
				 (with forced good will)
			We don't go around altering valuable
			paintings, Dr. Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			Well, I'd make an exception in this case if
			I were you.

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting
			you.

						JANOSZ
			My pleasure.

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			I may be wrong, but I think you've got a
			little crush on this guy.

						DANA
			Good-bye, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (dragging his feet)
			I'd like to stay, but I really don't have
			time to hang around here.  I'll call you.
				 (calls out to Janosz)
			Later, Johnny!

He exits.

VIGO

Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab
area.

						STANTZ
			Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have
			something really amazing to show you.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Spengler)
			It's not that thing you do with your
			nostrils, is it?

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container.

						STANTZ
				 (to Venkman)
			We've been studying the stuff that we took
			from the subway tunnel.

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.

						VENKMAN
			And now you're going to eat it?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish.

						STANTZ
			Now watch this.

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.

						STANTZ
				 (simulating anger)
			You worthless piece of slime!!
				 (as the slime starts to
				 twitch and glow)
			You ignorant disgusting blob!!

SPECIMEN

It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.

						STANTZ
			You foul, obnoxious muck!!

STANTZ

He continues venting his rage on the slime.

						STANTZ
			I've seen some real crud in my time, but
			you're a chemical disgrace!!

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish.

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They turn to Venkman for his reaction.  He's dumbfounded.

						VENKMAN
			This is what you do with your spare time?

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.
			A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this
			is, it clearly responds to human emotional
			states.

						VENKMAN
			'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff
			and sell it.

						SPENGLER
			We've found it at every event site we've
			been to lately.

						WINSTON
				 (poking at the slime)
			You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad
			vibes'?

						STANTZ
			Like a goat on garbage.

						STANTZ
			We're running tests to see if we can get an
			equally strong positive reaction.

						VENKMAN
			What kind of tests?

						STANTZ
				 (a little embarrassed)
			Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say
			supportive, nurturing things --

						VENKMAN
			You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

Spengler reacts as if he might be.

						STANTZ
			It really responds to music.
				 (to Spengler)
			Let's calm it down.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to
the slime specimen.

SPECIMEN

It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.

						WINSTON
			Does it have any favorites?

						STANTZ
			It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'
			'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small
			World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

						STANTZ
			Watch this.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER"
BLASTS from the speakers.

TOASTER

It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.

VENKMAN

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

						VENKMAN
			I don't care what you say.  This could be a
			major Christmas gift item.

						WINSTON
			Right, and the first time someone gets mad,
			their toaster will eat their hand.

						VENKMAN
			So we'll put a warning on the label.

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the toaster)
			Go ahead.  I dare you.

Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and
easily withdraws his hand.

						VENKMAN
			Just kidding.

INT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

						DANA
				 (talking sweetly to the
				 baby)
			Look at you.  I think we got more food on
			your shirt than we got in your mouth.

BATHTUB

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

DANA

Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub.

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the
bubble bath.

DANA
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed
just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to
his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,
wrapped in a baby blanket.

						DANA
				 (somewhat embarrassed to
				 be there)
			I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?

						VENKMAN
				 (surprised to see her)
			No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
			Come on in.
				 (noting her apparel)
			Are we having a pajama party?

						DANA
				 (upset)
			Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

Venkman looks at her for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd
			have serious doubts.  But coming from you,
			I can't honestly say I'm surprised.

						DANA
			I must be losing my mind.  At the museum
			today I could have sworn that terrible
			painting of Vigo looked right at me.

						VENKMAN
			Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this
			nightgown?

						DANA
				 (distraught)
			I don't know what to do anymore.

						VENKMAN
			I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the
			bathtub.  You better stay here.

He exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the
disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her.

						VENKMAN
			Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts
tying it around him like a diaper.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the baby)
			This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.
			You could get a lot of chicks with this.
			Just don't pee in it.

						DANA
			Peter, what about the bathtub?

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the phone and dials)
			We'll take care of that.
				 (on the phone)
			Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right
			away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
			tried to eat the kid.

						DANA
			It was full of this awful pink ooze.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray)
			Sounds like another slime job ... No,
			they're all right.  They're here now ...
			Right ... Let me know.

He hangs up.

						VENKMAN
			They're going over there right now.  You
			might as well make yourself at home.  Let
			me show you around.
				 (he crosses to the kitchen area)
			This is the cuisine de maison --

It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash.  He grabs a big open
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the sink)
			We may have to wash some of these if you get
			hungry --
				 (he looks in the fridge)
			-- but there's no food anyway so forget
			about it.  I have all kinds of carry-out
			menus if you feel like ordering.

He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then
crosses to the bathroom.

						VENKMAN
			Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy
			up a few things.

						DANA
			Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have
			to do any of this, you know.

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING
and more items going into the Hefty bag.

						VENKMAN (O.S.)
			The shower works but it's a little tricky.
			They're both marked "Hot."  It takes a little
			practice, but at least this one won't try
			and eat you.

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder.

						VENKMAN
			Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.
			But the bed's good and I just changed the
			sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In
			fact, I think you should definitely plan on
			spending the night here.

						DANA
			Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping
			arrangements?

						VENKMAN
			For me it's best if I sleep on my side and
			you spoon up right behind me with your arms
			around me.  If we go the other way I'm
			afraid your hair will be getting in my face
			all night.

						DANA
			How about you on the sofa and me in bed with
			the baby.

						VENKMAN
			Or we could do that.

						DANA
			Thank you.
				 (she picks up Oscar)
			Poor baby.  I think I should put him down
			now.

						VENKMAN
			I'll put him down for you.
				 (taking the baby)
			You are way too short!  And your belly-button
			sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to
			your poor mother!

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.

						VENKMAN
			Did you find anything at Dana's?

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in
			and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up
			some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
			you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the
			Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
			Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

						SPENGLER
				 (reads from xerox of entry)
			"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

						VENKMAN
			A hundred and five years?  He really hung
			on, didn't he.

						STANTZ
			And he didn't die of old age either.  He was
			poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
			disemboweled, drawn and quartered.

						WINSTON
			I guess he wasn't too popular at the end
			there.

						SPENGLER
			No, not exactly a man of the people.
				 (reads)
			"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
			Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
			Unholy."

						STANTZ
			This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in
			all the Black Arts, and listen to this
			prophecy.  Just before his head died, his
			last words were, "Death is but a door, time
			is but a window.  I'll be back."

						VENKMAN
			That's it?  "I'll be back?"

						SPENGLER
			It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.

INT.  MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.

						RUDY
			Hey, Dr. Venkman.  What's going on?

						VENKMAN
			We're just going up to Restorations for a
			minute.

						RUDY
			Oh, I can't let you do that.  Mr. Poha told
			me not to let you up there anymore.

						VENKMAN
				 (with mock seriousness)
			Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but
			I think you can be trusted.  Tell him, Ray.

						STANTZ
				 (very official)
			Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,
			subfusionary flux in this building.

						RUDY
			We got a flux?

						WINSTON
			You got a flux and a half.

						STANTZ
			Now if you don't want to be the --
				 (he counts)
			-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
			from a planar rift, I suggest you get down
			behind that desk and don't move until we
			give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters
head upstairs.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He
rushes over and stops them at the door.

						JANOSZ
			Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.

						VENKMAN
			I know.

						JANOSZ
			Then why have you come?

						VENKMAN
			We got a major creep alert and we're just
			going down the list.  Your name was first.

						STANTZ
				 (to Spengler and Winston)
			Let's sweep it, boys.

They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you
			from, Johnny?

						JANOSZ
				 (nervous)
			The Upper West Side.

						SPENGLER
				 (consulting his PKE meter)
			This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.

						JANOSZ
			What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			We'll know when we find it.  You just sit
			tight.  This won't take long.

STANTZ

Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.

						VENKMAN
			This is the one that looked at Dana.

						JANOSZ
			It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.
			People start imagining things --

						VENKMAN
				 (interrupts)
			I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing
			theory.  If she says it looked at her, it
			looked at her.
				 (to Vigo)
			Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking
			to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking
			to you.

They watch the painting for any sign of movement.

VIGO

His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Vigo)
			Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby.
			Just have fun with it.
				 (to Stantz)
			Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish
			up and get out of here.

						STANTZ
			I'll get one more reading.

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.

VIGO

His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.

STANTZ

He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle
transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks
the spell.

						WINSTON
				 (looking at the painting)
			Now that's one ugly dude.

						STANTZ
				 (coming back to his senses)
			Huh?  What?

						WINSTON
			You finished here?

						STANTZ
				 (distracted)
			What?  Yeah.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?  You coming down with
			something?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for
			a second there.  Let's go.

They head for the door.

JANOSZ

He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.

						JANOSZ
			So you see, everything is in order, is it
			not?

						VENKMAN
			Not.  Don't leave town and report any change
			in your address to the proper authorities.
			We'll be back.

They exit.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.

						SPENGLER
			There's definitely something going on in
			that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus
			and the Giga-meter was showing all red.

						WINSTON
			I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, that's a safe bet.
				 (to Stantz)
			You and Spengman see what else you can dig
			up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.
			Those two were made for each other.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse.  Stantz is at the
wheel.  His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense.  Stantz
swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.

						STANTZ
				 (to another driver)
			Idiot!
				 (honking)
			Move it, you jerk!

Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously
through traffic.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Winston looks at Ray, concerned.

						WINSTON
			Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?

Stantz turns on him.

						STANTZ
				 (viciously)
			Are you telling me how to drive?

						WINSTON
			No, I just thought --

						STANTZ
			Well don't think!

He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue.  Pedestrians leap to safety as
Stantz runs a red light.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.

						WINSTON
				 (to Stantz, really worried
				 now)
			Are you crazy, man?  You're going to kill
			somebody!

Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.

						STANTZ
			No, I'm going to kill everybody!

He swerves off the road.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car heads right for a big tree.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel
and steps across to stomp on the brakes.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car skids into the tree and stops.  The Ghostbusters stumble out
dazed and shaken, but unhurt.  Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the
others, completely at a loss.

						STANTZ
				 (himself again)
			What happened?

						VENKMAN
			You just picked up three penalty points on
			your driver's license.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest
			thing.  I knew what I was doing but I
			couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling
			came over me and -- I don't know -- I just
			felt like driving into that tree and ending
			it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

They inspect the damage to the car.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially, to
				 Spengler)
			Watch him, Egon.  Don't even let him shave.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)

There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman
enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small
suitcase of Dana's.

						VENKMAN
				 (calls out)
			I'm home!

He looks around the large open loft.

						VENKMAN
				 (to himself)
			I knew it.  She cleaned.

He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom.  The door is
half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through
the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling
off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom.

She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.

						VENKMAN
			Are you all squeaky clean now?

						DANA
				 (humoring him)
			Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything
			at my apartment?

She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.

						VENKMAN
				 (through the door)
			Nothing.  They stayed there all night, went
			through your personal stuff, made a bunch of
			long-distance phone calls and cleaned out
			your refrigerator.  And didn't find anything.

Dana opens the bedroom door.

						DANA
			They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub
			... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do
			I do now?

						VENKMAN
			Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a
			babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you
			need it.

						DANA
			I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar
			in a strange place with someone I don't know.

						VENKMAN
			It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's
			one of my most valuable employees.

						DANA
			Does she know anything about babies?

						VENKMAN
			Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?
				 (handing her the flowers)
			Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your
			clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I
			brought along some interesting possibilities.

						DANA
			Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.

She smiles and closes the door again.  He opens the closet and starts
looking for his good suit.

						VENKMAN
			Did you happen to see some shirts on the
			floor in here?

						DANA (O.S.)
			I put them in your hamper.  I thought they
			were dirty.

						VENKMAN
				 (shaking his head)
			I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first,
			okay.  I have more than two grades of
			laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels
			between clean and dirty.

He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.

						VENKMAN
			These aren't so bad yet.  You just hang them
			up for a while and they're fine.

												 CUT TO:
INT.  FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING

Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs.  She starts
primping and freshening up her makeup.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME

Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once
and for all.  He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.

						LOUIS
				 (to himself)
			Okay, Stinky, this is it.  Showdown time.
			You and me, pal.  You think you're smarter
			than I am?  We'll see about that.
				 (loud)
			Oh, hello, Pizza Man!  Oh, two larges!  I
			only ordered one.  Oh, pepperoni and
			pineapple.  My absolute favorite.  I guess
			I'll have to eat these both by myself.

THE CEILING

Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging
upside down.

LOUIS

He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.

						LOUIS
				 (quietly)
			Okay, let's boogie!

He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a
gash across the ceiling.

THE STAIRS

Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and
strikes the wall behind her.  Slimer disappears.

						LOUIS
				 (embarrassed and apologetic)
			Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do
			that.  It was an accident.

						JANINE
			What are you doing up here?

						LOUIS
			I was trying to get that smelly green thing.
			The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the
			fifth Ghostbuster.

						JANINE
			Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if
			you're already an accountant?

						LOUIS
			Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls
			in sick or gets hurt.

Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.

						JANINE
			Have you made any plans yet?  You know
			tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

						LOUIS
			No, I celebrate at the beginning of my
			corporate tax year which is March first.
			That way I beat the crowds.

						JANINE
			That's very practical.  I hate going out on
			New Year's Eve, too.

There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.

						JANINE
			Well, good night, Louis.

						LOUIS
				 (on an impulse)
			Janine, do you feel like maybe getting
			something to eat on the way home?

						JANINE
			I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd
			babysit.
				 (seductively)
			Do you want to babysit with me?

						LOUIS
			Oh, sure, that sounds great.

They exit.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

There is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it.  He's dressed
for the evening and looking very dapper.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing
there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and
miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection
jars and photographic equipment.  They look like they're rigged out for a
major spelunking expedition.

						VENKMAN
				 (ushering them in)
			Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat
			barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?

						STANTZ
			We're going down into the sewer system to
			see if we can trace the source of the
			psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you
			might want to come along.

						VENKMAN
			Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going.
			I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

						SPENGLER
			You know, animals and lower life forms often
			anticipate major disasters.  Given the new
			magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous
			breeding surge in the cockroach population.

						VENKMAN
			Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.
				 (calls out)
			Dana?  The boys are going down under the
			sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon
			thinks there might even be some kind of big
			roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about
			dinner and go with them instead?

Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.

						STANTZ
			Wow.

Dana looks curiously at their outfits.

						DANA
			Hi.

They nod and wave back.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray and Egon)
			I think we're going to have to pass on the
			sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find
			out.

						STANTZ
				 (on his exit)
			Okay, but you're missing all the fun.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)

Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,
guided by a very old map of the underground city.

						STANTZ
			This is it.  Van Horne Station.  Right where
			the old transit map said it would be.

They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.

						STANTZ
			Let's get a sounding on the depth of that
			flow.

Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of
it attached to his utility belt.

						STANTZ
			Stand back.

He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and
casts it out into the middle of the flow.  The plumb bob sinks and
Spengler reads the depth.

						SPENGLER
			Six feet -- seven -- eight --

						STANTZ
			That's it.  It's on the bottom.

						SPENGLER
			Nine feet -- ten --

						WINSTON
			Is the line sinking?

						SPENGLER
			No, the slime is rising.

Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the
platform and around his boots.

						STANTZ
				 (alarmed)
			Let's get out of here, boys.

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.

Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger
than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and
closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his
belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time
but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in
after him.

INT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling
caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.

						VENKMAN
				 (very intimate)
			Here's to -- us.

She sighs and drinks.

						VENKMAN
			So -- are you making any New Year's
			resolutions?

						DANA
			I want to stop getting involved with men who
			aren't good for me.

						VENKMAN
			Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,
			or could you hold off for a few days maybe?

						DANA
			For one night in your life, do you think
			it's possible for us to be completely real?

						VENKMAN
			All right, you want to be real?  So tell me
			why did you dump me?

						DANA
			Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had
			to protect myself.  You really weren't very
			good for me, you know.

						VENKMAN
			I'm not even good for me.

						DANA
			Why do you say things like that?  You're so
			much better than you know.

						VENKMAN
			Thank you.  If I had that kind of support
			on a daily basis, I could definitely shape
			up by the turn of the century.

						DANA
				 (already feeling the
				 effects of the champagne)
			So why don't you give me a jingle in the
			year 2000?

						VENKMAN
			Let me jingle you right now.

He leans over to kiss her.

						DANA
			Maybe I should call Janine.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way
			with children.

They kiss.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.

						JANINE
				 (looking around)
			I can't believe a person could actually live
			like this.

						LOUIS
				 (to the baby)
			So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in
			a small mining operation and then one day a
			beautiful princess came to live with them.

						JANINE
			It's really not a bad place.  It just needs
			a woman's touch.

						LOUIS
				 (continuing)
			So they bartered room and board in exchange
			for housekeeping services, which was a good
			deal for all of them because then they didn't
			have to withhold tax and social security,
			which I'm not saying is right but it's just
			a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can
			finish this later if you're tired.

Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.

						JANINE
			You're really good with children, Louis.  I
			can tell.
				 (as he returns)
			Why don't you come here and sit with me?

						LOUIS
			Okay.

He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.

						JANINE
				 (getting close)
			Motherhood is a very natural instinct for
			me.  I'd like to have a baby myself.
			Wouldn't you?

						LOUIS
				 (gulps)
			Tonight?

EXT.  STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below.  It slides away,
and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.
They are exhausted and covered with slime.

						WINSTON
				 (uncharacteristically
				 angry)
			Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to
			do -- drown me?

						STANTZ
				 (unusually mean)
			Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were
			too stupid to drop that line.

						WINSTON
				 (shoves him)
			You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll
			punch your lights out.

						STANTZ
			Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead
			and try it.

Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.

						SPENGLER
			If you two are looking for a fight, you got
			one.
				 (putting up his fists)
			Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me,
			sucker.

						STANTZ
				 (squaring off)
			Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had
			it with you.

They grab each other and start to tussle.  Suddenly Spengler comes to his
senses and pulls them apart.

						SPENGLER
				 (forcefully)
			Strip!  Right now!  Get out of those clothes!

He starts yanking off his slicker and waders.  Bewildered, Stantz and
Winston start doing the same.  Spengler helps pull off their clothes and
throws them into the open manhole.  Now wearing only long underwear, they
seem to return to normal.

						WINSTON
			What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill
			you.

						STANTZ
			Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff
			is like pure, concentrated evil.

Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the
museum.

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing right to this spot.

			Can I help you?

Stantz looks around and spots Venkman.

						STANTZ
			That's all right, I see him.

They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.

VENKMAN

He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston
coming toward him through the restaurant.

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			You should've been there, Venkman.
			Absolutely incredible!

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, sorry I missed it.
				 (noting their attire)
			I guess you guys didn't know about the dress
			code here.  It's really kind of a coat and
			tie place.

						STANTZ
			It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under
			it actually.

						WINSTON
			Rivers of the stuff!

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing toward the museum.

He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and
lands on a well-dressed diner.

						STANTZ
				 (calls out)
			Sorry!

						DANA
			Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.

Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues
aside.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights.
			Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?

						SPENGLER
				 (to Venkman)
			This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.
			It's hot and it's ready to pop.

MAITRE D'

He hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and
makes straight for Venkman's table.

						MAITRE D'
			Arrest these men.

						COP
				 (recognizing them)
			Hey!  It's the Ghostbusters.  You're out of
			uniform, gentlemen

Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.

						STANTZ
				 (self-conscious)
			Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but
			forget that.  We have to see the mayor as
			soon as possible.

						COP
			Look, Doc, why don't you just go home.
			You'll get a good night's sleep and then you
			can give the mayor a call in the morning.
			Come on.

He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.

						STANTZ
			We're not going anywhere with you.  I told
			you we have to see the mayor now.

						COP
				 (grabbing Stantz)
			I'm warning you.  You can come along
			peaceably or --

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the Cop)
			Hey, don't be an idiot.  This is serious.

						COP
				 (angry)
			Look, pal, keep this up and you're going
			with them.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, yeah?

						COP
				 (has had enough)
			Yeah, let's go.  You're all under arrest.

The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the
restaurant.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Dana)
			Finish your dessert -- it's already paid
			for.  I'll call you.

They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners.

EXT.  ARMAND'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The police car is parked right behind Ecto-2.  Spengler stops at the

						SPENGLER
			Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy.
			This is a matter of vital importance.

Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags.

						COP
			What are you doing?

						VENKMAN
			I just want to get your names right for when

			No, nobody called.

Dana frowns.

						DANA
			Is everything all right with Oscar?

						JANINE
			Oh, he's fine.  He's such a good baby.  He

INT.  GRACIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are
ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors.  The
butler knocks lightly, then opens the door to reveal the MAYOR sitting in
front of the fireplace in his well-appointed private study, flanked by
Jack Hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes.  The Ghostbusters enter.

INT.  STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of

						MAYOR
			All right -- the Ghostbusters.  I'll tell
			you right now; I've got two hundred of the

			You've got two minutes.  Make it good.

						STANTZ
			You get enough negative energy flowing in a

						WINSTON
			Tell him about the toaster.

						VENKMAN
			I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

						MAYOR
				 (shaking his head)
			Being miserable and treating other people
			like dirt is every New Yorker's God-given
			right.  What am I supposed to do -- go on
			television and tell eight million people
			they have to be nice to each other?  I'm
			sorry, none of this makes any sense to me,

The mayor exits, leaving the Ghostbusters to Hardemeyer.

						HARDEMEYER

			That's quite a story.

			Yeah, I think the Times might be interested,

Dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby.
Then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes.

LOUIS AND JANINE

They lean out the window, gaping at the apparition.

EXT.  VENKMAN'S LEDGE - APPARITION

A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling
on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.  Her face looks
remarkably like Janosz Poha's.  The nanny extends her hand to the BABY
who GURGLES sweetly as he reaches out to take it.

DANA

She watches in helpless horror.

						DANA
				 (screams)
			No!!

GHOST NANNY

She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and
smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.

DANA

She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through
the window assisted by Louis and Janine.

						DANA
				 (resolutely)
			Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him

the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the
building.

while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical
Psychiatrist.

						STANTZ
			We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian
			is alive in a painting at the Manhattan
			Museum.

						PSYCHIATRIST
			I see. And are there any other paintings in
			the museum with bad spirits in them?

						SPENGLER
				 (impatient)
			You're wasting valuable time!  We have reason
			to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from
			a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been
			collecting under the city.

						PSYCHIATRIST
			Yes, tell me about the slime.

						WINSTON
			It's potent stuff.  We made a toaster dance
			with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his

			Don't look at me.  I think they're nuts.

baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and

			No harm will come to the child.  You might
			even say it's a privilege.  He will be the

			well, you will be the mother of the ruler
			of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?

						DANA
			If this is what the world will be like, I
			don't want to live in it.

						JANOSZ
				 (confidentially, indicating
				 Vigo)
			I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.

						DANA
			Everybody has a choice.

						JANOSZ
			Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look.
			That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there.
			He's Vigo!

						DANA
			I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my
			baby.

Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,
floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.

DANA

She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power.

						JANOSZ
			You will see.  It's all for the best.

The Ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom, a dingy lounge for patients
in the locked ward.  There is a television set, a Ping-Pong table and a
few tables and chairs.  Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy
wire mesh covering the windows.

						STANTZ
			This is it. boys.  It's starting.  Shit-storm

Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.

			It better not start yet.  I'm trying to

			Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this

						SHERMAN
			I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I

						LOUIS
			Why can't you just have them released?
			You're a doctor.

						SHERMAN
			I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders

						LOUIS
			Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.

						SHERMAN
			Like what?

						LOUIS
			I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

						SHERMAN
			You were the one who got me in.

						LOUIS
			I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she

						SHERMAN
			Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion

						LOUIS
			I'm telling you, we're all going to be in

With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout
psycho-reactive slime.

HOTEL ENTRANCE

A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps
toward the revolving door.  She looks up at the sky and frowns.

						WOMAN
				 (shrewish)
			I told you we should have stayed in Palm
			Beach.  The weather here gets stranger every

						MAN
			Yes, dear.

She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of
her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.  The doorman nods
courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.

WOMAN

She yelps in pain.

						WOMAN
				 (to the doorman)
			Something just bit me!

The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat
comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and
starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.

The name "R.M.S. Titanic" is clearly visible on the side of the huge

While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ectomobile and drive
off, leaving him and Louis standing at the curb.

			Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(LATER)

ECTO-2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum.  Hundreds of
spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters
jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.

EXT.  MUSEUM THEIR POV - BUILDING

The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.
CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,
jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make
a dent.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They size up the situation as they don their proton packs.

						STANTZ
			It looks like a giant Jello mold.

						VENKMAN
			I hate Jello.

They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to
the museum.

						STANTZ
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Okay, give it a rest, Captain.  We'll take
			it from here.

						FIRE CAPTAIN
				 (skeptical)
			Be my guest.  We been cutting here for three
			hours.  What the hell's going on?  You know
			the Titanic arrived this morning?

						VENKMAN
			Well, better late than never.

The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the
Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.

						SPENGLER
				 (monitoring valences)
			Full neutronas, maser assist.

They adjust their settings and prepare to fire.

						STANTZ
			Throw 'em!

They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building
with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the firemen)
			Okay, who knows "Cumbaya?"

A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman
grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.

						VENKMAN
			All right.  Nice and sweet --
				 (starts singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --

Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding
hands and swaying to the music.

						ALL
				 (singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord,
			cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya.

Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that
they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.

						STANTZ
			Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't
			get through this stuff.

						VENKMAN
			Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say
			supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

						SPENGLER
			It won't work.  There's no way we could
			generate enough positive energy to crack
			that shell.

						STANTZ
			I can't believe things have gotten so bad
			in this city that there's no way back.
			Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy.
			And there are too many people who'd just as
			soon step on your face as look at you.  But
			there've got to be a few sparks of sweet
			humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We
			just have to mobilize it.

						SPENGLER
			We need something that everyone can get
			behind, a symbol --

His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a
line drawing of the Statue of Liberty.

						STANTZ
				 (he sees it, too)
			Something that appeals to the best in each
			and every one of us --

						SPENGLER
			Something good --

						VENKMAN
			And pure --

						WINSTON
			And decent.

EXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives
with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor
himself and they cross to the museum entrance.

Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the
Ghostbusters.

						HARDEMEYER
			Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff
			together, get back in that clown car and get
			out of here.  This is a city matter and
			everything's under control.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for
			you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law
			in there and he's got my girlfriend and her
			kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when
			you're partying uptown, this guy's going to
			come to life and start doing amateur head
			transplants.  And that's just round one.

						MAYOR
			Are you telling me there're people trapped
			in there?

						HARDEMEYER
				 (to his assistant)
			This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and
			C.N.N. and get them down here right away.
			When the police bring this kid out I want
			them to hand it right to the mayor and I
			want it all on camera.

						STANTZ
			Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by
			midnight, you're going to go down in history
			as the man who let New York get sucked down
			into the tenth level of hell.

The Mayor stops to consider the situation.

						MAYOR
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Can you get into that museum?

						FIRE CAPTAIN
			If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe.

The Mayor turns to Venkman.

						MAYOR
			You know why all these things are happening?

						VENKMAN
			We tried to tell you last night, but Mr.
			Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony
			bin.

Hardemeyer flips out.

						HARDEMEYER
			This is preposterous!  You can't seriously
			believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the
			Twentieth Century, for crying out loud!
				 (viciously, to Venkman)
			Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff
			is or how you got it all over the museum,
			but you better get it off and I mean right
			now!

He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in
amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily
through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the
slime.

						MAYOR
				 (to Venkman)
			Okay, just tell me what you need.

EXT.  LIBERTY ISLAND (NEW YORK HARBOR) - NIGHT

With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their
equipment.  Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks,
hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators.
Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.

						VENKMAN
			Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

						WINSTON
			Wonder what?

						VENKMAN
			If she's naked under that toga.  She's
			French, you know.

						SPENGLER
			There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons
			of iron and steel.

Stantz is looking worried.

						STANTZ
			I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.

						VENKMAN
			Only one way to find out.

			Ready, Teddy?

They enter the statue.

INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals
straight up 100 feet inside the hollow super-structure of the statue.
Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to
various relays on the interior surface of the statue.  Venkman and Stantz
are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase.
They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks
and gives the order.

						STANTZ
			Okay, boys.  Let's frost it.

They begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive
slime.

						LOUIS
			Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really
			not much to do here and they might need
			some back-up at the museum.

						JANINE
			You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.

She kisses Louis and he gets extremely self-conscious.

						LOUIS
			Uh -- oh -- well, I better hurry.

He rushes out.

statue.

STANTZ

He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer.

						STANTZ
			It's all yours, Pete.
				 (checks his watch)
			There's not much time left.

Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat.

						VENKMAN
				 (giving the downbeat)
			Okay, one, two, three, four --

He hits "Play" on the Walkman and "HIGHER AND HIGHER" BOOMS from the huge
SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior.

INT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to
the rail and manage to keep their feet.

						STANTZ
			She's moving!

			never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I
			finally get here and we're taking her out

Stantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and
starts pushing the buttons.

						VENKMAN
			It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.

						SPENGLER
			With a water temperature of forty degrees

Stantz studies a maritime navigational chart.

						STANTZ
			I'll keep to the middle of the channel.
			We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go
			ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.

			Hi there.  Feel free to try something stupid.

Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.

						JANOSZ
			You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare
			to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't
			you realize what you are dealing with?  He's
			Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to

						VENKMAN
				 (sighs)
			Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from
head to toe, blowing him into the corner.  Then they turn to Vigo.

VIGO

He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the
knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash
his magic powers.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been
neutralized by the good will of the people.

						STANTZ
			Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad

			The whole city's together on this one.  We

			Say goodnight now.

Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.

						SPENGLER
			Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!

			Do it!  Just do it!

Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray.

VIGO

He bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting.

Venkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him.  He
is completely covered with slime and motionless.

Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes.

			Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?

						STANTZ
				 (smiles lovingly)
			Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, no.  We've got to live with this?

They pull him to his feet.

						STANTZ
			I love you guys.  You're the best friends
			I've ever had.

He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils
in disgust.

						VENKMAN
			Hey, I just had this suit cleaned.
				 (indicating Janosz)
			Take care of the wiggler, will you.

Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			What is this -- a love in?
				 (notes the symbols painted
				 on the baby's body)
			Hey, sailor.  I think the tattoos are a

He picks up the baby.

			Finally came to your senses, huh?

They hug and kiss.

SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ

They help Janosz to his feet.  He's dazed but unhurt.

						JANOSZ
				 (restored to normalcy)
			What happened?

						STANTZ
				 (calmly)
			Sir, you had a violent, prolonged,
			transformative psychic episode.  But it's
			over now.  Want a coffee?

						JANOSZ
				 (extremely nice)
			That's very kind of you.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			He's fine, Ray.  Physically intact,
			psychomagnetherically neutral.

						JANOSZ
			Is that good?

						WINSTON
			It's where you want to be.

As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by
Vigo's self-portrait.

						SPENGLER
			Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or
			Brunelleschi.

						WINSTON
				 (staring at it)
			There's something very familiar about this
			painting.

INT.  MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT

It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four
archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.  One holds a harp,
one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword.  Most
remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,
Spengler and Winston.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off.  He waves his
thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.

						LOUIS
				 (to Slimer)
			Okay, so Monday night we'll get something
			to eat and maybe go bowling?  Can you bowl
			with those little arms?

SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.

						LOUIS
			Okay, I have to go save Dana.  I'll see you
			later.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)

The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come
out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.  Everybody starts singing
"Auld Lang Syne."  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and
finds the Ghostbusters.

						LOUIS
			Am I too late?

						STANTZ
			No, you're right on time.

Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him.

EXT.  MUSEUM ENTRANCE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime.  He looks at the
celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (weepy)
			Happy New Year, everybody!

He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)

The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind
the museum, her toga up over her knees.  The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.
The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.

						VENKMAN
			She's all right.  She's just sleeping it off.

						MAYOR
				 (stricken)
			We just had it restored.

						VENKMAN
			This probably isn't a good time to bring
			this up, but the last time we did a job for
			the city you stiffed us.

						STANTZ
				 (handing the Mayor an
				 invoice)
			This is a bill for tonight's job.

The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.

						MAYOR
			What!  This is way too much.
				 (hands the bill back to
				 Venkman)
			We won't pay.

Venkman looks at the Statue.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Stantz)
			I think she looks pretty good here, don't
			you?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.

				MAYOR
		All right, all right.  If you can wait until
		Monday I'll issue you a check.

				SPENGLER
		Sorry.  No checks.  Company policy.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY (WEEKS LATER)

The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she
belongs.  The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.

				VENKMAN
			(looking up at the statue)
		Pretty impressive, huh?

				SPENGLER
			(musing)
		It's probably the first thing my
		grandparents saw when they came to this
		country.

				VENKMAN
		From where -- Neptune?

				SPENGLER
		They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

				VENKMAN
		Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.

				STANTZ
			(in a similarly reflective
			mood)
		My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still
		have the pictures they took of the statue
		from the boat when they arrived.

				VENKMAN
		Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to
		America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I
		recall.  How about you, Winston?

						WINSTON
			My people weren't taking any pictures from
			those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't
			any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome
			them, either.  What are you, Dana?

						VENKMAN
			Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here
			since the year 12.

						DANA
			That's not true.  It was 1620.

						VENKMAN
			Same difference.

						STANTZ
			What's your story, Pete?

						VENKMAN
			Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish,
			some German, some French, Dutch -- the women
			in my family slept around.  And that's what
			made this country great.

						DANA
			That's a terrible thing to say.

						VENKMAN
			So what?  It's a free country.
				 (looking up at the Statue)
			Thanks, Lib.

They all look up at the Statue.

EXT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - HEAD OF STATUE - DAY

Slimer flies out one of the observation windows, THEME MUSIC KICKS IN and
the CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY FROM the island TO a HIGH SHOT of the
Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond.

											FADE OUT.

                         (v.o.) As a girl, you see the world 
                         like a giant candy store, filled with 
                         sweet candy and such. But one day you 
                         look around and see a prison and you're 
                         on death row. You wanna run, or scream 
                         or cry. But something's locking you 
                         up. Are the other folks cows, chewing 
                         cud till the hour come and their heads 
                         roll? Or are they just keeping quiet, 
                         like you... Planning their escape?

                         Hey, Justine. Can I talk to you for 
                         a second?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah.

                         I was just curious. Have you ever been 
                         to a Bible study?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah.


                                     CORNY
                         We got a good one going on every Wednesday 
                         at the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney 
                         comes, Benita comes. You got any interest 
                         in reading the Bible?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have my own, you know, beliefs.

                         We don't preach fire and brimstone. 
                         Just the Ten Commandments. Were not 
                         interested in scaring people. Were 
                         about loving Jesus.

                         I kinda like my nights to myself.

                         Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal 
                         hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you. 
                         Drive safe.

                         Why?

                         Phil. Y'all got paint all over it. This

                         Like sitting on my couch with your big

                         Oh, come on! A little pancake, eyeliner, 
                         mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder 
                         it up. Then you take a moist tissue, 
                         roll it in a ball and toss it in their 
                         face! Jeez, Louise... I'm talking to a 
                         tree stump! Girl, where are you?!

                         It's the food you eat, Justine. Look 
                         at me. I am 10 years older than you 
                         and have 10 times your energy. Cause 
                         I don't eat meat and I don't eat dairy. 
                         It's probably why you can't get pregnant, 
                         honey. And why you have that hung-jaw 
                         look on your face. It's the cheese in 
                         your pizza and the chicken in your salad.

                         I went to the doctor. He says I'm fertile. 
                         He says I could repopulate the entire 
                         planet.

                         Then what's the deal here? Did he say 
                         you get enough vitamins?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         He didn't say.

                         You could make paint where, at different 
                         angles, the house is different colours. 
                         You stand at the front door and the 
                         house is red. You stand at the street 
                         and the house is green. Or you could 
                         make, like, an invisible paint. Make 
                         the whole house disappear.

                         What would be really neat is a paint 
                         that could change the molecular structure 
                         of a house, like a chemical acid deal.

                         Well I'm not a pagen but thanks all 
                         the same.
 

                                     GWEN
                         Which ankle did you twist, Holden?
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         My, uh, left.


                                     GWEN
                         Maybe you should put some cold water 
                         on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Okay.


               


                                     JUSTINE
                         You're a writer so you have yourself 
                         a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine 
                         other cities, other jobs I could have. 
                         Other husbands. Now I don't even know 
                         what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have 
                         a husband.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         You said he was a pig.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Well, Holden. I don't want to hurt anybody.
 
                         

               


               (TV sounds)


                                     PHIL
                         I was thinking about what you were sayin' 
                         about my sperm bein' low. I mean, I 
                         know I got good sperm. It's baby-makin 
                         sperm. I suppose it couldn't hurt to 
                         have it confirmed by an expert.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh who gives a shit, who needs a F&$%' 
                         baby around here anyways? If you wanna 
                         make yourself useful, why don't you 
                         get that goddamn TV fixed?!
 

                                     PHIL
                         What the hell?


                                     JUSTINE
                         It sounds like a helicopter is landin' 
                         in here.
 

               


                                     GWEN
                         You want a blackberry, honey? A man 
                         was sellin' 'em on the road.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         No thank you.


                                     CORNY
                         This is for you Justine. It's from Holden.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Well where is he?


                                     CORNY
                         He's got the day off. He came by this 
                         morning with it.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Thanks.


                                     CORNY
                         Don't mention it. Hey, Gwen.


                                     GWEN
                         Hey sugar.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be 
                         quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last 
                         two days have been the most god-awful 
                         days of my life. I've not been able 
                         to get rid of you in my head. I never 
                         wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted 
                         many things. I'd given up long ago on 
                         being gotten by someone else, and then 
                         you came along. The idea of being gotten, 
                         because of circumstance, will never 
                         get got is the worst feeling I've ever 
                         felt, and I have felt many bad feelings. 
                         I'm sorry I can never see you again, 
                         Justine, forgive me for being so weak, 
                         but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden 
                         Wurther. If for some reason, you could 
                         change your mind and want to be with 
                         me, body and soul, meet me after work. 
                         I will be waiting for you at five PM 
                         outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not 
                         there at five, you will never see me 
                         in your lifetime.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Gwen? What's wrong?

                                     JUSTINE
                         Gwen? Gwen you sick?


                                     JACK

                         here? Gwen, you sick? We gotta get her 
                         to a hospital. Justine you drive her.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Well what time is it?


                                     JACK

                         be somewhere?

                         Gwen?


                                     GWEN
                         Oh, I had a dream. I had dream that 
                         I sprouted a beard made of bean sprouts.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'm gonna let you off here, okay?


                                     GWEN
                         Okay,You'll meet me inside?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm 
                         gonna park the car, then I'm gonna meet 
                         you inside.
 

                                     GWEN
                         Okay. Your a doll.


               


                                     HOLDEN
                         Hey. Oh god, I'm really glad you came.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         I just ditched Gwen at the hospital.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Oh god, thank god.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Where are we goin'?

                                     HOLDEN
                         Let's just park somewhere.


                                     JUSTINE
                         This isn't well planned.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Look. I don't know. I don't care I just 
                         wanna hold you.

               (Justine and Holden are in the hotel room and make love.)


               


               (after the made love)


                                     JUSTINE
                         I can't do it.

                                     JUSTINE
                         I don't wanna... I don't wanna go.

                         Hey.


                                     JUTSINE
                         Hey.


                                     PHIL
                         Were you been?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin' 
                         up all over the store. I had to take 
                         her to the hositpal, and sat with her.
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         Did she sick up on you?


                                     JUSTINE
                         No.


                                     PHIL
                         Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles)
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's not funny, Phil, this is serious. 
                         I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too. 
                         And the next day.
 

               


                                     JACK
                         Justine? What happened to you?


                                     JUSTINE
                         What?


                                     JACK
                         I went down to St. Catherine's to check 
                         up on Gwen. I looked all over for you, 
                         she was askin' for you.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Well, how is she?


                                     JACK
                         She was heavin' up until there was nothin' 
                         left to heave. Doctor said she must've 
                         eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite 
                         in it or somethin'.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I bet it was those blackberries.


                                     JACK
                         They're gonna keep her in there until 
                         she gets better so you're gonna have 
                         to supervise cosmetics.
 

               


               (there they go again)


                                     JUSTINE
                         Stop it, somebody's gonna see!


                                     HOLDEN
                         Who cares, I don't care. I crave you. 
                         I wanna know everything about you. Who 
                         are you?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas 
                         when I was eleven. My daddy was in the 
                         Air Force.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I wanna knock open your head and see 
                         what's inside. I've had so much pain 
                         in my life. I know you have too, I can 
                         see it.
 

                (at the hotel, in bed, 
               probably after they made love)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Holden gave me two of his stories to 
                         read. It's like what a story would be. 
                         I was about a boy who was put upon, 
                         his mother was cold and selfish, and 
                         his father wanted him to play football. 
                         Other people didn't get him, especially 
                         girls. Then the boy comes to believe 
                         no one can ever really know him. So 
                         he starts actin' out, drinkin', and 
                         doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end 
                         the boy kills himself but jumpin' over 
                         abridge. The second story was pretty 
                         much the same as the first. Except at 
                         the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' 
                         a bottle of bug poison.

                         Your stories are intense.


                                     HOLDEN
                         I just wanna leave some kind of legacy. 
                         Somethin' great. After that I don't 
                         care what happens to me.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Don't say that. I wish there was a story 
                         about me. I don't know who would read 
                         it though.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I would.


                                     JUSTINE
                         I like this. I like havin' a secret. 
                         You gave me a secret Holden.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious. 
                         And dark and twisted.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'm going to hell, aren't I?


                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, you are.


               (she rolls on top of him and they kiss)


               


               (they exit the hotel and Justine sees a car)


                                     JUSTINE
                         That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car. 
                         Phil takes that truck to work everyday. 
                         Bubba picks him up, and drops him off. 
                         Why, why would that truck be parked 
                         there?
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I don't know.


                                     JUSTINE
                         If he finds out about us....


                                     HOLDEN
                         I won't let him hurt you.


                                     JUSTINE
                         He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll 
                         beat me, but he'll kill you.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         You can't worry about somethin' that 
                         hasn't even happened yet.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I gotta go to the hospital.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Okay. (leans in to kiss her; she pulls 
                         away)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Don't! I mean he could be followin' 
                         us.
 

               


                                     CORNY
                         Justine! Poor lady. She just passed.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Who?


                                     CORNY
                         Gwen! She just passed away.


                                     JUSTINE
                         What do you mean? I thought she had 
                         a stomach ache?
 

                                     CORNY
                         It got worse. She was on life support 
                         all day.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I don't understand.


                                     CORNY
                         It's God's will, Justine. No one can 
                         understand it. It was just Gwen's time 
                         to fly away home.
 

               (Justine looks guilty and shocked)


               


                                     JUSTINE
                         Gwen died today.


                                     PHIL
                         What? Are you kiddin? What for?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Parasite. Somethin' she ate.


                                     PHIL
                         You okay?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Where were you this afternoon?


                                     PHIL
                         Paintin' on Bovery. Why?


                                     JUSTINE
                         What time did Bubba bring you home?
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         We knocked off early 'bout four. Bubba 
                         had a date with a stewardess, why?
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh. I can't believe she's dead. I wasn't 
                         a very good friend to her.
 

                                     PHIL
                         Don't say that, Teeny. 'Course you were. 
                         'Course you were.

                         Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack 
                         Fields, your store manager. Before we 
                         open today, I just want to share some 
                         terrible and shocking news. One of our 
                         best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday. 
                         Gwen was a real class act. She had a 
                         good attitude, she had ideas. We're 
                         all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all 
                         need to collect you thoughts and remember 
                         Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll 
                         be excused from work and we'll just 
                         have to do without you. Gwen, this one's 
                         for you.
 

               (music comes over PA)


               


                                     JUSTINE
                         Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's 
                         Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love. 
                         He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin' 
                         around around in the sticks and the 
                         dirt and bein' one with nature. He was 
                         so fixed on the idea thateven when the 
                         clouds started rollin' in, and the sky 
                         was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'. 
                         All my thoughts turned to death. I thought 
                         of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought 
                         of how nice a person she was, so full 
                         of life and good will. If there was 
                         a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin' 
                         makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice. 
                         I thought if I died today, what would 
                         happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish 
                         girl. An adultress. A liar.
 

               


               (Justine and Holden are running towards the car and get in)
 
               

               


               (Next scene they're in the car; back seats, kissing)


                                     JUSTINE
                         What are we doin'?


                                     HOLDEN
                         Makin' one out of two.


                                     JUSTINE
                         (sighs) I haven't thought this through.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Justine, will you leave him?


                                     JUSTINE
                         And go where?


                                     HOLDEN
                         Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll 
                         think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin' 
                         I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend, 
                         a pretty one, who knows me and likes 
                         me. And they'll be so happy, they'll 
                         give me money to write my novel.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         But where will we GO?


                                     HOLDEN
                         We'll be like... Catcher in the Rye. 
                         Only by me. I'll be immortal and then 
                         like JD Salinger I'll just vanish.

                         Hey, Teeny. We've been up to no good. 
                         We got the day off on account of the 
                         rain.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I thought you might.

                         So I heard about your friend bein' dead, 
                         and all. I'm sorry.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah. She was real healthy too.


                                     BUBBA
                         Well, at least you were with her when 
                         she went. (intense voice and look) Ain't 
                         that right? You were... with her, when 
                         she went?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah.

                         Fine.

                         Real shocker. I decided to move Cheryl 
                         over to cosmetics. She got a little 
                         too creative on the P.A. Maybe she'll 
                         watch her P's and Q's over here. If 
                         not she's out on her but. Now you listen 
                         to Justine, sister.

                         You want me to help you get stuff out 
                         of storage?

                         Well, are you gonna give me a ride home? 
                         My ankle's actin' up.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I gotta get home. Maybe Cheryl can.

                         Forget it.

                         Just be patient, Holden!

                         Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're 
                         gonna make you pretty. Now how do you 
                         like your hair?

                         Wait, you gonna do my hair?


                                     CHERYL
                         No, I just need to know if that's your 
                         usual way of wearing it all big and 
                         high. If it is then I'll just put more 
                         makeup on your chin to off-set. Now, 
                         you're gonna want to take a whole bottle 
                         of this home wtih you. It's got quite 
                         alot of ingredients in it so you're 
                         getting a good deal. It's got Ginco 
                         extract in it, do you know what that 
                         is?

                                     CHERYL
                         It's extract of the Ginco and it makes 
                         your skin real slick so that any liquid 
                         will roll right off, be it water or 
                         lemon juice or urine. I'll put that 
                         in a bag for you.

                         important I need to tend to.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I thought you said we'd go today.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Well, something came up.


                                     HOLDEN
                         What came up?


                                     JUSTINE
                         Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody's 
                         found out about us.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I'm starting to wonder if you even want 
                         to go. I'm startin' to think you don't 
                         get me.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Well, maybe I don't get you.


                                     HOLDEN
                         You do, you do get me you just don't 
                         want to me 'cause I'm too intensified 
                         for you! Justine, who cares, who cares 
                         if someone finds out. We don't have 
                         to live like this, Justine. I know what 
                         it's like to go home every night and 
                         feel like you're hidin' out. We can 
                         leave all this behind...
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         That's easy for you to say, Holden, 
                         you are not married.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         You just, you just gonna give up?! You 
                         gonna go crawlin' back?!
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Holden, you are gonna get us caught!
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         You're so fucking afraid it makes me 
                         sick. Don't give up on us.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I won't.


               


               (Justine goes out of the backdoor of Retail Rodeo, takes a few 
               deep breaths, trying not to freak out)
 

               


                                     JUSTINE
                         I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Okay. Good luck on your important thing.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Thanks.


               


               (Justine arrives at Bubba's. He opens the door and his dog, Bitz, 
               is barking.)
 

                                     BUBBA
                         Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner! 
                         Back in your corner! Back in your corner, 
                         Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'. 
                         Sit. (Yells at dog again) I'm in shock.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Why?


                                     BUBBA
                         You know why.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Bubba sat like that for what seemed 
                         like ten years before he began to speak. 
                         Finally, when he opened his mouth, he 
                         talked a blue streak about the ruin 
                         that was his life. He talked about how 
                         he loved Phil, and how he loved me. 
                         And how he always wanted a girlfriend 
                         just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, 
                         to this imaginary girl like me, that 
                         he never found. Then he wen on about 
                         givin' up your dreams and how it's all 
                         a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given 
                         up on his dream to be like Phil, and 
                         accepted his fate as Bubba, always and 
                         forever. Then, last week, a door that 
                         remained shut swung wide open. Bubba 
                         thought this no chance coincidence, 
                         a cosmic force was at work. The sounds 
                         of me makin' love to a man that wasn't 
                         Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear 
                         from the creator himself. What it meant, 
                         or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. 
                         All he knew was that he hated me for 
                         poisoning the well of idealism that 
                         he had drunk from for so long. I was 
                         no longer Bubba's image of perfection. 
                         To him I was just a liar, and a whore, 
                         and that sickened him. But on the other 
                         hand he loved me for opening his eyes 
                         and releasing him from the bitter chains 
                         of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil 
                         was no superman, just a cuckhold, and 
                         a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba 
                         felt that there was just one thing left 
                         for us to do. Something that would solve 
                         both our problems and end this whole 
                         tragic cycle.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.
 
                         

                                     BUBBA
                         But don't you see? This is my chance, 
                         for liberation.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         But, one person's liberation is another 
                         person's, well, badness. There's just 
                         no way.
 

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm gonna have to tell Phil then.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Why?


                                     BUBBA
                         He's my best friend. I can't keep him 
                         in the dark about somethin' this big. 
                         He's a cuckhold.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You wanna cuckhold him yourself!


                                     BUBBA
                         Well that's different. That isn't about 
                         him. That's about my salvation. Look, 
                         you've got your choice to make. Either 
                         destroy your marriage, and break your 
                         husband's heart. Or have sex with me 
                         right now.
 

               


               (Bubba is yelling at the dog again, and saying Justine's name)
 
               

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh god! There was someone in the window! 
                         Did you not see?
 

                                     BUBBA
                         You're paranoid.


                                     JUSTINE
                         I gotta go.


                                     BUBBA
                         Phil is never gonna find out about any 
                         of this. Don't fret. (the dog is still 
                         barking)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Get this damn dog away from me!


               


                                     BUBBA
                         You're lookin' at a free man, Justine. 
                         A free man.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Great. Good for you.


                                     BUBBA
                         Thank you. (Yelling at dog again.)
 
                         

               


               (TV sounds as Phil comes out of the bathroom, still brushing 
               his teeth)
 

                                     PHIL
                         I'm nervous.


                                     JUSTINE
                         You're nervous? Why?


                                     PHIL
                         'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow 
                         and jism into a cup, that's why. What 
                         if I can't do it?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You can do it.


                                     PHIL
                         You know, If you said you'd help me 
                         I'd feel alot less nervous. It's gonna 
                         be on your lunch hour anyway.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Okay.


                                     PHIL
                         You didn't even say nothing about the 
                         TV bein' fixed.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh. Is it? Thanks.


                                     PHIL
                         You're welcome.


               


                                     JACK
                         Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you 
                         talked to Holden lately? He didn't show 
                         up for work today, I wanna know what 
                         gives. I know you two are friends.
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         We're not friends.


                                     JACK
                         You eat lunch together every day.


                                     JUSTINE
                         No, we don't.


                                     JACK
                         Well, if you see him, tell him Jack 
                         Fields is lookin' for him.
 

               


               (Justine gets in the car and is shocked when she sees Holden 
               in the car, more depressed than ever.)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Oh my god. What are you doin'?


                                     HOLDEN
                         You're a hooker, you hooker.


                                     JUSTINE
                         I saw you. You followed me.


                                     HOLDEN
                         So, how many guys you gettin' with? 
                         You gettin' with every guy in the state?
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         No, Holden, this is all because of you. 
                         He had me over a barrel. If I didn't 
                         sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil 
                         about us!
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         I'm so alone!


                                     JUSTINE
                         You've gotta get a hold of yourself! 
                         Are you drunk?
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, I'm drunk! And I'll be drunk every 
                         day until the day I die! What do you 
                         care?! You jump on any pecker that's 
                         put in front of you!
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's not what you think.


                                     HOLDEN
                         I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.

                         after work.

                         I gotta help Phil with his sperm.

                         one man but not with a whole bunch of

                         I stack up against Phil? You know, how 
                         do I stack up where it counts?

                         You're breakin' out 'cause you put so 
                         much makeup on your face.

                         You know, sometimes, I think to myself, 
                         at least it can't get any worse. But 
                         it can. I can worse. As long as you 
                         can say you've hit rock bottom you can.

                         A blind man can go deaf. A widow can 
                         lose her children. Babies starve and 
                         they never get food. They never get 
                         any food. They just come into the world 
                         and they die.

                         Calm down, Holden!


                                     HOLDEN
                         I can't calm down! I'd be easy if I 
                         was a hooker like you. I could calm 
                         down all over town.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.


                                     HOLDEN
                         I know you're not. I'm in agony.

                         Why?

                         What do you mean 'why'? I thought you 
                         hated your life.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You 
                         are really depressed.

                         I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his 
                         sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal 
                         the money whatever it takes. You just, 
                         just whatever you want as long as it's 
                         you and me. Please don't forsake me 
                         Justine.

                         Oh... I, I promise. (car is parked somewhere; 
                         Justine and Holden are sitting on the 
                         car, Holden's smoking)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         I realized then that Holden was at best 
                         a child, and at worst a demon. If I 
                         was ever gonna go straight I'd have 
                         to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back 
                         on the road to redemption, you have 
                         to make a few pit stops.

                         day to day. We gotta chart a course 
                         and we just gotaa stick....

                         But, they're dirty. (hesitating, he 
                         eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're 
                         sweet. If I could only get my hands 
                         on some money, someone could just tell 
                         me the answer. I gotta do. But If I 
                         ever do, I end up thinking about it 
                         instead. I gotta do. But do what? (Justine 
                         pushes the blackberry he's about to 
                         eat away from his mouth) What...? What 
                         was that for?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         They looked dirty. I, I think I saw 
                         a bug in them or something.

                         I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried 
                         about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently, 
                         and now, well, I think he's mentally 
                         ill. He has this idea in his head that 
                         we've had some sort of affair. Which 
                         is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's 
                         been sayin' all sorts of strange things, 
                         and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And, 
                         and I just think he would be better 
                         off in a place where people, professionals, 
                         could take care of him. Otherwise, he's 
                         just gonna get himself in trouble.

                         And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate 
                         at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna 
                         bring Bubba. You can bring some of your 
                         friends from work. Or Bible study guy. 
                         Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead.

                         The test could be wrong, Phil. It's 
                         a little early to be havin' a party.
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't 
                         seem too excited.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of 
                         worries come with havin' a baby...
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         Don't think negative. Think positive. 
                         We could have ourselves a tiny Phil. 
                         Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have 
                         a tiny weeny Teeny.

                         Do you think anything's gonna change 
                         havin' a baby?

                         change.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's 
                         really gonna change?

               (Holden and his parents sit on the couch and watch TV when the 
               phone rings. Holden gets it.)
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         (picks up the phone) Hello?

                         Hi, this is Dr. Williams returning the 
                         call of Jean Worther. I'm calling from 
                         the Holland County psychiatric hospital. 
                         (Holden hangs up)

                         It was a wrong number.


               


               (Holden goes into his room with a crazy smile on his face. He 
               starts to laugh. When he hears the phone ring again, he stops 
               smiling and starts to look like he's thinking of something.)

                         Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars 
                         from the safe. They blew the thing open 
                         with a gun.

                         Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his

                         They can't find him though. They say 
                         he robbed his folks too. You in on it?

                         Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars 
                         from the safe last night. Did you have 
                         anything to do with it?

                         I've seen you in the store room with 
                         him Justine. On many the occasion. I

                         Corny's got a camera in that storage 
                         room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's 
                         been watchin' us the whole time.
 

                                     HOLDEN

                         over twenty thousand dollars! I got 
                         a gun, what else?!

                         gonna crash. (takes a right turn and 
                         stops the car) I'm pregnant, Holden.

                         It's my baby.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Not necessarily.


                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, it is. You know it is.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby 
                         on the run.
 

                                     HOLDEN
                         Yes, you can. I mean, you can't raise 
                         a baby here. You know that. Justine. 
                         You hate your husband. You hate your 
                         job. You love me, so let's go.

                         I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my 
                         things and I'd have to get more money.
 
                         

                                     HOLDEN
                         Well, then tomorrow. I'll go to the 
                         motel and wait for you. Just be there 
                         by noon.

                                     HOLDEN
                         Justine, what have you got to lose?

                         Okay.

                         I love you, Justine. This is all gonna 
                         work out. I know it. I almost forgot.

                         (picks up the phone) Hello. Yeah. Well, 
                         that's not right. What's that supposed 
                         to mean? Hey look. No. You don't know 
                         shit okay. Justine's pregnant. You got 
                         that? Well, look you better check your 
                         records again, pal, then call me! (hangs 
                         up) Some doctor says my sperm's no good. 
                         Does that mean Justine's not pregnant?

                         No. That just means they got it wrong, 
                         is all. They don't know everything.

                         They just got it wrong, so...

                                     PHIL
                         Looks like that wind's pickin' up again.
 
                         

               


               (Justine is packing her things, she seems to be in a hurry. She 
               drives down the street with her car and stops because of the 
               red lights.)

                         How it all came down to this, only the 
                         devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the 
                         corner on my left, the motel was down 
                         the road to my right. I closed my eyes 
                         and tried to peer into the future. On 
                         my left I saw days upon days of lipstick 
                         and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and 
                         quiet whisperings. and burning secrets 
                         that won't ever die away. And on my 
                         right, what could I picture? The blue 
                         sky, the desert earth streching out 
                         into the eerie infinity. A beautiful, 
                         never ending nothing.

                         I thought we were robbed. Why aren't

                         Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?

                         Attention Retail Rodeo employees this 
                         is JAck Fields, your store manager. 
                         As most of you all know by now, We lost 
                         another employee yesterday. Holden was 
                         a thief and a disturbed young man, and 
                         what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps 
                         we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, 
                         like don't steal and don't be disturbed. 
                         The important is to move on. Like dozens 
                         of those who quit. This one's for you 
                         Holden.

                         I thought we were gonna get a day off 
                         and go to the movies....
 

               


                                     JUSTINE
                         What?


                                     BUBBA
                         I was just at your house and the mail 
                         came. Phil was opening letters, and 
                         he opened this bill from the credit 
                         card company. And F&$%. Please don't 
                         tell him about us, Justine. Please. 
                         Please. I love Phil. I love him more 
                         than myself. Please have mercy on me.

                         I don't know why.


                                     PHIL
                         Don't you love me? Don't you love me 
                         at all?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         You're the only man alive that I love.
 
                         

                                     PHIL
                         Oh god. Please don't tell me it's not 
                         my baby.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's your baby.


                                     PHIL
                         Are you sure?


                                     JUSTINE
                         It is. I swear. I swear to God.


                                     PHIL
                         Who is he?


                                     JUSTINE
                         It doesn't matter.


                                     PHIL
                         Yes, it does. Was it some guy from work?
 
                         

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes.


                                     PHIL
                         Yeah, I know who it was. It was that 
                         Bible guy, wasn't it? The Nazarine. 
                         That's why you were actin' so spooked.

                                     PHIL
                         You're gettin' all swollen. I'm sorry

                                     PHIL
                         I need to get stoned.

                                     PHIL
                         I just gotta escape, you know. You ever 
                         feel like that? Like you gotta escape?
 
                         

               


                                     JUSTINE
                         What are those?


                                     CHERYL
                         Fake eyelashes. Extra long.


                                     JUSTINE
                         Just do it normal for once?


                                     CHERYL
                         You want me to make the other cheek 
                         purple to even it out?
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         No.


                                     CHERYL
                         D'you hear about Corny? He was goin' 
                         home after Bible study last night and 
                         two beefy guys with painted faces pulled 
                         up in a truck and jumped him.
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         That's terrible.


               (shot of Justine in the bathroom of Retail Rodeo. She's sitting 
               on one of the toilets, she's wearing fake eyelashes and just 
               looks trashy.)
 

                                     JUSTINE
                         That day I read the story Holden wrote 
                         for me. It was kinda different from 
                         the other one, but kinda the same. It 
                         was about a woman who was put upon. 
                         Whose job was a prison, and whose life 
                         had lost all meaning. Other people don't 
                         get her, especially her husband. One 
                         day she meets a boy who is also put 
                         upon, and they fall in love. After spending 
                         their whole lives not getting got, with 
                         one look they get eachother completely. 
                         In the end, the boy and the girl run 
                         away together in the wilderness, never 
                         to be heard from again.
GOOD WILL HUNTING

 
                                   "GOOD WILL HUNTING"

                                            by

                                 Matt Damon & Ben Affleck

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE -- DAY

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING

               The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is 
               ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across 
               several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last 
               nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh my God, I got the most fucked up 
                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

               As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a 
               table near the back of the bar.

                                     ALL
                         Oh Jesus. Here we go.

               The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest 
               of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. 
               Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a 
               softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22, 
               heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle 
               with.

               Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other 
               guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror 
               stories with eager disgust.

               All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a 
               rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are 
               its product.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You guys know my cousin Mikey 
                         Sullivan?

                                     ALL
                         Yeah.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well you know how he loves animals 
                         right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin' 
                         home...
                              (laughs)

                                     ALL
                         What? Come on!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (trying not to laugh)
                         I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, 
                         the fuckin guy loves animals, and 
                         this is the last person you'd want 
                         this to happen to.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what the fuck happened?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Okay. He's driving along and this 
                         fuckin' cat jumps in front of his 
                         car, and so he hits this cat--

               Chuckie is really laughing now.

                                     MORGAN
                         --That isn't funny--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!"
                         And he looks in his rearview and 
                         sees this cat -- I'm sorry--

                                     BILLY
                         Fuckin' Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So he sees this cat tryin to make it 
                         across the street and it's not lookin' 
                         so good.

                                     WILL
                         It's walkin' pretty slow at this 
                         point.

                                     MORGAN
                         You guys are fuckin' sick.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So Mikey's like "Fuck, I gotta put 
                         this thing out of its misery"--So he 
                         gets a hammer--

                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
                         OH!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         out of his tool box, and starts 
                         chasin' the cat and starts whackin' 
                         it with the hammer. You know, tryin' 
                         to put the thing out of its misery.

                                     MORGAN
                         Jesus.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And all the time he's apologizin' to 
                         the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, 
                         "I'm sorry." BANG!

                                     BILLY
                         Like it can understand.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And this Samoan guy comes runnin' 
                         out of his house and he's like "What 
                         the fuck are you doing to my cat?!" 
                         Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I 
                         hit your cat with my truck, and I'm 
                         just trying to put it out of it's 
                         misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies. 
                         So Mikey's like "Why don't you come 
                         look at the front of the truck."
                         'Cause the other guy's all fuckin 
                         flipped out about--

                                     WILL
                         Watching his cat get brained.

               Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, so he's like "Check the front 
                         of my truck, I can prove I hit it 
                         'cause there's probably some blood 
                         or something"--

                                     WILL
                         --or a tail--

                                     MORGAN
                         WILL!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And so they go around to the front 
                         of his truck... and there's another 
                         cat on the grille.

                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
                         No! Ugh!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Is that unbelievable? He brained an 
                         innocent cat!

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               The opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city 
               and the real people who live and work there, going about 
               their daily lives.

               We see a panoramic view of South Boston.

               Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare. A bed, a 
               small night table and an empty basket adorn the room. A stack 
               of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed. He is flipping 
               through a book at about a page a second.

               Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house. His Cadillac 
               idles by the curb. Will comes out and they get in the car.

               We travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown.

               Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great 
               cementdomed buildings that make up the M.I.T. campus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- DAY

               The classroom is packed with graduate students and TOM.

               PROFESSOR LAMBEAU (52) is at the lectern. The chalkboard 
               behind him is covered with theorems.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please finish McKinley by next month.

               Many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real 
               analysis. It won't hurt to brush up. I am also putting an 
               advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard--

               Everyone groans.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm hoping that one of you might 
                         prove it by the end of the semester. 
                         The first person to do so will not 
                         only be in my good graces, but go on 
                         to fame and fortune by having their 
                         accomplishment recorded and their 
                         name printed in the auspicious "M.I.T. 
                         Tech."

               Prof. Lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled "M.I.T.  
               Tech." Everyone laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Former winners include Nobel 
                         Laureates, world renowned astro-
                         physicists, Field's Medal winners 
                         and lowly M.I.T.  professors.

               More laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. That is all.

               A smattering of applause. Students pack their bags.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNLAND  LATER

               The place is a monster indoor funpark. Will, Chuckie, Morgan, 
               and Billy are in adjoining batting cages. Will has disabled 
               the pitching machine in his and pitches to Chuckie. The boys 
               have been drinking. Will throws one to Chuckie, high and 
               tight.

               Several empty beer cans sit by the cage.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Will!

               Another pitch, inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're gonna get charged!

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm afraid of you, you big 
                         fuck? You're crowdin' the plate.

               Will guns another one, way inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Stop brushin' me back!

                                     WILL
                         Stop crowdin the plate!

               Chuckie laughs and steps back.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. 
                         We should go there sometime.

                                     WILL
                         What are we gonna do up there?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know, we'll fuck up some 
                         smart kids.
                              (stepping back in)
                         You'd prob'ly fit right in.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

               Will fires a pitch at Chuckie's head. Chuckie dives to avoid 
               being hit. He gets up and whips his batting helmet at Will.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ROOFTOP -- EARLY AFTERNOON

               SEAN McGUIRE (52) sits, FORMALLY DRESSED, on the roof of his 
               apartment building in a beat-up lawn chair. Well-built and 
               fairly muscular, he stares blankly out over the city.

               On his lap rests an open invitation that reads "M.I.T. CLASS 
               OF '67 REUNION."

               While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is 
               a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times. This 
               is a man who fought his way through life. On his lonely stare 
               we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS LAWN -- DAY

               A thirty year REUNION PARTY has taken over the lawn. A well 
               dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that 
               reads "WELCOME BACK CLASS OF '72." We find Professor Lambeau 
               standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd. He 
               is interrupted by an approaching STUDENT.

                                     STUDENT
                         Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes.

                                     STUDENT
                         I'm in your applied theories class.
                         We're all down at the Math and Science 
                         building.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's Saturday.

                                     STUDENT
                         I know. We just couldn't wait 'till 
                         Monday to find out.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Find out what?

                                     STUDENT
                         Who proved the theorem.

               EXT. TOM FOLEY PARK, S. BOSTON -- AFTERNOON

               In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys, 
               drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The 
               boys have been here a while and it shows.

               Billy sees something that catches his interest.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's that? She's got a nice ass.

               Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a 
               beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA)

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that is a nice ass.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You could put a pool in that backyard.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's she talking to?

                                     MORGAN
                         That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat 
                         the shit outta' me in Kindergarten.

                                     BILLY
                         He's a pretty big kid.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, he's the same size now as he 
                         was in Kindergarten.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck this, let's get something to 
                         eat...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What Morgan, you're not gonna go 
                         talk to her?

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck her.

               The boys get up and walk down the bleachers.

                                     WILL
                         I could go for a Whopper.

                                     MORGAN
                              (nonchalant)
                         Let's hit "Kelly's."

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's 
                         Roast Beef" just cause you like the 
                         take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes 
                         out of our way.

                                     MORGAN
                         What else we gonna do we can't spare 
                         fifteen minutes?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell 
                         you why we're not going to "Kelly's." 
                         It's because the take-out bitch is a 
                         fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like 
                         her but she's dumb as a post and she 
                         has never got our order right, never 
                         once.

                                     MORGAN
                         She's not stupid.

                                     WILL
                         She's sharp as a marble.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         We're not goin'.
                              (beat)
                         I don't even like "Kelly's."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the 
               hallway, carrying some papers. A group of students have 
               gathered by the chalkboard. They part like the red sea as he 
               approaches the board. Using the papers in hand, he checks 
               the proof.

               Satisfied, he turns to the class.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct? Who did this?

               Dead silence. Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Nemesh?

               Nemesh shakes his head in awe.

                                     NEMESH
                         No way.

               Lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, whoever You are, I'm sure you'll 
                         find this one challenging enough to 
                         merit coming forward with your 
                         identity.  That is, if you can do 
                         it.

               INT. CHUCKIE'S CAR, DRIVING IN SOUTH BOSTON -- CONTINUOUS

               The street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway. They 
               move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down. Chuckie 
               sorts through a large "KELLY'S ROAST BEEF" BAG as he drives.

                                     MORGAN
                         Double Burger.

               Will holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the 
               bag.

                                     MORGAN
                              (same tone)
                         Double Burger.

               Chuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries.

                                     MORGAN
                         I, I had a Kelly's Double Burger.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Would you shut the fuck up! I know 
                         what you ordered, I was there!

                                     MORGAN
                         So why don't you give me my sandwich?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do you mean "your sandwich?" I 
                         bought it.

                                     MORGAN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Yah, all right...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How much money you got?

                                     MORGAN
                         I told you, I just got change.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well give me your fuckin' change and 
                         we'll put your fuckin' sandwich on 
                         layaway.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I think you should establish a good 
                         line of credit.

               Laughter, Chuckie goes back searching through the bag.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh motherfucker...

                                     WILL
                         She didn't do it again did she?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Jesus Christ. Not even close.

                                     MORGAN
                         Did she get my Double Burger?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!!
                         IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!

               Chuckie whips a FISH SANDWICH back to Morgan, then to Billy.

                                     WILL
                         Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone 
                         even order a Flyin' Fish?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, and we got four of 'em.

                                     BILLY
                         You gotta' be kiddin' me. Why do we 
                         even go to her?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cause fuckin' Morgan's got a crush 
                         on her, we always go there and when 
                         we get to the window he never says a 
                         fuckin' word to her, he never even 
                         gets out of the car, and she never 
                         gets our order right cause she's the 
                         goddamn MISSING LINK!

                                     WILL
                         Well, she out did herself today...

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't got a crush on her.

               Push in on Will who sees something O.S.

               Will's P.O.V. reveals BOBBY CHAMPA and his friends walking 
               down the street. One of them casually lobs a bottle into a 
               wire garbage can. It SHATTERS and some of the glass hits a 
               FEMALE PASSERBY who, although unhurt, is upset.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do we got?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know yet.

               Will's P.O.V.: The woman says something to Bobby. He says 
               something back. By the look on her face, it was something 
               unpleasant.

                                     MORGAN
                         Come on, Will...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut up.

                                     MORGAN
                         No, why didn't you fight him at the 
                         park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' 
                         now, I'm eatin' my snack.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         So don't go.

               Will is out of the door, jogging toward Bobby Champa. Billy 
               gets out, following Will with a look of casual indifference.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, Let's go.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.

               Leaving the car, Chuckie opens his door to follow.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (spins in his seat)
                         You're goin'. And if you're not out 
                         there in two fuckin' seconds, when 
                         I'm done with them you're next!

               And with that, Chuckie is out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK --CONTINUOUS

               Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA, calling out from 
               across the street,

                                     WILL
                              (smiling, good 
                              naturedly)
                         Hey, Bobby Champa! I went to 
                         Kindergarten with you right? Sister 
                         Margaret's class...

               Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure 
               of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby 
               might remember him, Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which 
               begins the

               FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S "LET'S GET IT ON."

               Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the 
               hapless Champa out cold.

               As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL. 
               Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two 
               exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.

               Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying 
               to avoid being overrun.

               When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he 
               HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.

               Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a 
               shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he 
               was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.

               Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will 
               can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's 
               boys from the hood of a car.

               Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a 
               fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.

               The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown 
               wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone 
               throws a bottle.

               In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's 
               friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, 
               standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING 
               him.

               ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT

               Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking 
               them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious 
               Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away.

               The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only 
               witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him.

               EXT. SIDEWALK (FULL SPEED) -- CONTINUOUS

               A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, thanks for comin' out.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, you're all invited over to 
                         Morgan's house for a complementary 
                         fish sandwich.

               The Police slam Will into the hood of a car.

                                     WILL
                              (to Police)
                         Hey, I know it's not a French cruller, 
                         but it's free.

               The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood, 
               another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car. 
               The look of rage returns to Will's eye.

                                     WILL
                         Get the fuck off me!

               Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE 
               KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a 
               fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though 
               he struggles -- takes a beating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SEAN'S ROOF -- NIGHT

               Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is 
               now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side. 
               He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out 
               of a doorway on the roof.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean?

               Sean doesn't answer.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean? You okay?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

               A beat.

                                     LANDLADY
                         It's getting cold.

               After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean 
               doesn't move.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               EXT. CHARLES RIVER, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE -- NEXT MORNING

               Will emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him 
               in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee. 
               He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         When's the arraignment?

                                     WILL
                         Next week.

               Chuckie pulls away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               Students walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other, 
               students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM.

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

               The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. Tom 
               takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited 
               environment with mock pomposity and good humor.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is it my imagination, or has my class 
                         grown considerably?

               Laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I look around and see young people 
                         who are my students, young people 
                         who are not my students as well as 
                         some of my colleagues. And by no 
                         stretch of my imagination do I think 
                         you've all come to hear me lecture.

               More laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         But rather to ascertain the identity 
                         of who our esteemed "The Tech" has 
                         come to call "The Mystery Math 
                         Magician."

               He holds up the M.I.T. Tech featuring a silhouetted figure, 
               emblazoned with a large, white question mark. The headline 
               reads "Mystery Math Magician strikes again."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Whoever you are, you've solved four 
                         of the most difficult theorems I've 
                         ever given a class. So without further 
                         ado, come forward silent rogue, and 
                         receive thy prize.

               The class waits in breathless anticipation. A STUDENT shifts 
               his weight in his chair, making a noise.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my 
                         spectators, but it appears there 
                         will be no unmasking here today. I'm 
                         going to have to ask those of you 
                         not enrolled in the class to make 
                         your escape now or, for the next 
                         three hours be subjected to the 
                         mundities of eigenvectors.

               People start to gather their things and go. Lambeau picks up 
               a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         However, my colleagues and I have 
                         conferred. There is a problem on the 
                         board, right now, that took us two 
                         years to prove. So let this be said; 
                         the gauntlet has been thrown down. 
                         But the faculty have answered the 
                         challenge and answered with vigor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Lambeau comes out of his office with Tom and locks the door. 
               As he turns to walk down the hallway, he stops. A faint 
               TICKING SOUND can be heard. He turns and walks down the hall.

               Lambeau and Tom come around a corner. His P.O.V. reveals a 
               figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the 
               chalkboard. There is a mop and a bucket beside him. As Lambeau 
               draws closer, reveal that the figure is Will, in his janitor's 
               uniform. There is a look of intense concentration in his 
               eyes.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me!

               Will looks up, immediately starts to shuffle off.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What're you doing?

                                     WILL
                              (walking away)
                         I'm sorry.

               Lambeau follows Will down the hall.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's your name?
                              (beat)
                         Don't you walk away from me. This is 
                         people's work, you can't graffiti 
                         here.

                                     WILL
                         Hey fuck you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (flustered)
                         Well... I'll be speaking to your 
                         supervisor.

               Will walks out. Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning 
               the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused. He stops, 
               scans the board again. Amazement registers on his face.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         My God.

               Down the hall, we hear the DOOR CLOSE. He turns to look for 
               Will, who is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW PUB, CAMBRIDGE -- THAT NIGHT

               A crowded Harvard Bar. Will and our gang walk by a line of 
               several Harvard students, waiting to be carded.

                                     MORGAN
                         What happened?
                              (beat)
                         You got fired, huh?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

                                     MORGAN
                              (starts laughing)
                         How fuckin' retarded do you have to 
                         be to get shit-canned from that job? 
                         How hard is it to push a fuckin' 
                         broom?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You got fired from pushing a broom, 
                         you little bitch.

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that was different. Management 
                         was restructurin'--

                                     BILLY
                         Yah, restructurin' the amount of 
                         retards they had workin' for them.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, you fat fuck.

                                     BILLY
                         Least I work for a livin'.
                              (to Will)
                         Why'd you get fired?

                                     WILL
                         Management was restructurin'.

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My uncle can probably get you on my 
                         demo team.

                                     MORGAN
                         What the fuck? I just asked you for 
                         a job yesterday!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I told you "no" yesterday!

               After two students flash their ID's to the doorman (CASEY) 
               our boys file past him.

                                     ALL
                              (one after another)
                         What's up Case.

               With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through. A 
               fifth kid, a HARVARD STUDENT, tries to follow. He is stopped 
               by Casey's massive, outstretched arm:

                                     CASEY
                         ID?

               INT. BOW AND ARROW -- CONTINUOUS

               Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher, 
               all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, this is a Harvard bar, huh? I 
                         thought there'd be equations and 
                         shit on the wall.

               INT. BACK SECTION, BOW AND ARROW -- MOMENTS LATER

               Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have 
               made themselves comfortable. He [Chuckie] spots two ATTRACTIVE 
               YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar.

               Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair. 
               He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston 
               accent.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, how's it goin'?

                                     LYDIA
                         Fine.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, you ladies ah, go to school here?

                                     LYDIA
                         Yes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, cause I think I had a class 
                         with you.

               At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan 
               Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate 
               themselves within listening distance. A rather large student 
               in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie. 
               He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering 
               over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's 
               attention.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What class?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Ah, history I think.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, it's not a bad school...

               At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in.

                                     CLARK
                         What class did you say that was?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         History.

                                     CLARK
                         How'd you like that course?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Good, it was all right.

                                     CLARK
                         History? Just "history?" It must 
                         have been a survey course then.

               Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy 
               exchange a look and move subtly closer.

                                     CLARK
                         Pretty broad. "History of the World?"

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, come on pal we're in classes 
                         all day. That's one thing about 
                         Harvard never seizes to amaze me, 
                         everybody's talkin' about school all 
                         the time.

                                     CLARK
                         Hey, I'm the last guy to want to 
                         talk about school at the bar. But as 
                         long as you're here I want to "seize" 
                         the opportunity to ask you a question.

               Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan 
               see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..."

                                     CLARK
                         Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your 
                         history class.

               Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not.

               When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and 
               rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         To tell you the truth, I wasn't there 
                         much. The class was rather elementary.

                                     CLARK
                         Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that 
                         it was. I remember the class, it was 
                         just between recess and lunch.

               Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All right, are we gonna have a 
                         problem?

                                     CLARK
                         There's no problem. I was just hoping 
                         you could give me some insight into 
                         the evolution of the market economy 
                         in the early colonies. My contention 
                         is that prior to the Revolutionary 
                         War the economic modalities especially 
                         of the southern colonies could most 
                         aptly be characterized as agrarian 
                         precapitalist and...

               Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and 
               is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.

                                     WILL
                         Of course that's your contention. 
                         You're a first year grad student. 
                         You just finished some Marxian 
                         historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, 
                         and so naturally that's what you 
                         believe until next month when you 
                         get to James Lemon and get convinced 
                         that Virginia and Pennsylvania were 
                         strongly entrepreneurial and 
                         capitalist back in 1740. That'll 
                         last until sometime in your second 
                         year, then you'll be in here 
                         regurgitating Gordon Wood about the 
                         Pre-revolutionary utopia and the 
                         capital-forming effects of military 
                         mobilization.

                                     CLARK
                              (taken aback)
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, 
                         because Wood drastically 
                         underestimates the impact of--

                                     WILL
                         "Wood drastically underestimates the 
                         impact of social distinctions 
                         predicated upon wealth, especially 
                         inherited wealth..." You got that 
                         from "Work in Essex County," Page 
                         421, right? Do you have any thoughts 
                         of your own on the subject or were 
                         you just gonna plagiarize the whole 
                         book for me?

               Clark is stunned.

                                     WILL
                         Look, don't try to pass yourself off 
                         as some kind of an intellect at the 
                         expense of my friend just to impress 
                         these girls.

               Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.

                                     WILL
                         The sad thing is, in about 50 years 
                         you might start doin' some thinkin' 
                         on your own and by then you'll realize 
                         there are only two certainties in 
                         life.

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah? What're those?

                                     WILL
                         One, don't do that.  Two -- you 
                         dropped a hundred and fifty grand on 
                         an education you coulda' picked up 
                         for a dollar fifty in late charges 
                         at the Public Library.

               Will catches Skylar's eye.

                                     CLARK
                         But I will have a degree, and you'll 
                         be serving my kids fries at a drive 
                         through on our way to a skiing trip.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         Maybe. But at least I won't be a 
                         prick.
                              (beat)
                         And if you got a problem with that, 
                         I guess we can step outside and deal 
                         with it that way.

               While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] 
               decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.

                                     WILL
                         If you change your mind, I'll be 
                         over by the bar.

               He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a 
               look.

               Morgan turns to a nearby girl.

                                     MORGAN
                         My boy's wicked smart.

               INT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER

               Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement 
               as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the 
               players shoot miniature balls at a small basket. In the B.G.  
               occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry!" When he scores.

               Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You suck.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've been sitting over there for 
                         forty-five minutes waiting for you 
                         to come talk to me. But I'm just 
                         tired now and I have to go home and 
                         I wasn't going to keep sitting there 
                         waiting for you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Skylar. And by the way. That guy 
                         over there is a real dick and I just 
                         wanted you to know he didn't come 
                         with us.

                                     WILL
                         I kind of got that impression.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get 
                         up early and waste some more money 
                         on my overpriced education.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Here's my number.

               Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to 
               Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe we could go out for coffee 
                         sometime?

                                     WILL
                         Great, or maybe we could go somewhere 
                         and just eat a bunch of caramels.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         When you think about it, it's just 
                         as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, sounds good.

               She turns.

                                     WILL
                         Five minutes.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I was trying to be smooth.
                              (indicates clock)
                         But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna 
                         come over there and talk to you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, it's my life story. Five more 
                         minutes and I would have got to hear 
                         your best pick-up line.

                                     WILL
                         The caramel thing is my pick-up line.

               A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Glad I came over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW -- LATER

               Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about 
               their bar-ball exploits. Across the street is another bar 
               with a glass front. Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window 
               with some friends.

                                     MORGAN
                         There goes that fuckin' Barney right 
                         now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." 
                         We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

                                     WILL
                         Hold up.

               Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window 
               and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass. 
               He POUNDS THE GLASS to get Clark's attention.

                                     WILL
                         Hey!

               Clark turns toward Will.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?

               Clark doesn't get it.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?!

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah?

               Will SLAMS SKYLAR'S PHONE NUMBER against the glass.

                                     WILL
                         WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA 
                         LIKE THEM APPLES?!!

               Will's boys erupt into laughter. Angle on Clark, deflated.

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car, 
               laughing together.

               EXT. CHARLES STREET BRIDGE -- DAWN

               Shot of car crossing over the Charles St. Bridge, overtaking 
               a red-line train.

               EXT. CHARLESTON BACKROAD -- DAWN

               Traveling through narrow back roads in Charlestown, passing 
               the Bunker Hill monument.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY

               Lambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores 
               lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58) 
               sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page. 
               Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in 
               the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me. Is this the buildings and 
                         grounds office?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, can I help you?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm trying to find the name of a 
                         student who works here.

                                     TERRY
                         No students work for me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Could you just check, because the 
                         young man who works in my building--

                                     TERRY
                         Which one's your building?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Building two.

               Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, if something was stolen, I 
                         should know about it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no. Nothing like that. I just 
                         need his name.

                                     TERRY
                         I can't give you his name unless you 
                         have a complaint.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please, I'm a professor here and 
                         it's very important.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, he didn't show up for work 
                         today...

               Terry takes a beat. Holding all the cards.

                                     TERRY
                         Look, he got his job through his 
                         P.O. so you can call him.

               Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a 
               card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the 
               card which reads: "PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM."

               INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

               Will stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is 
               fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will 
               and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back.

                                     WILL
                         There is a lengthy legal precedent, 
                         Your Honor, going back to 1789, 
                         whereby a defendant may claim self-
                         defense against an agent of the 
                         government where the act is shown to 
                         be a defense against tyranny, a 
                         defense of liberty--

               The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who 
                         signed the complaint isn't in my 
                         courtroom. Why is that?

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         He's in the hospital with a broken 
                         knee, Your Honor. But I have 
                         depositions from the other officers.

                                     WILL
                         Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in 
                         his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit 
                         back in 1887, that "Every American 
                         citizen is by birth, a sworn officer 
                         of the state.  Every man is a 
                         policeman." As for the other officers, 
                         even William Congrave said; "he that 
                         first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft 
                         he that has stolen the treasure."

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Your Honor--

               Will cranks it up.

                                     WILL
                              (to Prosecutor)
                         I am afforded the right to speak in 
                         my own defense by our constitution, 
                         Sir.  The same document which 
                         guarantees my right to liberty. 
                         "Liberty," in case you've forgotten, 
                         is "the soul's right to breathe, and 
                         when it cannot take a long breath 
                         laws are girded too tight.  Without 
                         liberty, man is a syncope."
                              (beat, to Judge)
                         Ibid. Your Honor.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Man is a what?

                                     WILL
                         Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though 
                         he be wounded-- "Magna..."

               The Judge interrupts.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Son,
                              (a beat)
                         My turn.

               The Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                              (reading)
                         June, '93, assault, Sept. '93 
                         assault... Grand theft auto February 
                         '94.

               A beat, the Judge takes particular notice.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Where, apparently, you defended 
                         yourself and had the case thrown out 
                         by citing "free property rights of 
                         horse and carriage" from 1798...

               Lambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         March, '94 public drunkenness, public 
                         nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem. 
                         November '94, assault. Jan. '95 
                         impersonating a police officer, 
                         mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned--

               The Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         You're in my courtroom, now and I am 
                         aware of your priors.
                              (beat)
                         I'm also aware that you're an orphan. 
                         You've been through several foster 
                         homes. The state removed you from 
                         three because of serious physical 
                         abuse.

               The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Another Judge might care. You hit a 
                         cop, you go in.
                              (beat)
                         Motion to dismiss denied.

               The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Keep workin' on your arguments, son. 
                         A word of advice for trial; speak 
                         English.

               As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches 
               Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, your Honor.
                              (offers hand)
                         Gerald Lambeau.

               An awkward beat. Lambeau waits for some sign of recognition.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm a professor at M.I.T.

               The Judge offers only a blank look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Oh. Pleased to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Do you have a minute?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY JAIL, HOLDING AREA -- SAME

               A GUARD walks Will down a hallway toward a group of phones.

                                     GUARD

                              (beat)
                         One.

               The Guard gives Will a hard look for a beat. Then leaves.

                                     WILL
                         How many?

               Will picks up the phone, dials.

                                     WILL

                                     WILL
                         It's Will, the really funny good 
                         looking guy you met at the bar?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting 
                         anyone who fits that description.

                                     WILL
                         Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, 
                         obnoxious, toothless loser who got 
                         drunk and wouldn't leave you alone 
                         all night.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd 
                         call.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this 
                         week we could go to a cafe and have 
                         some caramels.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Sounds good, where are you now?

                         Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck do you want?

                         I've spoken with the judge and he's 
                         agreed to release you under my 
                         supervision.

                                     WILL
                              (suspicious)
                         Really?

                              (beat)
                         Yes. Under two conditions.

                                     WILL
                         What're those?

                         That you meet with me twice a week
                              (a beat)
                         and you meet with a therapist.

                                     WILL
                         If I agree to this, I walk right 
                         now?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         I'll do the work. I'm not going to 
                         meet with a therapist.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, 
                         Will.
                              (beat)
                         I've already spoken to one therapist, 
                         his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a 
                         friend of mine. He's also published 
                         four books and is widely considered 
                         to be one of the brightest men in

                         I'm sure it'll be better than spending 
                         the next six months in jail.

                         Suck my cock!

                                     BILLY
                         Oh, Morgan!

               Chuckie turns to Will, conspiratorially as they wait for the 
               fight to finish.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What'd you get? You get leniency?

                                     WILL
                         Probation, counselin', few days a 
                         week.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're fuckin' good.

               Will smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just submit, Morgan. He's got you in 
                         the Cobra Clutch.

                                     MORGAN
                              (to Chuckie)
                         Fuck your mother too!

               INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. A closer 
               look reveals he is reading a self-help PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. Will 
               is flipping through the book at about a page per second. He 
               shakes his head and smiles. Upon finishing the book, he throws 
               it in a nearby WASTEBASKET. Push in on the back of the book 
               where a SMILING PSYCHOLOGIST is pictured.

               INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

               Will sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office. Across 
               from Will sits the same PSYCHOLOGIST, HENRY LIPKIN (40), 
               from the book. They are in mid-session.

                                     WILL
                         That's why I love stock-car racin'. 
                         That Dale Ernhart's real good.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Now you know Will, and I know, what 
                         you need to be doing. You have a 
                         gift.

                                     WILL
                         I could work the pit maybe, but I 
                         could never drive like Dale Ernhart--

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You have a quality -- something you 
                         were born with, that you have no 
                         control over -- and you are, in a 
                         sense, hiding that by becoming a 
                         janitor. And I'm not saying that's 
                         wrong. I'm friends with the janitor 
                         that works in my building.  He's 
                         been to my house for dinner. As a 
                         matter of fact I did some free 
                         consultation for "Mike" -- that's 
                         not his real name. That's in my book.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had 
                         the same problems as "Chad" the 
                         stockbroker.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Yes. The pressures you feel, and 
                         again, I am neither labeling nor 
                         judging them, are keeping you from 
                         fulfilling your potential -- you're 
                         in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- 
                         the Shenanigan's, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. I know.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Will, your not getting off that easy.

                                     WILL
                         No, but, I mean you know... I do 
                         other things. That no one knows about.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Like what, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I go places, I interact.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What places?

                                     WILL
                         Certain, clubs.
                              (beat)
                         Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

               Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look.

                                     WILL
                         It's just that feeling when you can 
                         take your shirt off and really dance.
                              (beat)
                         When the music owns you. Do you 
                         understand?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I might understand that.

                                     WILL
                         Do you find it hard to hide the fact 
                         that you're gay?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, I read your book. I talked to 
                         you. It's just something I know to 
                         be true.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         That's very presumptuous.

                                     WILL
                         Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready 
                         to give me a jump.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                              (a little laugh)
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
                         but I'm married and I have two 
                         children.

                                     WILL
                         I'm sure you do. You probably got a 
                         real nice house, nice car -- your 
                         book's a best seller.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You're getting defensive, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Look, man. I don't care if you're 
                         putting from the rough. There are 
                         solid arguments that some of the 
                         greatest people in history were gay; 
                         Alexander the Great, Caesar, 
                         Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, 
                         Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny 
                         Terrio, not many straight men can 
                         dance like that.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Who is "Danny Terrio?"

                                     WILL
                         If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your 
                         shot. Take some pride in it. You go 
                         to church? So fuckin' what, God loves 
                         you.  I mean, Christ. A guy as well 
                         known as you? By the time you put 
                         your disguise on and skulk out of 
                         the house Sunday nights you probably 
                         look like "Inspector Clouseau."

               The Psychologist calmly packs his things.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Well, I can see this is pointless...

                                     WILL
                         You're getting defensive... Henry. 
                         And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at 
                         least.  Christ, set her free.

               The shrink gets up and walks out.

                                     WILL
                         Fuckin' hypocrite...

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of 
               Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Henry?

               The Psychologist keeps walking.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         No. You know what, Gerry? This is 
                         why I don't do pro-bono anymore. 
                         It's not worth it to me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What happened?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I don't have the time. I'm going on 
                         national television this week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Henry...

               He [Henry] is out the door. Lambeau looks to Tom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will is in Lambeau's office. Lambeau is at the board, working 
               on a diagram as Tom takes notes. Will seems disinterested.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This rectangle is subdivided into 
                         rectangles. One edge of an inner 
                         rectangle is an integer. Can you 
                         prove that one edge of the larger 
                         rectangle is an integer?

                                     WILL
                         Of course.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. How?

                                     WILL
                         It's an integer proof.

               Lambeau smiles.

                                     WILL
                         What? Hey, look buddy my time's almost 
                         up. You want me to sit here for an 
                         hour and write it out?

               Lambeau says nothing. Will gets up and goes to the board.

                                     WILL
                         Look, I'll give you the key steps to 
                         it but I'm not gonna do the whole 
                         thing.

               Lambeau keeps smiling.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be a monumental waste of 
                         time, wouldn't it, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I happen to know so.

               Lambeau rises and goes to the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're thinking too hard. What if I 
                         did this?

               He draws a vertical line through the diagram.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, what if I do this?

               He draws a horizontal line through the diagram. He hands 
               Will the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you ever played checkers?

               Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he starts 
               drawing lines through the diagram, energized.

                                     WILL
                         You color-code it. Half-red, half-
                         black.  If that's an integer--

               Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's that?

                                     WILL
                         Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --that?--

                                     WILL
                         --Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --That edge!

                                     WILL
                         An integer.

               The two stop. They are silent for a moment. Like two 
               gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (checks his watch)
                         It would appear we got that proof in 
                         under the wire after all. It's not 
                         how hard you look at things, young 
                         man, it's the way you look at them. 
                         If you take aim before you fire, you 
                         will find the most difficult problems 
                         become, quite literally, child's 
                         play.

               Will gets his coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, you've managed to offend four 
                         of my colleagues so much that they 
                         refused to come back. You're meeting 
                         with the leading hypnotist in the 
                         country next week and Tom and I plan 
                         to sit in on the sessions, so I expect 
                         you to behave appropriately.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits in a chair across from Lambeau and the HYPNOTIST.

               Lambeau's assistant, TOM (33) takes notes. The Hypnotist 
               makes small talk with Lambeau, who checks his watch.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Shall we start the, uh...

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You 
                         guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Yes, Will. We'll get to that. But 
                         first, why don't you go to sleep for 
                         me.

               He SNAPS HIS FINGERS and instantly Will's head goes BACK and 
               his EYES CLOSE. The Hypnotist gives Lambeau a look.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Would you mind standing on one leg?

               Will gets up and stands on one leg. Lambeau is impressed.

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER

               Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The 
               mood is more serious now.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now 
                         how old are you?

                                     WILL
                         Seven.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         And what do you see?

                                     WILL
                         Somethin's in my room.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         What is it?

                                     WILL
                         It's like a small figure, hoverin' 
                         over me. Gettin' closer.

               Will flinches.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You're in a safe place, Will.

                                     WILL
                         It's touching me.

               Lambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau] 
               with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Where is it touching you?

                                     WILL
                         Down there.
                              (indicating genitals)
                         And I'm nervous.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You don't have to be nervous, Will.

               Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause I'm not ready.
                              (calming)
                         But the figure tells me everything's 
                         gonna be all right. 'Cause the 
                         figure's a Libra too. And we start 
                         dancin' and it's beautiful--

               Will breaks into song at full volume.

                                     WILL
                         "SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!"

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (getting up)
                         Oh Jesus.

               The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door. 
               Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Barry.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         I have better ways to spend my time.

               He is gone. Will stops singing, laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, for God's sake, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this 
                         one on me. He left, I wanted to talk 
                         to him for another twenty minutes. I 
                         was havin' fun.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I told you to cooperate with these 
                         people.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece 
                         of work.

               Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of 
               Lambeau.

                                     WILL
                              (spooky voice)
                         Look into my eyes. I don't need 
                         therapy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Get out, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Okay... don't forget to get another 
                         therapist for next week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's enough.

               Will is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I called Mel Weintraub this morning, 
                         to check for availability.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's the point?

                                     TOM
                         What do you want to do?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         There is somebody...

                                     TOM
                         Who is he?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was my roommate in college.

               INT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY

               This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class. 
               Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall 
               could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here 
               today.

               Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired 
               of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the 
               tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student 
               body.

                                     SEAN
                         Establishing trust is the most 
                         important component in making 
                         breakthroughs with a patient. Why?

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         Maureen?

               MAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare.

                                     SEAN
                         Keep up the good work, Maureen. 
                         Vinnie?

               VINNIE looks up.

                                     VINNIE
                         Because trust is an important thing.

                                     SEAN
                         Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't 
                         your brother give you the notes? 
                         Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you 
                         then they won't feel safe enough to 
                         be honest with you -- then there's 
                         no point to them being in therapy. 
                         It's like saying -- "Fine, come here 
                         and don't tell me a thing but go 
                         home feeling like you're doing 
                         something about your problems -- and 
                         give me my fifty bucks before you 
                         leave will ya'!"

               He looks around the room for approval. No one is listening.

                                     SEAN
                         If you don't help them trust you -- 
                         then there's no way you'll ever get 
                         them to sleep with you. And that 
                         should be the goal of any good 
                         therapist. Insecure women, you know... 
                         nail 'em when they're vulnerable, 
                         that's always been my motto.

               The students look up, somewhat stunned.

                                     SEAN
                         See, I got Vinnie's attention.

               Laughter. Sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices 
               LAMBEAU standing in the back of the room. There is an awkward 
               moment.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean.

                                     SEAN
                              (to class)
                         Well, it seems we're in the presence 
                         of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau 
                         is a Field's Medal winner. 
                         Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.

               The students stare blankly.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello.

                                     SEAN
                         The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize 
                         for math.
                              (beat)
                         But it's only given out every four 
                         years.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         Okay, that's all for today. Try and 
                         get through Fernald by Monday.

               The class starts to pack up and file out. Lambeau approaches 
               Sean who steps down from the lectern.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Good to see you.

                                     SEAN
                         Good to see you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is there someplace we can talk?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar on their first date. They watch a street 
               MAGICIAN doing tricks with a rabbit. The guy's tricks are 
               pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work. 
               He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit, 
               the rabbit really does the tricks." Will gives Skylar a look 
               and they move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOY STORE -- LATER

               Will and Skylar walk into the small shop.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know, it was just kind of 
                         the boring suburban thing. Private 
                         school, Harvard, and now Med. School.
                              (Beat)
                         I actually figured out that at the 
                         end of it, my brain will be worth a 
                         quarter of a million dollars. I 
                         shouldn't have told you that...

                                     WILL
                         I bet your parents were happy to 
                         pay.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I was happy to pay. I inherited the 
                         money.

                         Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Stanford. I'm leaving in June after 
                         I graduate.

                                     WILL
                         So you just want to use me and go?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, I'm gonna experiment on you 
                         for my anatomy class, then go.

                                     WILL
                         In that case, fine.
                              (beat)
                         Want to see my magic trick?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Sure.

               Will, pulls out a bulging HANDFUL OF CARAMELS.

                                     WILL
                         Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels 
                         disappear.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay...

               Will goes into all manner of hocus-pocus theatrics. Then 
               shakes his hand wildly. The trick doesn't pan out and the 
               caramels go flying all over the store. Skylar laughs.

                                     WILL
                         It works better when I have my rabbit.

               Lambeau and Sean share a table at this exclusive restaurant.

               Sean seems slightly out of place in his wrinkled sport coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I didn't see you at the reunion.

                                     SEAN
                         I've been busy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You were missed.
                              (beat)
                         How long has it been since we've 
                         seen each other?

                                     SEAN
                         Since Nancy died.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm sorry, that damn conference--

                                     SEAN
                         I got your card.

               INT. HARVARD SQ. DINER: "THE TASTY" -- NIGHT

               A FRY COOK hands Will and Skylar a pair of CHEESEBURGERS.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Have you ever seen Annie Hall?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, there's this part of the movie 
                         that's about how there's always this 
                         tension on a first date where both 
                         people are thinking about what's 
                         going to happen with the whole 'good 
                         night kiss' thing.

               Will smiles.

                                     WILL
                         I really don't 'date' that much.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughs)
                         You know what I mean. I know you've 
                         at least thought about it.

                                     WILL
                         No I haven't...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes you have. You were thinking you 
                         were gonna get a good night kiss.

                                     WILL
                              (mock protest)
                         No I wasn't...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes you were.

                                     WILL
                         I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good 
                         night laid" but... I'll take a kiss.

               She laughs.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh, you will?

                                     WILL
                         No... I was hoping to get a kiss.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Then why don't we just get it out of 
                         the way.

               He looks at her.

                                     WILL
                         Now?

               Both of them have cheeseburger in their mouths.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah.

               They kiss, mouths full of burger. It's nice. A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         That had to be the worst good night 
                         kiss...

               Will laughs.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, look lady, I'm just here for 
                         the free food.

               She smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Free?

                                     WILL
                         Hey, I spent all my money on those 
                         caramels.

               She laughs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- SAME

               Lambeau and Sean, having finished their meal. Lambeau has 
               been pitching Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full 
                         schedule.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This kid's special, Sean. I've never 
                         seen anything like him.

                                     SEAN
                         Not much free time, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you ever heard of a man named 
                         Ramanujan?

               Sean nods his head.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was alive over a hundred years 
                         ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not 
                         feathers...

               Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny 
                         hut in India. No formal education, 
                         no access to other works. But he 
                         came across an old math book and 
                         from this basic text he was able to 
                         extrapolate theories that had baffled 
                         mathematicians for years.

                                     SEAN
                         And he mailed it to Hardy--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right, Sean. He mailed it to 
                         a professor at Cambridge who 
                         immediately recognized the brilliance 
                         in his work and brought Ramanujan to 
                         England.

                                     SEAN
                         Where he contracted pneumonia and 
                         died at a young age--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         They worked together for the remainder 
                         of their lives, producing some of 
                         the most exciting math theory ever 
                         done.  Ramanujan's genius was 
                         unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like 
                         that. But he's very defensive and I 
                         need someone who can get through to 
                         him.

                                     SEAN
                         Why me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I need someone with your kind of 
                         background.

                                     SEAN
                         My kind of background?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're from the same neighborhood. 
                         South Boston.

                                     SEAN
                         He's from Southie? How many people 
                         did you try before you came to me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (looks squarely at 
                              Sean)
                         Five.

               Sean gives a slight, knowing smile.

                                     SEAN
                         Who? Barry, Henry, Rick...

               Lambeau nods.

                                     SEAN
                         Not Rick? You didn't send him to 
                         Rick?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Just meet with the boy once a week.

                                     SEAN
                         Can we do it at my office?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be fine.

               The waiter comes with the CHECK. Each man reaches for it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, please.

                                     SEAN
                         I got it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's on the college.

               Sean relents.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean's office is comfortable. Books are stacked against the 
               wall. There is a PAINTING on the wall behind Sean. Sean is 
               seated behind a desk. Lambeau sits in a chair in the back of 
               the room, next to Tom. A long beat passes, they wait.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Any vulnerability he senses, he'll 
                         exploit.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be okay.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's a poker game with this young 
                         man.  Don't let him see what you've 
                         got.

               Sean nods. Will walks in. Everyone stands to greet Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello, Will. Any trouble finding the 
                         place?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, 
                         Will Hunting.

               Sean and Will nod. An awkward moment as the four men stand.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, let's get started.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, let's let the healing begin.

               Lambeau is slightly embarrassed. Sean smiles at Will's joke.

                                     SEAN
                         Would you excuse us?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Tom.

                                     SEAN
                         You too, Gerry.

               Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering.

               After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will 
               alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He 
               seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence 
               as Sean watches Will.

                                     SEAN
                         Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire.

               A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and 
               sits.

               He lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally-

                                     SEAN
                         Where are you from in Southie?

                                     WILL
                         Did you buy all these books retail, 
                         or do you send away for like a "shrink 
                         kit" that comes with all these volumes 
                         included?

                                     SEAN
                         Have you read all these books, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Probably not.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating a shelf)
                         How about the ones on that shelf?

               Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read those.

                                     SEAN
                         What did you think?

                                     WILL
                         I'm not here for a fuckin' book 
                         report.  They're your books, why 
                         don't you read 'em?

                                     SEAN
                         I did.

                                     WILL
                         That must have taken you a long time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah, it did take me a long time.

               Sean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident 
               manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair 
               and goes to the shelf.

                                     WILL
                              (looking at book)
                         "A History of the United States, 
                         Volume I." If you want to read a 
                         real history book, read Howard Zinn's 
                         "A People's History of the United 
                         States." That book will knock you on 
                         your ass.

                                     SEAN
                         How about Noam Chomsky's 
                         "Manufacturing Consent?"

                                     WILL
                         You people baffle me. You spend all 
                         this money on beautiful, fancy books-- 
                         and they're the wrong fuckin' books.

                                     SEAN
                         You think so?

                                     WILL
                         Whatever blows your hair back.

               Will returns to his chair. Pause.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating cigarette)
                         Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much.
                         Stunt your growth.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. It really gets in the 
                         way of my jazzercizing.

               Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He 
               remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his 
               face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence.

                                     WILL
                         Do you lift?

                                     SEAN
                         Yes, I do.

                                     WILL
                         Nautilus?

                                     SEAN
                         Free weights.

                                     WILL
                         Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?

                                     SEAN
                         285. 

                                     WILL
                         Oh.

               Will gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's 
               painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous 
               storm -- by no means a masterpiece. Will studies it.

                                     WILL
                         You paint this?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Do you paint?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         Crayons?

                                     WILL
                         This is a real piece of shit.

                                     SEAN
                         Tell me what you really think.

                                     WILL
                         Poor color composition, lousy use of 
                         space. But that shit doesn't really 
                         concern me.

                                     SEAN
                         What does?

                                     WILL
                         The color here, see how dark it is? 
                         It's interesting.

                                     SEAN
                         What is?

                                     WILL
                         I think you're one step away from 
                         cutting your ear off.

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?

                                     WILL
                         You ever heard the saying, "any port 
                         in a storm?"

                                     SEAN
                         Sure, how 'bout "still waters run 
                         deep"-

                                     WILL
                         --Well, maybe that means you.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe what mea--

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you were in the middle of a 
                         storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the 
                         waves were crashing over the bow, 
                         the Goddamned mast was about to snap, 
                         and you were crying for the harbor. 
                         So you did what you had to do, to 
                         get out.  Maybe you became a 
                         psychologist.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe you should be a patient and 
                         sit down.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you married the wrong woman.

                                     SEAN
                         Watch your mouth.

                                     WILL
                         That's it isn't it? You married the 
                         wrong woman. She leave you? Was she 
                         bangin' someone else?

               Sean is walking slowly towards Will.

                                     WILL
                         How are the seas now, D--

               In a flash, Sean has Will by the throat. Will is helpless.

                                     SEAN
                         If you ever disrespect my wife 
                         again... I will end you.

                                     WILL
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               Will walks out of Sean's office past Lambeau and Tom who are 
               sitting in the hallway.

                                     WILL
                         At ease, gentlemen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean stands behind his desk in his office, still very much 
               on edge. Lambeau walks in.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Five minutes, Sean. Are you okay?

               A pause, Sean is staring at his painting.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll understand if you don't want to 
                         meet with him again.

                                     SEAN
                         Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure 
                         the kid is here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WONDERLAND RACETRACK -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run. 
               They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and 
               America.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You grew up around here?

                                     WILL
                         Not far from here, South Boston.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How was that?

                                     WILL
                         Pretty boring, I guess.

               She smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I bet you have a great family.

                                     WILL
                         You know, nothing special.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     WILL
                         Do I have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         Well, Irish Catholic. What do you 
                         think?

                                     SKYLAR
                         How many?

                                     WILL
                         You wouldn't believe me if I told 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What, five?

               Will shakes his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Seven?

               Will shakes his head. Smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come on.

                                     WILL
                         I have twelve big brothers.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Not a chance.

                                     WILL
                         Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Bullshit.

                                     WILL
                         I swear to God.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Your house must have been a zoo.

                                     WILL
                         It was great. There was always someone 
                         to play with, give you advice.

                         Do you know all their names?

                                     WILL
                         'Course I do, they're my brothers.

                         Well...

                                     WILL

                              (laughing)
                         Do you keep in touch with them?

                                     WILL
                         All the time. We all live in Southie. 
                         I live with three of them now.

               Skylar smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want to meet them.

                                     WILL
                         We'll do that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               As we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn 
               with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes. Although, if 
               it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare. 
               A framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover featuring a screaming Larry 
               Bird and entitled "CELTIC PRIDE" hangs on the wall. Sean 
               sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of 
               BUSHMILL'S IRISH WHISKEY. He is deep in thought.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will strolls into the office. Sean is waiting there behind 
               his desk. He seems different. More calm. Will and Sean stare 
               at each other for a long moment.

                                     WILL
                         You again. How the paintin' coming?

               Sean stands up.

                                     SEAN
                         Come with me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER

               Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.

               They look out over a small pond, in which a group of 
               schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.

                                     WILL
                         So what's with this place? You have 
                         a swan fetish? Is this something 
                         you'd like to talk about?

                                     SEAN
                         I was thinking about what you said 
                         to me the other day, about my 
                         painting. I stayed up half the night 
                         thinking about it and then something 
                         occurred to me and I fell into a 
                         deep peaceful sleep and haven't 
                         thought about you since. You know 
                         what occurred to me?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         You're just a boy. You don't have 
                         the faintest idea what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     WILL
                         Why thank you.

                                     SEAN
                         You've never been out of Boston.

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         So if I asked you about art you could 
                         give me the skinny on every art book 
                         ever written... Michelangelo? You 
                         know a lot about him I bet. Life's 
                         work, criticisms, political 
                         aspirations. But you couldn't tell 
                         me what it smells like in the Sistine 
                         Chapel. You've never stood there and 
                         looked up at that beautiful ceiling. 
                         And if I asked you about women I'm 
                         sure you could give me a syllabus of 
                         your personal favorites, and maybe 
                         you've been laid a few times too.
                         But you couldn't tell me how it feels 
                         to wake up next to a woman and be 
                         truly happy. If I asked you about 
                         war you could refer me to a bevy of 
                         fictional and non-fictional material, 
                         but you've never been in one. You've 
                         never held your best friend's head 
                         in your lap and watched him draw his 
                         last breath, looking to you for help. 
                         And if I asked you about love I'd 
                         get a sonnet, but you've never looked 
                         at a woman and been truly vulnerable. 
                         Known that someone could kill you 
                         with a look. That someone could rescue 
                         you from grief. That God had put an 
                         angel on Earth just for you.  And 
                         you wouldn't know how it felt to be 
                         her angel. To have the love be there 
                         for her forever. Through anything, 
                         through cancer. You wouldn't know 
                         about sleeping sitting up in a 
                         hospital room for two months holding 
                         her hand and not leaving because the 
                         doctors could see in your eyes that 
                         the term "visiting hours" didn't 
                         apply to you. And you wouldn't know 
                         about real loss, because that only 
                         occurs when you lose something you 
                         love more than yourself, and you've 
                         never dared to love anything that 
                         much. I look at you and I don't see 
                         an intelligent confident man, I don't 
                         see a peer, and I don't see my equal. 
                         I see a boy. Nobody could possibly 
                         understand you, right Will? Yet you 
                         presume to know so much about me 
                         because of a painting you saw.  You 
                         must know everything about me.  You're 
                         an orphan, right?

               Will nods quietly.

                                     SEAN
                         Do you think I would presume to know 
                         the first thing about who you are 
                         because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I 
                         don't buy the argument that you don't 
                         want to be here, because I think you 
                         like all the attention you're getting. 
                         Personally, I don't care. There's 
                         nothing you can tell me that I can't 
                         read somewhere else.  Unless we talk 
                         about your life. But you won't do 
                         that. Maybe you're afraid of what 
                         you might say.

               Sean stands,

                                     SEAN
                         It's up to you.

               And walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Will and Chuckie doing demo at the site. They throw 
               cinderblocks out a window into a pile. They are filthy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- NIGHT

               Rain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac 
               fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the 
               back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hello?

               Will hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Who'd you call?

                                     WILL
                         No one. I didn't have the number.

                                     MORGAN
                         What are you, retarded? You went all 
                         the way out there in the rain and 
                         you didn't have the number?

                                     WILL
                         No, it was your mother's 900 number. 
                         I just ran out of quarters.

               Laughter. Chuckie pulls away from the curb.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why don't we get off mothers, I just 
                         got off yours.

               There is a long moment of silence in response to Morgan's 
               attempt at levity. Then laughter.

                                     BILLY
                         You're a pretty funny guy. Here, 
                         have a nickel.

               Billy WHIPS his EMPTY BEER CAN off of Morgan's head.

                                     MORGAN
                         Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what 
                         happens.

                                     BILLY
                         All right, then.

                                     MORGAN
                         Watch what happens.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from Sean completely silent and takes out a 
               pack of cigarettes.

                                     SEAN
                         No smoking.

               Will puts the cigarettes away. Sean stares at Will and 
               occasionally at the clock. Sean continues to check the clock 
               on the wall. It is the only clock in the room and it is BEHIND 
               Will. Their hour is almost up.

               CLOSE ON: WILL'S EYES INTERCUT WITH THE CLOCK.

               He is counting seconds. As the second hand crosses the twelve, 
               Will stands up and walks out, leaving Sean alone.

               INT. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau and Sean walk down the hallway after the session.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What do you mean "he didn't talk?" 
                         You sat there for an hour?

                                     SEAN
                         No, he just sat there and counted 
                         the seconds until the session was 
                         over. It was pretty impressive, 
                         actually.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why would he do that?

                                     SEAN
                         To show me he doesn't have to talk 
                         to me if he doesn't want to.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring 
                         contest between two kids from the 
                         "old neighborhood?"

                                     SEAN
                         I won't talk first.

               Chuckie drops Will off at his apartment, watches him [Will] 
               walk up the steps.

               Chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to Will's 
               front door. After a beat, Will emerges. They get back in 
               [the car].

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- NIGHT

               The bar is a bit more crowded than usual. Will and Chuckie 
               walk back to their table, carrying beers. They pass a table 
               of GIRLS, local regulars getting just as bombed as the guys. 
               These girls are a little overdone. Too much make-up, too 
               much hairspray, and too much body for such tight outfits. 
               One of the girls, KRYSTYN, smiles at Will who seems subdued.

                                     KRYSTYN
                         Hi, Will.

                                     WILL
                         How you doin', Krystyn.

               They pass the table of girls. Chuckie looks at one, ruefully.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I didn't get on Cathy last night.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know.

               Chuckie turns back to one of the girls, calling out:

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cathy! Why didn't you give me none 
                         of your twat last night?

               A girl at the table, CATHY, holds up her PINKY FINGER and 
               smiles -- revealing a mouthful of MISSING TEETH.

                                     CATHY
                         Fuck you and your Irish curse, 
                         Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She's missin' teeth, Will.

               Will nods, not really into it tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Plus, it's like, five to two Morgan 
                         ends up marryin' her. There's only 
                         so many times you can bang your 
                         friend's future wife...

               They get to the table. Will's heart just isn't in it.

                                     WILL
                         I'm takin' off.

                                     ALL
                         We're goin' late night.

                                     WILL
                         I'm tired.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Lambeau work together at the board. They communicate 
               non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a 
               particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look 
               and laugh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean 
               casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restlessly 
               looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half 
               smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment:

                                     WILL
                         You know, I was on this plane once. 
                         And I'm sittin' there and the captain 
                         comes on and is like "we'll be 
                         cruising at 35,000 feet," and does 
                         his thing, then he puts the mike 
                         down but forgets to turn it off. 
                         Then he says "man, all I want right 
                         now is a blow-job and a cup of 
                         coffee."  So the stewardess goes 
                         runnin' up towards the cock-pit to 
                         tell him the mike's still on, and 
                         this guy in the back of the plane 
                         goes "don't forget the coffee!"

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         You've never been on a plane.

                                     WILL
                         I know, but the joke's better if I 
                         tell it in the first person.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I have been laid you know.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah? You got a lady now?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I went on a date last week.

                                     SEAN
                         How'd it go?

                                     WILL
                         Fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, are you going out again?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know.

                                     SEAN
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         Haven't called her.

                                     SEAN
                         Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.

                                     WILL
                         I know what I'm doing. She's different 
                         from the other girls I met. We have 
                         a really good time. She's smart, 
                         beautiful, fun...

                                     SEAN
                         So Christ, call her up.

                                     WILL
                         Why? So I can realize she's not so 
                         smart. That she's boring. You don't 
                         get it. Right now she's perfect, I 
                         don't want to ruin that.

                                     SEAN
                         And right now you're perfect too. 
                         Maybe you don't want to ruin that.

               Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, I think that's a great 
                         philosophy Will, that way you can go 
                         through your entire life without 
                         ever having to really know anybody.

               Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife used to turn the alarm clock 
                         off in her sleep. I was late for 
                         work all the time because in the 
                         middle of the night she'd roll over 
                         and turn the damn thing off. 
                         Eventually I got a second clock and 
                         put it under my side of the bed, but 
                         it got to where she was gettin' to 
                         that one too. She was afraid of the 
                         dark, so the closet light was on all 
                         night. Thing kept me up half the 
                         night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, 
                         out of sheer exhaustion and not wake 
                         up when I was supposed to cause she'd 
                         have already gotten to my alarms.

               Will smiles, Sean takes a beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's been dead two years, Will. 
                         And when I think about her, those 
                         are the things I think about most. 
                         Little idiosyncrasies that only I 
                         knew about.  Those made her my wife. 
                         And she had the goods on me too. 
                         Little things I do out of habit. 
                         People call these things imperfections 
                         Will. It's just who we are. And we 
                         get to choose who we're going to let 
                         into out weird little worlds. You're 
                         not perfect. And let me save you the 
                         suspense, this girl you met isn't 
                         either. The question is, whether or 
                         not you're perfect for each other.  
                         You can know everything in the world, 
                         but the only way you're findin' that 
                         one out is by giving it a shot. You 
                         sure won't get the answer from an 
                         old fucker like me. And even if I 
                         did know, I wouldn't tell you.

               Will smiles. A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Why not? You told me every other 
                         fuckin' thing. You talk more than 
                         any shrink I ever met.

               Sean laughs.

                                     SEAN
                         I teach this shit, I didn't say I 
                         knew how to do it.

                                     WILL
                         You ever think about gettin' 
                         remarried?

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Hence, the word remarried.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Well I think that's a wonderful 
                         philosophy, Sean. That way you can 
                         go through the rest of your life 
                         without having to really know anyone.

               A beat. Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               Will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out -- 
               so he can go in.

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               The door to Skylar's dorm is partially open. Will stands 
               outside while Skylar remains on the threshold.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Where have you been?

                                     WILL
                         I'm sorry, I been real busy.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You were busy? You know, I really 
                         was waiting for you to call me.

                                     WILL
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another 
                         crack at it. Let me take you out.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You should have called. I have an "O-
                         chem" lab due tomorrow and it's 
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         It's not an excuse dummy. I want to 
                         go out with you. But look:

               She holds up her Lab. Will glances at it.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Tomorrow?

                                     WILL
                         Promise?

                                     SKYLAR
                         If you bring the caramels.

               Will smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- LATER

               Will sits in an outdoor cafe, thinking. After a beat, he 
               leans over to two students working at a nearby table, borrows 
               a pen and paper and starts writing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               Will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn. He stops 
               at Skylar's dorm and knocks on the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               She emerges. He hands her the paper he was working on. It is 
               her O-chem lab.

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How the hell did you do that?

                                     WILL
                         Didn't your mother ever tell you not 
                         to look a gift horse in the mouth?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm supposed to understand this.

                                     WILL
                         You're not going into surgery tomorrow 
                         are you?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         Then let's go have some fun.

               With a smile, she relents.

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean and Will in session.

                                     SEAN
                         Really? How'd the date go?

                                     WILL
                         Do you still counsel veterans?
                              (beat)
                         I read your book last night.

                                     SEAN
                         No, I don't.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     SEAN
                         I gave that up when my wife got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Is that why you didn't write anything 
                         else?

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         I didn't write anything else 'cause 
                         nobody, including most of my 
                         colleagues bothered to read the first 
                         one.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I've read you colleagues. Your 
                         book was good, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         All those guys were in your platoon?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         What happened to that guy from 
                         Kentucky?

                                     SEAN
                         Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I 
                         kind of lost touch with him after 
                         Nancy got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Do you ever wonder what your life 
                         would be like if you never met your 
                         wife?

                                     SEAN
                         What? Do I wonder if I'd be better 
                         off if I never met my wife?

               Will starts to clarify his question.

                                     SEAN
                         No, that's okay. It's an important 
                         question. 'Cause you'll have your 
                         bad times, which wake you up to the 
                         good stuff you weren't paying 
                         attention to.  And you can fail, as 
                         long as you're trying hard. But 
                         there's nothing worse than regret.

                                     WILL
                         You don't regret meetin' your wife?

                                     SEAN
                         Why? Because of the pain I feel now? 
                         I have regrets Will, but I don't 
                         regret a singel day I spent with 
                         her.

                                     WILL
                         When did you know she was the one?

                                     SEAN
                         October 21, 1975. Game six of the 
                         World Series. Biggest game in Red 
                         Sox history, Me and my friends slept 
                         out on the sidewalk all night to get 
                         tickets. We were sitting in a bar 
                         waiting for the game to start and in 
                         walks this girl.  What a game that 
                         was. Tie game in the bottom of the 
                         tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, 
                         hit a long fly ball down the left 
                         field line. Thirty-five thousand 
                         fans on their feet, screamin' at the 
                         ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' 
                         up the baseline, wavin' at the ball 
                         like a madman. It hits the foul pole, 
                         home run. Thirty-five thousand people 
                         went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Where were you?

                                     SEAN
                         I was havin' a drink with my future 
                         wife.

                                     WILL
                         You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to 
                         have a drink with a woman you had 
                         never met?

                                     SEAN
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't 
                         won a World Series since nineteen 
                         eighteen, you slept out for tickets, 
                         games gonna start in twenty minutes, 
                         in walks a girl you never seen before, 
                         and you give your ticket away?

                                     SEAN
                         You should have seen this girl. She 
                         lit up the room.

                                     WILL
                         I don't care if Helen of Troy walked 
                         into that bar! That's game six of 
                         the World Series!

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         And what kind of friends are these? 
                         They let you get away with that?

                                     SEAN
                         I just slid my ticket across the 
                         table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta 
                         go see about a girl."

                                     WILL
                         "I gotta go see about a girl"? What 
                         did they say?

                                     SEAN
                         They could see that I meant it.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     SEAN
                         No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I 
                         had gone to see that game I'd be in 
                         here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a 
                         bar twenty years ago. And how I always 
                         regretted not goin' over there and 
                         talkin' to her. I don't regret the 
                         eighteen years we were married. I 
                         don't regret givin' up counseling 
                         for six years when she got sick. I 
                         don't regret being by her side for 
                         the last two years when things got 
                         real bad. And I sure as Hell don't 
                         regret missing that damn game.

               A beat. Will is impressed.

                                     WILL
                         Would have been nice to catch that 
                         game though.

                                     SEAN
                              (breaking)
                         Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was 
                         gonna hit the home run.

               They laugh.

                                                          TIME DISSOLVE TO:

               INT LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               The office is more crowded than usual. TOM and THREE of 
               LAMBEAU'S COLLEAGUES including the esteemed ALEXANDER PEKEC 
               are in the room. Will sits at a work-station which projects 
               a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard. Lambeau stands 
               beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec, 
               a foreign mathematician. The image is of a Ramses graph binary 
               tree.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, I know your theory. The 
                         boy is updating, he's strategy 
                         stealing...

                                     PEKEC
                         With a Ramses graph on the binary 
                         tree--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --But what he's doing, he's attaching 
                         an edge to the adjacent vertex. He 
                         can always failsafe to either side--

                                     PEKEC
                         Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!

               Pekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board.

                                     PEKEC
                         But I can always garbage out
                              (writes frantically)
                         All the way to "N" to the minus one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, there's a limit.

                                     PEKEC
                         The limit is not found!
                              (turns to Will)
                         The limit is not found.

                                     WILL
                         But I can always go to the other 
                         side.

                                     PEKEC
                         There is no proof--

               Lambeau can no longer contain himself.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is 
                         three to the K times--

                                     PEKEC
                         --But--

                                     WILL
                         Look, I wrote it down.

               They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The 
               image is cast over their faces. It reads:

               As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him:

                                     WILL
                         It's just simpler this way.

               Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, your theory is changed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar in her room, post coital. They are wrapped 
               in a sheet. Will is absent-mindedly playing the memory game 
               SIMON.

               The pattern grows increasingly complex. After a beat:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why do we always stay here?

                                     WILL
                         'Cause it's nicer than my place.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've never seen your place.

                                     WILL
                         Exactly.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your friends? Or your 
                         brothers? When do I get to meet them?

                                     WILL
                         They don't come over here that much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I think I can make it to South Boston.

                                     WILL
                         Aah, it's kind of a hike.

                         Is it me you're hiding from them or 
                         the other way around?

                                     WILL
                         All right, all right. We'll go.

                                     SKYLAR
                         When?

                                     WILL
                         Sometime. I don't know. Next week.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What if I said I wouldn't sleep with 
                         you again until you let me meet your 
                         friends?

                                     WILL
                         I'd say...
                              (reaches for phone)
                         It's only four in the mornin', they're 
                         prob'ly up.

               She laughs. Stops him.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You men are shameful. If you're not 
                         thinking of your wiener then you're 
                         acting on its behalf.

                                     WILL
                         Then on behalf of my wiener, I'd 
                         like to ask for an advance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER

               Skylar and Will sit together along with Will's gang. The 
               boys are considerably drunk, but it makes for good 
               entertainment.

               Everyone here is having fun including Sylar.

                                     MORGAN
                         Will, I can't believe you brought 
                         Skylar here when we're all wrecked. 
                         What's she gonna think about us?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity 
                         that we'd be out drinkin'.

                                     BILLY
                         I've been shit faced for like two 
                         weeks.

                                     MORGAN
                         Oh great, tell her that! Now she 
                         really thinks we're problem drinkers!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle 
                         Marty? Will knows him. That guy 
                         fuckin' drinks like you've never 
                         seen! One night he was drivin' back 
                         to his house on I-93 -- Statie pulls 
                         him over.

                                     ALL
                         Oh shit.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Guy's tryin' to walk the line -- but 
                         he can't even fuckin' stand up, and 
                         so my uncle's gonna spend a night in 
                         jail.  Just then there's this fuckin' 
                         BOOM like fifty yards down the road. 
                         Some guy's car hit a tree.

                                     MORGAN
                         Some other guy?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, he was probably drunker than 
                         my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the 
                         cop goes "Stay here" And he goes 
                         runnin' down the highway to deal 
                         with the other crash. So, my Uncle 
                         Marty's standin' on the side of the 
                         road for a little while, and he's so 
                         fuckin' lit, that he forgets what 
                         he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck 
                         it." He gets in his car and drives 
                         home.

                                     MORGAN
                         Holy shit.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So in the morning, there's a knock 
                         on the door it's the Statie. So my 
                         Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" 
                         And the Statie's like "I pulled you 
                         over and you took off."  And my 
                         Uncle's like "I never seen you before 
                         in my life, I been home all night 
                         with my kids." And Statie's like 
                         "Let me get in your garage!" So he's 
                         like "All right, fine." He takes 
                         around the garage and opens the door --
                         and the Statie's cruiser is in my 
                         Uncle's garage.

                                     ALL
                         No way! You're kiddin'!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, he was so hammered that he drove 
                         the police cruiser home. Fuckin' 
                         lights and everything!

                                     MORGAN
                         Did your Uncle get arrested?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed 
                         he didn't do anything. The fuckin' 
                         guy had been drivin' around in my 
                         Uncle's car all night lookin' for 
                         the house.

               Everyone is laughing. Skylar speaks above the din.

                                     SKYLAR
                         There was this Irish guy, walking 
                         down the beach one day.

               She has everyone's attention. Will is nervous.

                                     SKYLAR
                         And he comes across a bottle, and 
                         this Genie pops out. The genie turns 
                         to the Irishman and says -- "You've 
                         released me from my prison, so I'll 
                         grant you three wishes." The Irish 
                         guy thinks for a minute and says 
                         "What I really want is a pint of 
                         Guiness that never empties."  And -- 
                         POOF! A bottle appears. He slams it 
                         down, and -- lo and behold -- it 
                         fills back up again.

               C/U of Will. Hoping the joke pans out.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, the Irish guy can't believe 
                         it. He drinks it again, and again -- 
                         BOOM!  It fills back up. So, while 
                         the Irish guy is marveling at his 
                         good fortune, The Genie is getting 
                         impatient, because it's hot and he 
                         wants to get on with his freedom. He 
                         says "Let's go, you have two more 
                         wishes." The Irish guy slams his 
                         drink again, it fills back up, he's 
                         still amazed. The Genie can't take 
                         it anymore. He says "Buddy, I'm 
                         boiling out here. What are your other 
                         two wishes?"
                              (beat)
                         The Irish guy looks at his drink, 
                         looks at the Genie and says... "I 
                         guess I'll have two more of these."

               The gang erupts with laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a good thing no one's Irish 
                         here.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm Irish.

               Chuckie, Will look at Morgan, baffled.

               EXT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER

               Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over 
               to Will and Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I'm glad you came by, changed my 
                         opinion of Harvard people.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.

               Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what the fuck you're 
                         doin'.  You're givin' us a ride.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do I look like, Al Cowlins?
                              (seriously)
                         You want to take my car, drop her 
                         off?

                                     WILL
                         I was countin' on it.

                                     MORGAN
                         Chuck, let's go.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' 
                         the car.

               Morgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows 
               with an indifferent shrug.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks, Chuck.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Don't get too slap-happy, you're 
                         takin' me home first.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta 
                         the way.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just 'cause you don't have to sleep 
                         in the one room palace, don't start 
                         thinkin' you're bad.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (to Will)
                         I thought you said you'd show me 
                         your place.

                                     WILL
                         Not tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, not tonight. Not any other 
                         night.

               He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped 
               like a bad habit.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I wanted to meet your brothers...

               Chuckie gives Will a curious look.

                                     WILL
                         They're all sleepin' now.
                              (a beat, to Chuckie)
                         Let me get those keys.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FACULTY CLUB -- NIGHT

               A cocktail party is underway. Professors mingle with

               representatives from high tech companies. Lambeau stands 
               holding a drink and surrounded by several RECRUITERS. 
               Apparently he's the star of the show.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         What I want to know, Gerry, is when 
                         we get to meet this wonder-boy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         We're still working together, the 
                         boy's a little rough.

                                     RECRUITER #2
                         We've got our share of eccentric 
                         geniuses at Tri-tech. We know how to 
                         deal with that.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         I think we all do.

               Laughter.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         If you're not exaggerating, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty-
                         four when I told you I'd win the 
                         Field's medal within two years?

               More laughter.

                         In that case the boy could run 
                         shipping for us, routing--

                         You say he doesn't have a diploma,

                         I don't need to see a driver's 
                         license.  I can think of three 
                         departments right now that he could 
                         head up for us.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         At ease, gentlemen. We're looking 
                         carefully at all our options.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         All right, Gerry. Close to the vest.
                              (gives him his card)
                         Good luck with these vultures.

               He walks off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TIMMY'S TAP -- DAY

               Timmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the L Street 
               Bar. Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to TIMMY (45) the 
               owner of the place, and several other REGULARS.

                                     SEAN
                         So she goes runnin' up the aisle and 
                         I figure "fuck it" and I yell out 
                         "don't forget the coffee!

               The men erupt in laughter. MARTY, one of the regulars pipe 
               up.

                                     MARTY
                         Bullshit! You didn't say that!

               Timmy and Sean exchange a look.

                                     TIMMY
                         Jesus Christ, Marty. It's a joke.

               Lambeau enters, a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Not at all.

                                     SEAN
                         Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend 
                         of mine. We went to college together.

                                     TIMMY
                         Good to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Pleasure to meet you.

                                     SEAN
                         Could we get a couple of sandwiches?
                              (beat, smiles)
                         Put it on my tab.

               Sean heads towards a table.

                                     TIMMY
                         You ever plan on payin' your tab?

                                     SEAN
                              (pulls out lottery 
                              ticket)
                         I got the winning numbers right here.

                                     TIMMY
                         What's the jackpot?

                                     SEAN
                         Twelve million.

                                     TIMMY
                         I don't think that'll cover it.

               Lambeau follows [Sean]. They sit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're here quite a bit, then.

                                     SEAN
                         I live right around the corner.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You moved?

                                     SEAN
                         I been here a couple years.

               There is an awkward moment.

                                     SEAN
                         You wanted to talk about Will?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Seems like it's going well.

                                     SEAN
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, have you talked to him at all 
                         about his future?

                                     SEAN
                         We haven't really gotten into it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maybe you should. My phone's been 
                         ringing off the hook with job offers.

                                     SEAN
                         Jobs doing what?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks.
                         The kind of place where a mind like 
                         Will's is given free reign.

                                     SEAN
                         That's great, Gerry, that there's 
                         interest -- But I'm not sure he's 
                         ready for that.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I really don't think you 
                         understand--

                                     SEAN
                         What don't I understand?

               Timmy comes over with the sandwiches.

                                     SEAN
                         Thanks, Timmy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us?
                         We're trying to settle a bet.

                                     TIMMY
                         Uh-oh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you heard of Jonas Salk?

                                     TIMMY
                         Yeah, cured polio.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You've heard of Albert Einstein?

               Timmy smiles. Gives him a look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard 
                         of him?

                                     TIMMY
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay thank you, Timmy.

                                     TIMMY
                         So who won the bet?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I did.

               A beat. Timmy leaves.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This isn't about me. I'm nothing 
                         compared to this young man.
                              (beat)
                         Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of 
                         Professors who were renowned for 
                         their study of the universe. But it 
                         was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk, 
                         doing physics in his spare time, who 
                         changed the world, Sean. Can you 
                         imagine if Einstein had given that 
                         up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies 
                         in Vienna every night? All of us 
                         would have lost something. And I'm 
                         quite sure Timmy never would have 
                         heard of him.

                                     SEAN
                         Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He 
                         just hasn't got the direction. We 
                         can give that to him.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         He married his cousin.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Who?

                                     SEAN
                         Einstein. Had two marriages, both 
                         trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his 
                         kids, one of whom, I think, ended up 
                         in an asylum- possible Unabomber 
                         addition--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You see, Sean? That's exactly not 
                         the point. No one remembers that. 
                         They--

                                     SEAN
                         I do.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, you're the only one.

               Beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This boy can make contributions to 
                         the world. We can help him do that.

                                     SEAN
                         Just... take it easy, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, I don't know what else I can 
                         say.  I'm not sitting at home every 
                         night, twisting my mustache and 
                         hatching a plan to ruin the boy's 
                         life. But it's important to start 
                         early. I was doing advanced 
                         mathematics at eighteen and it still 
                         took me twenty-three years to do 
                         something worthy of a Field's medal.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe he doesn't care about that.

               A beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, this is important. And it's 
                         above personal rivalry--

                                     SEAN
                         Now wait a minute, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no you hear me out, Sean. This 
                         young man is a true prodigy--

                                     SEAN
                         Personal rivalry? I'm not getting 
                         back at you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, you took one road and I took 
                         another. That's fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think 
                         it's fine with you. Give him time to 
                         figure out what he wants.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It 
                         worked wonders for you.

               A beat. Lambeau gets up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I came here today out of 
                         courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in 
                         the loop. As we speak the boy is in 
                         a meeting I set up for him over at 
                         Tri-tech.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, OFFICE -- SAME

               Three well dressed TRI-TECH EXECUTIVES sit around a conference 
               table, which is littered with promotional brochures. The 
               executives exchange a confused look. One of them speaks.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                              (tentative)
                         Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure 
                         what you mean, we've already offered 
                         you a position..

               Cut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives, 
               hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Since this is obviously not my first 
                         time in such altercations, let me 
                         say this:

               Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating 
               "cash." The executives are baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, we can do this the easy way or 
                         the hard way.

               The executives are completely blank.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         At the current time I am looking at 
                         a number of different fields from 
                         which to disseminate which offer is 
                         most pursuant aid to my benefit.
                              (a beat)
                         What do you want? What do I want? 
                         What does anybody want? Leniency.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I'm not sure--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         --These circumstances are mitigated.
                         Right now. They're mitigated.

               Chuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the 
               room.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Okay...

               Chuckie points to the third executive.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         He knows what I'm talking about.

               The third executive is baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         A retainer. Nobody in this town works 
                         without a retainer. You think you 
                         can find someone who does, you have 
                         my blessin'. But I think we all know 
                         that person isn't going to represent 
                         you as well as I can.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will, our offer starts you at eighty-
                         four thousand a year, plus benefits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Retainer...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         You want us to give you cash right 
                         now?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Allegedly, what I am saying is your 
                         situation will be concurrently 
                         improved if I had two hundred sheets 
                         in my pocket right now.

               The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I don't think I... Larry?

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I have about seventy-three...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will you take a check?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Come now... what do you think I am, 
                         a juvenile? You don't got any money 
                         on you right now. You think I'm gonna 
                         take a check?

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         It's fine, John, I can cover the 
                         rest.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         That's right, you know.
                              (turns to #1)
                         He knows.

               Chuckie stands up and takes the money.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (to exec #1)
                         You're suspect. I don't know what 
                         your reputation is, but after the 
                         shit you tried to pull today, you 
                         can bet I'll be looking into it. Any 
                         conversations you want to have with 
                         me heretofore, you can have with my 
                         attorney. Gentlemen, keep your ears 
                         to the grindstone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AU BON PAIN COURTYARD, HARVARD SQUARE -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the open courtyard of this Harvard 
               Square eatery. Skylar is working on another O-chem lab. Will 
               sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.

                                     WILL
                         How's it goin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fine.

                                     WILL
                         Want me to take a look?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go 
                         to the battin' cages.

                                     SKYLAR
                         It's important that I learn this.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it important to you? If I 
                         inherited all that money, the only 
                         thing important to me would be workin' 
                         on my swing.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Clearly.

                                     WILL
                         You're rich. What do you have to 
                         worry about?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Rich? I have an inheritance. It's 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars.  That's exactly what it'll 
                         cost me, minus about five hundred 
                         bucks, to go all the way through med 
                         school. This is what I'm doing with 
                         that money. I could have done anything 
                         I wanted. I could have expanded my 
                         wardrobe, substantially.

                                     WILL
                         Instead you're going to bust your 
                         ass for five years so you can be 
                         broke?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No, so I can be a doctor.

               A beat. Will nods. She looks down, then up.

                                     SKYLAR
                         All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me 
                         ask you a question? Do you have a 
                         photographic memory?

                                     WILL
                         I guess. I don't know. How do you 
                         remember your phone number?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Have you ever studied Organic 
                         Chemistry?

                                     WILL
                         Some, a little.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Just for fun?

                                     WILL
                         I guess so.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Nobody does organic chemistry for 
                         "fun."  It's unnecessary. Especially 
                         for someone like you.

                                     WILL
                         Like me?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah. Someone like you who divides 
                         his time, fairly evenly, between the 
                         batting cages and bars.

               Will laughs.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How did you do that? I can't... I 
                         mean even the smartest people I know, 
                         and we do have a few at Harvard, 
                         have to study- a lot. It's hard.
                              (beat)
                         Listen, Will, if you don't want to 
                         tell me--

                                     WILL
                         Do you play the piano?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come one Will. I just want to know.

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to explain it to you. So 
                         you play the piano. When you look at 
                         the keys, you see music, you see 
                         Mozart.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.

                                     WILL
                         Well all right, Beethoven. He looked 
                         at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' 
                         guy was deaf when he composed the 
                         Ode to Joy. They had to turn him 
                         around to take a bow because he 
                         couldn't hear the crowd going crazy 
                         behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all 
                         of that music in his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         So, do you play the piano?

                                     WILL
                         Not a lick. I look at a piano and I 
                         see black and white keys, three pedals 
                         and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, 
                         they looked at it and it just made 
                         sense to them. They saw a piano and 
                         they could play. I couldn't paint 
                         you a picture, I probably can't hit 
                         the ball out of Fenway Park and I 
                         can't play the piano--

                                     SKYLAR
                         But you can do my O-chem lab in under 
                         an hour, you can--

                                     WILL
                         When it came to stuff like that I 
                         could always just play.

               Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp. 
               So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I can't believe it's taken me four 
                         years to meet you and I'm going to 
                         California in two months, Will.
                              (beat)
                         Have you ever been to California? I 
                         bet you'd like it.

               Will freezes. A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe not.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHUCKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Chuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers 
               and a tee-shirt, eating cereal. The doorbell rings. He sits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Get it, ma!

               She doesn't. He gets up. Opens door. It's Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (surprised)
                         Hey.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hi.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How you doin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Good.

               An awkward beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How'd you know where to find me?

                                     SKYLAR

                         You were the only Sullivan in the 
                         phone book.

               Chuckie smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will and I dropped you off here, 
                         remember?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh, right.

                                     SKYLAR
                         This is your house, right?

               Chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted 
               by a nagging shriek from his mom.

                                     CHUCKIE'S MOM (O.S.)
                         Get in here, Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (calling back)
                         Pipe down, Ma!

                                     SKYLAR
                         I guess so.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What? No. This is my mother's house. 
                         I don't live with my mother. I just 
                         stop by, help out. I'm good like 
                         that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is this a bad time?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She'll live.
                              (beat)
                         If she starts yelling again I might 
                         have to run in real quick and beat 
                         her with the stick again but...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let's take a walk.

               EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY

               Chuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, now this doesn't feel right.
                              (beat)
                         When I made the decision to come 
                         over here it felt right. I had all 
                         these rationalizations... I just 
                         don't understand why Will never tells 
                         me anything, he won't let me get 
                         close to him, he tells me these weird 
                         lies--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You caught that, huh?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I just wanted to find out what was 
                         going on... But now that I'm here it 
                         seems strange, doesn't it?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well, I don't have no trousers on...

               She laughs. A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I know why you're here. Will don't 
                         talk much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't care what his family's like 
                         or if he doesn't have any brothers, 
                         but he doesn't have to lie to me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I really don't know what to say. 
                         Look, I lie to women all the time. 
                         That's just my way.
                              (beat)
                         Last week Morgan brought these girls 
                         down from Roslindale. I told them I 
                         was a cosmonaut. They believed me. 
                         But Will's not usually like that--

                                     MAN ON PORCH
                         Put some clothes on, Sullivan!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Take it easy father!

               She laughs.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All I can say is; I known Will a 
                         long time -- And I seen him with 
                         every girl he's ever been with. But 
                         I've never seen him like this before, 
                         ever with anyone, like how he is 
                         with you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that true?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, it is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Tom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau.

                                     TOM
                         !!! !

                                     WILL
                         !!! !

               Lambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has completed.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct. I see you used 
                         Mclullen here--

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what it's called.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --This can't be right.
                              (examining proof)
                         This is going to be very embarrassing.
                         Have you ever considered--

                                     WILL
                         I'm pretty sure it's right.

               Will gets up to leave.

                                     WILL
                              (turning back)
                         Can I ask you a favor, can we do 
                         this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I 
                         leave work to come here and the 
                         fuckin' commute is killin' me--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's fine, but did you ever think--

                                     WILL
                         It's right.
                              (a beat, heading out)
                         Take it home with you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, what happened at the Tri-tech 
                         meeting?

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. 
                         So I sent my chief negotiator.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, on your own time, you can do 
                         what you like. When I set up a 
                         meeting, with my associates, and you 
                         don't show up it reflects poorly on 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         Then don't set up any more meetings.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll cancel every meeting right now.
                         I'll give you a job myself. I just 
                         wanted you to see what was out there.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe I don't want to spend my life 
                         sittin' around and explaining shit 
                         to people.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The least you can do is show me a 
                         little appreciation.

                                     WILL
                              (indicates proof)
                         You know how fuckin' easy this is to 
                         me? This is a joke!
                              (crumples proof)
                         And I'm sorry you can't do this. I 
                         really am. 'Cause if you could I 
                         wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble 
                         around and fuck it up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sure, then you'd have more time to 
                         sit around and get drunk. Think of 
                         how many fights you could have been 
                         in by now.

               Will turns around reveling that he's lit the PROOF ON FIRE. 
               Will drops it on the floor. Lambeau drops to his knees and 
               puts it out. He looks up at Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're right, Will. I can't do that 
                         proof and you can. And when it comes 
                         to this there are only twenty people 
                         in the world that can tell the 
                         difference between you and me. But 
                         I'm one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So am I.
                              (beat)
                         Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I 
                         wish I never met you. Because then I 
                         could sleep at night. I wouldn't 
                         have to walk around with the knowledge 
                         that someone like you was out there. 
                         And I wouldn't have to watch you 
                         throw it all away.

               Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the 
               wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar lie in bed. Skylar watches Will sleep. She 
               gets up and goes to the fridge. Returning to the bed:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will? Are you awake?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come with me to California.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want you to come with me.

                                     WILL
                         How do you know that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I know. I just do.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, but how do you know?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know. I just feel it.

                                     WILL
                         And you're sure about that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah, I'm sure.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause that's a serious thing you're 
                         sayin'. I mean, we might be in 
                         California next week and you could 
                         find out somethin' about me that you 
                         don't like. And you might feel like 
                         "hey this is a big mistake."
                              (getting upset)
                         But you can't take it back, 'cause 
                         you know it's real serious and you 
                         can't take somethin' like that back. 
                         Now I'm in California, 'cause you 
                         asked me to come. But you don't really 
                         want me there. And I'm stuck in 
                         California with someone who really 
                         doesn't want me there and just wishes 
                         they had a take-back.

                                     SKYLAR
                         "Take-back?" What is that? I don't 
                         want a take-back. I want you to come 
                         to California with me.

                                     WILL
                         I can't go out to California.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         One, because I have a job here and 
                         two because I live here--

                                     SKYLAR
                              (beat)
                         Look, Will if you're not in love 
                         with me, you can say that.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Then what are you afraid of?

                                     WILL
                         What do you mean "What am I afraid 
                         of?"

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why won't you come with me? What are 
                         you so scared of?

                                     WILL
                         What am I scared of?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, what aren't you scared of?  
                         You live in your safe little world 
                         where nobody challenges you and you're 
                         scared shitless to do anything else--

                                     WILL
                         Don't tell me about my world. You're 
                         the one that's afraid. You just want 
                         to have your little fling with the 
                         guy from the other side of town and 
                         marry--

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that what you think--

                                     WILL
                         some prick from Stanford that your 
                         parents will approve of. Then you'll 
                         sit around with the rest of the upper 
                         crust kids and talk about how you 
                         went slummin' too.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I inherited that money when I was 
                         thirteen, when my father died.

                                     WILL
                         At least you have a mother.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fuck you! You think I want this? 
                         That money's a burden to me. Every 
                         day I wake up and I wish I could 
                         give that back.  I'd give everything 
                         I have back to spend one more day 
                         with my father. But that's life. And 
                         I deal with it. So don't put that 
                         shit on me. You're the one that's 
                         afraid.

                                     WILL
                         What the fuck am I afraid of?!

                                     SKYLAR
                         You're afraid of me. You're afraid 
                         that I won't love you back. And guess 
                         what?  I'm afraid too. But at least 
                         I have the balls to it give it a 
                         shot. At least I'm honest with you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not honest?

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your twelve brothers?

                                     WILL
                         Oh, is that what this is about? You 
                         want to hear that I don't really 
                         have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' 
                         orphan? Is that what you want to 
                         hear?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?

                                     WILL
                         No, you don't want to hear that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, I do, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that I got 
                         cigarettes put out on me when I was 
                         a little kid. That this isn't surgery.

               Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that. Don't 
                         tell me you want to hear that shit!!

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes I do. Did you ever think that 
                         maybe I could help you? That maybe 
                         that's the point, that we're a team?

                                     WILL
                         What, you want to come in here and 
                         save me? Is that what you want to 
                         do? Do I have a sign that says "save 
                         me" on my back?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't want to "save" you. I just 
                         want to be with you. I love you. I 
                         love you!

               Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her.

                                     WILL
                         Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' 
                         bullshit me!

                                     SKYLAR
                              (standing up to him)
                         You know what I want to hear?  I 
                         want to hear that you don't love me. 
                         If you tell me that, then I'll leave 
                         you alone. I won't ask any questions 
                         and I won't be in your life.

               A beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand.

                                     WILL
                         I don't love you.

               He walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Will leaves pulling on his clothes.

               INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and 
               ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and 
               looking sharp in twin navy blue suits.

                                     WILL
                         So why do you think I should work 
                         for the National Security Agency?

                                     DYTRESS
                         Well, you'd be working on the cutting 
                         edge. You'd be exposed to the kind 
                         of technology you couldn't see 
                         anywhere else because we've classified 
                         it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, 
                         Advanced algorithms--

                                     WILL
                         Codebreaking.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's one aspect of what we do.

                                     WILL
                         Come on, that's what you do. You 
                         handle more than eighty percent of 
                         the intelligence workload. You're 
                         seven times the size of the C.I.A.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's exactly right, Will. So the 
                         question as I see it isn't "why should 
                         you work for N.S.A." it's "why 
                         shouldn't you?"

                                     WILL
                         Why shouldn't I work for the National 
                         Security Agency? That's a tough one.

               Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHUCKIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy 
               cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both 
               boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear 
               the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE 
               emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in 
                         my mom's room again I'm gonna give 
                         you a fuckin' beatin'!

               After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced.

                                     MORGAN
                              (innocently)
                         What's up guys?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Why don't you beat off at your house?

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't have a VCR at my house.

               Will pays no attention to this exchange

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I never cared about that.

               An awkward beat.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                                     SKYLAR

                              (pause)
                         No take-backs.

               Will says nothing.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will?

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Take care.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Goodbye.

               Will hangs up. Hold on him for an agonizing beat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.

               Will can see that Lambeau wants more.

                                     WILL
                         Pudge Fisk. You follow baseball?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOGAN AIRPORT TERMINAL -- SAME

               The final boarding call is announced and the last passenger 
               boards. After a beat, Skylar turns and gets on the plane.

               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- SAME

               Will, holding the card, reflects for a beat and puts it down.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean 
                         told me. It's a long story.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         You all set?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I've got the first part. The rest I 
                         can do at home.

               Will gets up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, the N.S.A. has been calling me 
                         just about every hour. They're very 
                         excited about how the meeting went.

               Lambeau is excited. Will clearly is not.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT

               Will sits across from Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         So you might be working for Uncle 
                         Sam.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry says the meeting went well.

                                     WILL
                         I guess.

                                     SEAN
                         What did you think?

                                     WILL
                         What did I think?

               A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this.

                                     WILL
                         Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody 
                         puts a code on my desk, something 
                         nobody else can break. So I take a 
                         shot at it and maybe I break it. And 
                         I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I 
                         did my job well.  But maybe that 
                         code was the location of some rebel 
                         army in North Africa or the Middle 
                         East. Once they have that location, 
                         they bomb the village where the rebels 
                         were hiding and fifteen hundred people 
                         I never had a problem with get killed. 
                         (rapid fire) Now the politicians are 
                         sayin' "send in the Marines to secure 
                         the area" 'cause they don't give a 
                         shit. It won't be their kid over 
                         there, gettin' shot. Just like it 
                         wasn't them when their number got 
                         called, 'cause they were pullin' a 
                         tour in the National Guard. It'll be 
                         some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel 
                         in the ass.  And he comes home to 
                         find that the plant he used to work 
                         at got exported to the country he 
                         just got back from. And the guy who 
                         put the shrapnel in his ass got his 
                         old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen 
                         cents a day and no bathroom breaks. 
                         Meanwhile my buddy from Southie 
                         realizes the only reason he was over 
                         there was so we could install a 
                         government that would sell us oil at 
                         a good price. And of course the oil 
                         companies used the skirmish to scare 
                         up oil prices so they could turn a 
                         quick buck. A cute, little ancillary 
                         benefit for them but it ain't helping 
                         my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And 
                         naturally they're takin' their sweet 
                         time bringin' the oil back and maybe 
                         even took the liberty of hiring an 
                         alcoholic skipper who likes to drink 
                         seven and sevens and play slalom 
                         with the icebergs and it ain't too 
                         long 'til he hits one, spills the 
                         oil, and kills all the sea-life in 
                         the North Atlantic. So my buddy's 
                         out of work and he can't afford to 
                         drive so he's got to walk to the job 
                         interviews which sucks 'cause the 
                         shrapnel in his ass is givin' him 
                         chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile 
                         he's starvin' 'cause every time he 
                         tries to get a bite to eat the only 
                         blue-plate special they're servin' 
                         is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker 
                         State.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out 
                         for somethin' better. I figure I'll 
                         eliminate the middle man. Why not 
                         just shoot my buddy, take his job 
                         and give it to his sworn enemy, hike 
                         up gas prices, bomb a village, club 
                         a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and 
                         join the National Guard? Christ, I 
                         could be elected President.

                         Do you think you're alone?

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SEAN
                         Do you have a soul-mate?

                                     WILL
                         Define that.

                                     SEAN
                         Someone who challenges you in every 
                         way.  Who takes you places, opens 
                         things up for you. A soul-mate.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

               Sean waits.

                                     WILL
                         Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, 
                         O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant--

                                     SEAN
                         They're all dead.

                                     WILL
                         Not to me, they're not.

                                     SEAN
                         But you can't give back to them, 
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Not without a heater and some serious 
                         smelling salts, no...

                                     SEAN
                         That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll 
                         never have that kind of relationship 
                         in a world where you're afraid to 
                         take the first step because all you're 
                         seeing are the negative things that 
                         might happen ten miles down the road.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, what? You're going to take the 
                         professor's side on this?

                                     SEAN
                         Don't give me your line of shit.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't want the job.

                                     SEAN
                         It's not about that job. I'm not 
                         saying you should work for the 
                         government. But, you could do anything 
                         you want. And there are people who 
                         work their whole lives layin' brick 
                         so their kids have a chance at the 
                         kind of opportunity you have. What 
                         do you want to do?

                                     WILL
                         I didn't ask for this.

                                     SEAN
                         Nobody gets what they ask for, Will.
                         That's a cop-out.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it a cop-out? I don't see 
                         anythin' wrong with layin' brick, 
                         that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. 
                         Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's 
                         gonna get to work the next day 'cause 
                         of me. There's honor in that.

                                     SEAN
                         You're right, Will. Any man who takes 
                         a forty minute train ride so those 
                         college kids can come in in the 
                         morning and their floors will be 
                         clean and their trash cans will be 
                         empty is an honorable man.

               A beat. Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         And when they get drunk and puke in 
                         the sink, they don't have to see it 
                         the next morning because of you. 
                         That's real work, Will. And there is 
                         honor in that.  Which I'm sure is 
                         why you took the job.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         I just want to know why you decided 
                         to sneak around at night, writing on 
                         chalkboards and lying about it.
                              (beat)
                         'Cause there's no honor in that.

               Will is silent.

                                     SEAN
                         Something you want to say?

               Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

                                     SEAN
                         Why don't you come back when you 
                         have an answer for me.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SEAN
                         If you won't answer my questions, 
                         you're wasting my time.

                                     WILL
                         What?

               Will loses it, slams the door shut.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you!

               Sean has finally gotten to Will.

                                     WILL
                         Who the fuck are you to lecture me 
                         about life? You fuckin' burnout! 
                         Where's your "soul-mate?!"

               Sean lets this play out. Possible "shepard" change.

                                     WILL
                         Dead! She dies and you just cash in 
                         your chips. That's a fuckin' cop-
                         out!

                                     SEAN
                         I been there. I played my hand.

                                     WILL
                         That's right. And you fuckin' lost!  
                         And some people would have the sack 
                         to lose a big hand like that and 
                         still come back and ante up again!

                                     SEAN
                         Look at me. What do you want to do?

               A beat. Will looks up.

                                     SEAN
                         You and your bullshit. You got an 
                         answer for everybody. But I asked 
                         you a straight question and you can't 
                         give me a straight answer. Because 
                         you don't know.

               Sean goes to the door and opens it. Will walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie take crowbars to a wall. This is what they 
               do for a living. As they routinely hammer away, Will becomes 
               more involved in his battle with the wall. Plaster and lathing 
               fly as Will vents his rage. Chuckie, noticing, stops working 
               and takes a step back, watching Will. Will is oblivious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Lambeau and Tom are in his office. Will is nowhere to be 
               seen.

               Lambeau is on the phone.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What I mean, Sean, is that I'm sitting 
                         in your office and the boy isn't 
                         here.
                              (beat)
                         Well, it's ten past three.
                              (beat)
                         An hour and ten minutes late.
                              (beat)
                         Well, if he doesn't show up and I 
                         have to file a report saying he wasn't 
                         here and he goes back to jail, it 
                         won't be on my conscience, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         Fine.

               He hangs up. Tom picks up a FORM up off the desk.

                                     TOM
                         What should I do?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The boy was here. He came in, sat 
                         down and we worked together.

               A blank look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He came in, sat down, and we worked 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         Okay.

               Tom understands, begins filling out the form.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HANRAHAN'S PACKAGE STORE -- LATER

               Will walks out carrying a brown bag. He is filthy, having 
               just knocked off work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- PARKING LOT

               Chuckie is sitting on the hood of his Cadillac, watching 
               Will across the street. Chuckie is covered in grime as well. 
               Will starts walking towards Chuckie. As he draws closer, he 
               heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie 
               who handles it routinely.

               Will takes a seat next to Chuckie and they crack open their 
               beers. Other workers file out of the site. They drink.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How's the woman?

                                     WILL
                         Gone.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         She went to Medical school in 
                         California.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Sorry, brother.
                              (beat)
                         I don't know what to tell ya. You 
                         know all the girls I been with. You 
                         been with 'em too, except for Cheryl 
                         McGovern which was a big mistake on 
                         your part brother...

                                     WILL
                         Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of 
                         us has herpes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Some shows are worth the price of 
                         admission, partner.

               This gets a small laugh from Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My fuckin' back is killin' me.

               A passing SHEET METAL WORKER overhears this.

                                     SHEET METAL WORKER
                         That's why you should'a gone to 
                         college.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal 
                         pussy.
                              (beat)
                         So, when are you done with those 
                         meetin's?

                                     WILL
                         Week after I'm twenty-one.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Are they hookin' you up with a job?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, sit in a room and do long 
                         division for the next fifty years.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, but it's better than this shit. 
                         At least you'd make some nice bank.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a way outta here.

                                     WILL
                         What do I want a way outta here for?  
                         I want to live here the rest of my 
                         life. I want to be your next door 
                         neighbor. I want to take out kids to 
                         little league together up Foley Field.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, you're my best friend, so don't 
                         take this the wrong way, but in 20 
                         years, if you're livin' next door to 
                         me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin'
                         Patriots' games and still workin' 
                         construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. 
                         And that's not a threat, that's a 
                         fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what are you talkin'...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Listen, you got somethin' that none 
                         of us have.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it always this? I owe it to 
                         myself? What if I don't want to?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow 
                         I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty 
                         and I'll still be doin' this. And 
                         that's all right 'cause I'm gonna 
                         make a run at it.  But you, you're 
                         sittin' on a winning lottery ticket 
                         and you're too much of a pussy to 
                         cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause 
                         I'd do anything to have what you 
                         got! And so would any of these guys.  
                         It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if 
                         you're still here in twenty years.

                                     WILL
                         You don't know that.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let me tell you what I do know. Every 
                         day I come by to pick you up, and we 
                         go out drinkin' or whatever and we 
                         have a few laughs. But you know what 
                         the best part of my day is? The ten 
                         seconds before I knock on the door 
                         'cause I let myself think I might 
                         get there, and you'd be gone. I'd 
                         knock on the door and you wouldn't 
                         be there. You just left.

               A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Now, I don't know much. But I know 
                         that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         This is a disaster! I brought you in 
                         here to help me with this boy, not 
                         to run him out--

                         --And confuse him--

                         And here I am for the second week in 
                         a row with my professional reputation 
                         at stake--

                         Ready to falsify documents because 
                         you've given him license to walk 
                         away from this.

                                     SEAN
                         I know what I'm doing and I know why 
                         I'm here!

                         Look Sean, I don't care if you have 
                         a rapport with the boy -- I don't 
                         care if you have a few laughs -- 
                         even at my expense! But don't you 
                         dare undermine what I'm trying to do 
                         here.

                         He has a gift and with that gift 
                         comes responsibility. And you don't 
                         understand that he's at a fragile 
                         point--

                         He is at a fragile point. He's got

                         What problems does he have, Sean, 
                         that he is better off as a janitor 
                         or in jail or hanging around with--

                                     SEAN
                         Why do you think he does that, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He can handle the work, he can handle 
                         the pressure and he's obviously 
                         handled you.

                                     SEAN
                         Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor?
                         Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because 
                         the first thing that happened to him 
                         was that he was abandoned by the 
                         people who were supposed to love him 
                         the most!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, come on, Sean--

                                     SEAN
                         And why does he hang out with his 
                         friends? Because any one of those 
                         kids would come in here and take a 
                         bat to your head if he asked them 
                         to. It's called loyalty!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, that's nice--

                                     SEAN
                         And who do you think he's handling?  
                         He pushes people away before they 
                         have a chance to leave him. And for 
                         20 years he's been alone because of 
                         that. And if you try to push him 
                         into this, it's going to be the same 
                         thing all over again. And I'm not 
                         going to let that happen to him!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now don't do that. Don't you do that!
                         Don't infect him with the idea that 
                         it's okay to quit. That it's okay to 
                         be a failure, because it's not okay! 
                         If you're angry at me for being 
                         successful, for being what you could 
                         have been--

                                     SEAN
                         --I'm not angry at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. 
                         And I'm not going to apologize for 
                         any success that I've had.

                                     SEAN
                         --I don't have any anger at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you do. You're angry at me for 
                         doing what you could have done. Ask 
                         yourself if you want Will to feel 
                         that way for the rest of his life, 
                         to feel like a failure.

                                     SEAN
                         That's it. That's why I don't come 
                         to the goddamn reunions!  Because I 
                         can't stand the look in your eye 
                         when you see me! You think I'm a 
                         failure! I know who I am. I'm proud 
                         of who I am. And all of you, you 
                         think I'm some kind of pity case! 
                         You with your sycophant students 
                         following you around. And your Goddamn 
                         Medal!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is that what this is about, Sean? 
                         The Field's Medal? Do you want me to 
                         go home and get it for you? Then 
                         will you let the boy--

                                     SEAN
                         I don't want your trophy and I don't 
                         give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew 
                         you when!! You and Jack and Tom 
                         Sanders. I knew you when you were 
                         homesick and pimply-faced and didn't 
                         know what side of the bed to piss 
                         on!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right!  You were smarter than 
                         us then and you're smarter than us 
                         now! So don't blame me for how your 
                         life turned out. It's not my fault.

                                     SEAN
                         I don't blame you! It's not about 
                         that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause 
                         he's a good kid! And I won't see 
                         this happen to him- won't see you 
                         make him feel like a failure too!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He won't be a failure!

                                     SEAN
                         If you push him into something, if 
                         you ride him--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am 
                         today because I was pushed. And 
                         because I learned to push myself!

                                     SEAN
                         He's not you!

               A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns 
               to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.

                                     WILL
                         I can come back.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, that's fine, Will. I was just 
                         leaving.

               There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and 
               leaves.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm here.
                              (beat)
                         So, is that my problem? I'm afraid 
                         of being abandoned? That was easy.

                                     SEAN
                         Look, a lot of that stuff goes back 
                         a long way. And it's between me and 
                         him and it has nothing to do with 
                         you.

                                     WILL
                         Do you want to talk about it?

               Sean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk.

                                     WILL
                         What's that?

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, this is your file. I have to 
                         send it back to the Judge with my 
                         evaluation.

                                     WILL
                         You're not going to fail me are you?

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         So what's it say?

                                     SEAN
                         You want to read it?

                                     WILL
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         Have you had any experience with 
                         that?

                                     SEAN
                         Twenty years of counseling you see a 
                         lot of--

                                     WILL
                         No, have you had any experience with 
                         that?

                                     SEAN
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         It sure ain't good.

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               From a child's P.O.V. we see a man, partially obscured by a 
               doorframe. The man turns toward the P.O.V.

                                     SEAN
                              (after a pause)
                         My dad used to make us walk down to 
                         the park and collect the sticks he 
                         was going to beat us with. Actually 
                         the worst of the beatings were between 
                         me and my brother. We would practice 
                         on each other trying to find sticks 
                         that would break.

                                     WILL
                         He used to just put a belt, a stick 
                         and a wrench on the kitchen table 
                         and say "choose."

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               A large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick.

                         I used to go with the wrench.

                         Cause fuck him, that's why.

               A long quiet moment.

                         Is that why me and Skylar broke up?

                         I didn't know you had. Do you want 
                         to talk about that?
                              (beat)
                         I don't know a lot, Will. But let me 
                         tell you one thing. All this history,

               Will, who had been looking away, loos at Sean.

                         This is not your fault.

               Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will 
               sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around 
               Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this 
               image. Two lonely souls being father and son together.

               Will rides the Red Line, above ground. He looks out over the

               Will walking through South Boston. He cuts through a park. A 
               senior citizen is spearing trach for the city.

               INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Will at home. Not reading. Looks up at the ceiling.

               EXT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES -- DAY

               Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through 
               the glass doors, into the lobby.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, RECEPTION -- CONTINUOUS

               Will walks into the lobby. A SECURITY GUARD looks up.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Can I help you?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, my name is Will Hunting. I'm 
                         here about a position.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         One moment.

               The guard reaches for the phone.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO BLACK.

               FADE UP to the sound of laughter.

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- DAY

               Chuckie is again regaling Will and the guys at their table.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh my God, I got the most fucked up 
                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

                                     MORGAN
                         Save it for your mother, funny guy. 
                         We heard it before.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh, Morgan.

               They both get up, in one another's face. This is a play fight.

               "You gonna start?" "You gonna pay my hospital bills?"

                                     WILL
                         Sorry to miss this.

               INT. L STREET -- SAME

               Will comes back from the bathroom.

                                     WILL
                              (to Chuckie)
                         You and Morgan throw?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, I had to talk him down.

                                     WILL
                         Why didn't you yoke him?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, 
                         dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid, 
                         they never fight, everyone's scared 
                         of 'em. You know how many people try 
                         to whip Morgan's ass every week? 
                         Fuckin' kid won't back down.

                                     MORGAN
                              (from across the table)
                         What'd you say about me?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut the fuck up.

               Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie 
               turns to Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (To Will)
                         Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.

                                     MORGAN
                         You thought we forgot, didn't you? I 
                         know I'm gettin' my licks in.

               Laughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out 
               the door.

               EXT. L STREET -- CONTINUOUS

               As they come out the door, rather than beating Will 
               mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal 
               rendition of "Danny Boy." No one joins in.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut up, Morgan.
                              (to Will)
                         Here's your present.

               Chuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in 
               front of the bar.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, I figured now that you got 
                         your big job over in Cambridge, you 
                         needed some way to get over there 
                         and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you 
                         every day...

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

                                     MORGAN
                         No I didn't...

               Will approaches the car to take a closer look.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         But you're twenty-one now, so--

                                     BILLY
                         Yeah, now that you can drink legally, 
                         we thought the best thing to get you 
                         was a car.

               More laughter. Will inspects the Nova.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.
                              (a beat)
                         This is the ugliest fuckin' car I 
                         ever seen in my life.

               Laughter, a beat.

                                     WILL
                              (serious)
                         How the fuck did you guys do this?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Me and Bill scraped together the 
                         parts, worked on it. Morgan was out 
                         panhandlin' every day.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose 
                         fuckin' router you think sanded out 
                         all that bondo?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Guy's been up my ass for two years 
                         about a fuckin' job. I had to let 
                         him help with the car.

                                     WILL
                         So, you finally got a job Morgan?

                                     MORGAN
                         Had one, now I'm fucked again.

                                     WILL
                              (to Chuckie)
                         So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai 
                         engine under there? Can I make it 
                         back to my house?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. I re-built the engine 
                         myself.  That thing could make it to 
                         Hawaii if you wanted it to.

               Chuckie gives Will a look.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Happy 21, Will.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         Which one did you take, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs 
                         Professor Lambeau set me up with. I 
                         haven't told him yet, but I talked 
                         to my new boss over there and he 
                         seemed like a nice guy.

                                     SEAN
                         That's what you want?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I think so.

                                     SEAN
                         Good for you. Congratulations.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you.

                         So, that's it? We're done?

                                     SEAN
                         We're done. You did your time. You're 
                         a free man.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I just want you to know, Sean...

                                     SEAN
                         You're Welcome, Will.

                                     WILL
                         I'll keep in touch.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I 
                         don't know where I'll be.

               Will smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         I just... figured it's time I put my 
                         money back on the table, see what 
                         kind of cards I get.

               Will smiles. Sean hands him a piece of paper.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be checking in with my machine 
                         at the college. If you ever need 
                         anything, just call.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Do what's in your heart, son. You'll 
                         be fine.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you, Sean.

               They embrace.

                                     SEAN
                         No. Thank you.

                                     WILL
                              (re: embrace)
                         Does this violate the patient/doctor 
                         relationship?

                                     SEAN
                         Only if you grab my ass.

               They laugh.

                                     WILL
                         See ya.

                                     SEAN
                         Good luck.

               Both men smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SEAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

               Will comes out of Sean's office and sees Lambeau walking up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (surprised)
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, how you doin'?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You know, you're no longer required 
                         to come here.

                                     WILL
                         I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (a beat)
                         Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He 
                         says you start working for them next 
                         week.

               Will nods.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, that's, I think that's terrific.
                         Congratulations.

                                     WILL
                         Thank you.

                         I just want you to know... It's been 
                         a pleasure.

                                     WILL
                         Bullshit.

               They laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This job... Do it if it's what you 
                         really want.

                                     WILL
                         I appreciate that.

               A moment. Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, 
               Will turns back around.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                         Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you 
                         need some help, or you get stuck 
                         again, don't be afraid to give me a 
                         call.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (has to smile)
                         Thank you, Will. I'll do that.

               Will smiles, turns and walks away.

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean is packing his office. Lambeau opens the door.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello, Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         Come in.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean...

                                     SEAN
                              (a beat)
                         Me too.

               A moment.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So I hear you're taking some time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd 
                         travel some. Maybe write a little 
                         bit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Where're you going?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know. India maybe.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why there?

                                     SEAN
                         Never been.

               Lambeau nods.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Do you know when you'll be back?

                                     SEAN
                              (picks up a flyer 
                              from his desk)
                         I got this mailer the other day. 
                         Class of Sixty-five is having this 
                         event in six months.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I got one of those too.

                                     SEAN
                         You should come. I'll buy you a drink.

               Lambeau smiles.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean...

               A beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The drinks at those things are free.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Hell, I know that.

               Both men laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about one now?

                                     SEAN
                         Sounds good.

               They start to walk out.

                                     SEAN
                         It's on you though, until eight 
                         o'clock tonight when I win my money.

               Sean pulls out his lottery ticket. They start out down the 
               hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               On their backs as they walk down the hall.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, do you have any idea what the 
                         odds are against winning the lottery?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know... Gotta be at least 
                         four to one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

                                     SEAN
                         You're pretty quick with those 
                         numbers.  How about the odds of me 
                         buying the first round?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BANK OF THE CHARLES RIVER -- AFTERNOON

               Will sits alone, thinking. We hold on him for an extended 
               beat until he gets up and walks away.

               OMITTED

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- EARLY EVENING

               Begin final sequence.

               A wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the 
               sun is setting. The lights are on in one unit. A tighter 
               shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings 
               in cardboard boxes.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT, STREET -- SAME

               The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street, 
               where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking 
               up at Sean as he packs his things. Will's car is packed full 
               of clothes and books.

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- SAME

               Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac.

               Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat 
               open for Will.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will holds an envelope which he slips in Sean's mailbox. He 
               puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his 
               apartment who is still unaware that Will is there.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie pulls up in front of Will's house. He honks the horn, 
               waits a beat, then gets out and heads toward the house.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will drives away from Sean's house. Sean hears the car pull 
               out and looks out the window. Sean sees Will's car pulling 
               away.

               Curious, he investigates.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks up Will's front steps.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around. Seeing the 
               mailbox flag has been raised, he walks over to it.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie knocks on Will's front door. There is no answer. He 
               waits a beat, looks in the window. An incredulous smile slowly 
               starts to form.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean opens the card Will left for him. It reads:

                                     WILL
                              (in writing)
                         Sean -- If the Professor calls about 
                         that job, just tell him, "Sorry, I 
                         had to go see about a girl."

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the 
               broad smile. He knows Will is gone. He shrugs in explanation 
               to the guys. Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from 
               the curb.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               We pan up from the letter to Sean. A broad smile comes over 
               him.

               This is a look we haven't seen. Sean is truly happy.

               EXT. MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE -- SUNSET

               Will is on the road, driving away. As we pull back and credits 
               roll, the car disappears into the horizon.

                                         THE END
"GOOD WILL HUNTING"

               FADE IN:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE -- DAY

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING

               The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is 
               ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across 
               several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last 
               nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh my God, I got the most fucked up 
                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

               As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a 
               table near the back of the bar.

                                     ALL
                         Oh Jesus. Here we go.

               The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest 
               of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. 
               Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a 
               softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22, 
               heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle 
               with.

               Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other 
               guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror 
               stories with eager disgust.

               All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a 
               rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are 
               its product.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You guys know my cousin Mikey 
                         Sullivan?

                                     ALL
                         Yeah.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well you know how he loves animals 
                         right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin' 
                         home...
                              (laughs)

                                     ALL
                         What? Come on!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (trying not to laugh)
                         I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, 
                         the fuckin guy loves animals, and 
                         this is the last person you'd want 
                         this to happen to.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what the fuck happened?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Okay. He's driving along and this 
                         fuckin' cat jumps in front of his 
                         car, and so he hits this cat--

               Chuckie is really laughing now.

                                     MORGAN
                         --That isn't funny--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!"
                         And he looks in his rearview and 
                         sees this cat -- I'm sorry--

                                     BILLY
                         Fuckin' Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So he sees this cat tryin to make it 
                         across the street and it's not lookin' 
                         so good.

                                     WILL
                         It's walkin' pretty slow at this 
                         point.

                                     MORGAN
                         You guys are fuckin' sick.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So Mikey's like "Fuck, I gotta put 
                         this thing out of its misery"--So he 
                         gets a hammer--

                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
                         OH!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         out of his tool box, and starts 
                         chasin' the cat and starts whackin' 
                         it with the hammer. You know, tryin' 
                         to put the thing out of its misery.

                                     MORGAN
                         Jesus.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And all the time he's apologizin' to 
                         the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, 
                         "I'm sorry." BANG!

                                     BILLY
                         Like it can understand.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And this Samoan guy comes runnin' 
                         out of his house and he's like "What 
                         the fuck are you doing to my cat?!" 
                         Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I 
                         hit your cat with my truck, and I'm 
                         just trying to put it out of it's 
                         misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies. 
                         So Mikey's like "Why don't you come 
                         look at the front of the truck."
                         'Cause the other guy's all fuckin 
                         flipped out about--

                                     WILL
                         Watching his cat get brained.

               Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, so he's like "Check the front 
                         of my truck, I can prove I hit it 
                         'cause there's probably some blood 
                         or something"--

                                     WILL
                         --or a tail--

                                     MORGAN
                         WILL!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         And so they go around to the front 
                         of his truck... and there's another 
                         cat on the grille.

                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
                         No! Ugh!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Is that unbelievable? He brained an 
                         innocent cat!

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               The opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city 
               and the real people who live and work there, going about 
               their daily lives.

               We see a panoramic view of South Boston.

               Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare. A bed, a 
               small night table and an empty basket adorn the room. A stack 
               of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed. He is flipping 
               through a book at about a page a second.

               Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house. His Cadillac 
               idles by the curb. Will comes out and they get in the car.

               We travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown.

               Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great 
               cementdomed buildings that make up the M.I.T. campus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- DAY

               The classroom is packed with graduate students and TOM.

               PROFESSOR LAMBEAU (52) is at the lectern. The chalkboard 
               behind him is covered with theorems.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please finish McKinley by next month.

               Many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real 
               analysis. It won't hurt to brush up. I am also putting an 
               advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard--

               Everyone groans.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm hoping that one of you might 
                         prove it by the end of the semester. 
                         The first person to do so will not 
                         only be in my good graces, but go on 
                         to fame and fortune by having their 
                         accomplishment recorded and their 
                         name printed in the auspicious "M.I.T. 
                         Tech."

               Prof. Lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled "M.I.T.  
               Tech." Everyone laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Former winners include Nobel 
                         Laureates, world renowned astro-
                         physicists, Field's Medal winners 
                         and lowly M.I.T.  professors.

               More laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. That is all.

               A smattering of applause. Students pack their bags.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNLAND  LATER

               The place is a monster indoor funpark. Will, Chuckie, Morgan, 
               and Billy are in adjoining batting cages. Will has disabled 
               the pitching machine in his and pitches to Chuckie. The boys 
               have been drinking. Will throws one to Chuckie, high and 
               tight.

               Several empty beer cans sit by the cage.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Will!

               Another pitch, inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're gonna get charged!

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm afraid of you, you big 
                         fuck? You're crowdin' the plate.

               Will guns another one, way inside.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Stop brushin' me back!

                                     WILL
                         Stop crowdin the plate!

               Chuckie laughs and steps back.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. 
                         We should go there sometime.

                                     WILL
                         What are we gonna do up there?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know, we'll fuck up some 
                         smart kids.
                              (stepping back in)
                         You'd prob'ly fit right in.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

               Will fires a pitch at Chuckie's head. Chuckie dives to avoid 
               being hit. He gets up and whips his batting helmet at Will.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ROOFTOP -- EARLY AFTERNOON

               SEAN McGUIRE (52) sits, FORMALLY DRESSED, on the roof of his 
               apartment building in a beat-up lawn chair. Well-built and 
               fairly muscular, he stares blankly out over the city.

               On his lap rests an open invitation that reads "M.I.T. CLASS 
               OF '67 REUNION."

               While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is 
               a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times. This 
               is a man who fought his way through life. On his lonely stare 
               we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS LAWN -- DAY

               A thirty year REUNION PARTY has taken over the lawn. A well 
               dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that 
               reads "WELCOME BACK CLASS OF '72." We find Professor Lambeau 
               standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd. He 
               is interrupted by an approaching STUDENT.

                                     STUDENT
                         Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes.

                         I know. We just couldn't wait 'till 
                         Monday to find out.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Find out what?

                         Who proved the theorem.

               EXT. TOM FOLEY PARK, S. BOSTON -- AFTERNOON

               In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys, 
               drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The 
               boys have been here a while and it shows.

               Billy sees something that catches his interest.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's that? She's got a nice ass.

               Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a 
               beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA)

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that is a nice ass.

                         You could put a pool in that backyard.

                                     BILLY
                         Who's she talking to?

                                     MORGAN
                         That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, Bobby Champa. He used to beat 
                         the shit outta' me in Kindergarten.

                                     BILLY
                         He's a pretty big kid.

                                     WILL
                         Yah, he's the same size now as he 
                         was in Kindergarten.

                         eat...

                         What Morgan, you're not gonna go 
                         talk to her?

                         Fuck her.

               The boys get up and walk down the bleachers.

                         Roast Beef" just cause you like the 
                         take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes 
                         out of our way.

                         What else we gonna do we can't spare 
                         fifteen minutes?

                         All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell 
                         you why we're not going to "Kelly's." 
                         It's because the take-out bitch is a 
                         fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like 
                         her but she's dumb as a post and she 
                         has never got our order right, never 
                         once.

                         She's not stupid.

                                     WILL
                         She's sharp as a marble.

                         We're not goin'.
                              (beat)
                         I don't even like "Kelly's."

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the 
               hallway, carrying some papers. A group of students have 
               gathered by the chalkboard. They part like the red sea as he 
               approaches the board. Using the papers in hand, he checks 
               the proof.

               Satisfied, he turns to the class.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct? Who did this?

               Dead silence. Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Nemesh?

               Nemesh shakes his head in awe.

                                     NEMESH
                         No way.

               Lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one.

                         Well, whoever You are, I'm sure you'll 
                         find this one challenging enough to 
                         merit coming forward with your 
                         identity.  That is, if you can do 
                         it.

               INT. CHUCKIE'S CAR, DRIVING IN SOUTH BOSTON -- CONTINUOUS

               The street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway. They 
               move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down. Chuckie 
               sorts through a large "KELLY'S ROAST BEEF" BAG as he drives.

               Will holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the 
               bag.

                                     MORGAN
                              (same tone)
                         Double Burger.

               Chuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries.

                                     MORGAN
                         I, I had a Kelly's Double Burger.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Would you shut the fuck up! I know 
                         what you ordered, I was there!

                                     MORGAN
                         So why don't you give me my sandwich?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do you mean "your sandwich?" I 
                         bought it.

                                     MORGAN
                              (sarcastic)
                         Yah, all right...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How much money you got?

                                     MORGAN
                         I told you, I just got change.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well give me your fuckin' change and 
                         we'll put your fuckin' sandwich on 
                         layaway.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I think you should establish a good 
                         line of credit.

               Laughter, Chuckie goes back searching through the bag.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh motherfucker...

                                     WILL
                         She didn't do it again did she?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Jesus Christ. Not even close.

                                     MORGAN
                         Did she get my Double Burger?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!!
                         IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!

               Chuckie whips a FISH SANDWICH back to Morgan, then to Billy.

                                     WILL
                         Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone 
                         even order a Flyin' Fish?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, and we got four of 'em.

                                     BILLY
                         You gotta' be kiddin' me. Why do we 
                         even go to her?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cause fuckin' Morgan's got a crush 
                         on her, we always go there and when 
                         we get to the window he never says a 
                         fuckin' word to her, he never even 
                         gets out of the car, and she never 
                         gets our order right cause she's the 
                         goddamn MISSING LINK!

                                     WILL
                         Well, she out did herself today...

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't got a crush on her.

               Push in on Will who sees something O.S.

               Will's P.O.V. reveals BOBBY CHAMPA and his friends walking 
               down the street. One of them casually lobs a bottle into a 
               wire garbage can. It SHATTERS and some of the glass hits a 
               FEMALE PASSERBY who, although unhurt, is upset.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do we got?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know yet.

               Will's P.O.V.: The woman says something to Bobby. He says 
               something back. By the look on her face, it was something 
               unpleasant.

                                     MORGAN
                         Come on, Will...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Shut up.

                                     MORGAN
                         No, why didn't you fight him at the 
                         park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' 
                         now, I'm eatin' my snack.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         So don't go.

               Will is out of the door, jogging toward Bobby Champa. Billy 
               gets out, following Will with a look of casual indifference.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, Let's go.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.

               Leaving the car, Chuckie opens his door to follow.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (spins in his seat)
                         You're goin'. And if you're not out 
                         there in two fuckin' seconds, when 
                         I'm done with them you're next!

               And with that, Chuckie is out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK --CONTINUOUS

               Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA, calling out from 
               across the street,

                                     WILL
                              (smiling, good 
                              naturedly)
                         Hey, Bobby Champa! I went to 
                         Kindergarten with you right? Sister 
                         Margaret's class...

               Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure 
               of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby 
               might remember him, Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which 
               begins the

               FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S "LET'S GET IT ON."

               Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the 
               hapless Champa out cold.

               As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL. 
               Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two 
               exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.

               Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying 
               to avoid being overrun.

               When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he 
               HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.

               Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a 
               shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he 
               was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.

               Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will 
               can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's 
               boys from the hood of a car.

               Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a 
               fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.

               The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown 
               wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone 
               throws a bottle.

               In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's 
               friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, 
               standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING 
               him.

               ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT

               Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking 
               them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious 
               Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away.

               The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only 
               witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him.

               EXT. SIDEWALK (FULL SPEED) -- CONTINUOUS

               A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, thanks for comin' out.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, you're all invited over to 
                         Morgan's house for a complementary 
                         fish sandwich.

               The Police slam Will into the hood of a car.

                                     WILL
                              (to Police)
                         Hey, I know it's not a French cruller, 
                         but it's free.

               The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood, 
               another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car. 
               The look of rage returns to Will's eye.

                                     WILL
                         Get the fuck off me!

               Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE 
               KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a 
               fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though 
               he struggles -- takes a beating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SEAN'S ROOF -- NIGHT

               Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is 
               now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side. 
               He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out 
               of a doorway on the roof.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean?

               Sean doesn't answer.

                                     LANDLADY
                         Sean? You okay?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

               A beat.

                                     LANDLADY
                         It's getting cold.

               After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean 
               doesn't move.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               EXT. CHARLES RIVER, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE -- NEXT MORNING

               Will emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him 
               in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee. 
               He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         When's the arraignment?

                                     WILL
                         Next week.

               Chuckie pulls away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

               Students walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other, 
               students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM.

               INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

               The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. Tom 
               takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited 
               environment with mock pomposity and good humor.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is it my imagination, or has my class 
                         grown considerably?

               Laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I look around and see young people 
                         who are my students, young people 
                         who are not my students as well as 
                         some of my colleagues. And by no 
                         stretch of my imagination do I think 
                         you've all come to hear me lecture.

               More laughter.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         But rather to ascertain the identity 
                         of who our esteemed "The Tech" has 
                         come to call "The Mystery Math 
                         Magician."

               He holds up the M.I.T. Tech featuring a silhouetted figure, 
               emblazoned with a large, white question mark. The headline 
               reads "Mystery Math Magician strikes again."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Whoever you are, you've solved four 
                         of the most difficult theorems I've 
                         ever given a class. So without further 
                         ado, come forward silent rogue, and 
                         receive thy prize.

               The class waits in breathless anticipation. A STUDENT shifts 
               his weight in his chair, making a noise.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my 
                         spectators, but it appears there 
                         will be no unmasking here today. I'm 
                         going to have to ask those of you 
                         not enrolled in the class to make 
                         your escape now or, for the next 
                         three hours be subjected to the 
                         mundities of eigenvectors.

               People start to gather their things and go. Lambeau picks up 
               a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         However, my colleagues and I have 
                         conferred. There is a problem on the 
                         board, right now, that took us two 
                         years to prove. So let this be said; 
                         the gauntlet has been thrown down. 
                         But the faculty have answered the 
                         challenge and answered with vigor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

               Lambeau comes out of his office with Tom and locks the door. 
               As he turns to walk down the hallway, he stops. A faint 
               TICKING SOUND can be heard. He turns and walks down the hall.

               Lambeau and Tom come around a corner. His P.O.V. reveals a 
               figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the 
               chalkboard. There is a mop and a bucket beside him. As Lambeau 
               draws closer, reveal that the figure is Will, in his janitor's 
               uniform. There is a look of intense concentration in his 
               eyes.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me!

               Will looks up, immediately starts to shuffle off.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What're you doing?

                                     WILL
                              (walking away)
                         I'm sorry.

               Lambeau follows Will down the hall.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's your name?
                              (beat)
                         Don't you walk away from me. This is 
                         people's work, you can't graffiti 
                         here.

                                     WILL
                         Hey fuck you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (flustered)
                         Well... I'll be speaking to your 
                         supervisor.

               Will walks out. Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning 
               the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused. He stops, 
               scans the board again. Amazement registers on his face.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         My God.

               Down the hall, we hear the DOOR CLOSE. He turns to look for 
               Will, who is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW PUB, CAMBRIDGE -- THAT NIGHT

               A crowded Harvard Bar. Will and our gang walk by a line of 
               several Harvard students, waiting to be carded.

                                     MORGAN
                         What happened?
                              (beat)
                         You got fired, huh?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.

                                     MORGAN
                              (starts laughing)
                         How fuckin' retarded do you have to 
                         be to get shit-canned from that job? 
                         How hard is it to push a fuckin' 
                         broom?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You got fired from pushing a broom, 
                         you little bitch.

                                     MORGAN
                         Yah, that was different. Management 
                         was restructurin'--

                                     BILLY
                         Yah, restructurin' the amount of 
                         retards they had workin' for them.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, you fat fuck.

                                     BILLY
                         Least I work for a livin'.
                              (to Will)
                         Why'd you get fired?

                                     WILL
                         Management was restructurin'.

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My uncle can probably get you on my 
                         demo team.

                                     MORGAN
                         What the fuck? I just asked you for 
                         a job yesterday!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I told you "no" yesterday!

               After two students flash their ID's to the doorman (CASEY) 
               our boys file past him.

                                     ALL
                              (one after another)
                         What's up Case.

               With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through. A 
               fifth kid, a HARVARD STUDENT, tries to follow. He is stopped 
               by Casey's massive, outstretched arm:

                                     CASEY
                         ID?

               INT. BOW AND ARROW -- CONTINUOUS

               Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher, 
               all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, this is a Harvard bar, huh? I 
                         thought there'd be equations and 
                         shit on the wall.

               INT. BACK SECTION, BOW AND ARROW -- MOMENTS LATER

               Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have 
               made themselves comfortable. He [Chuckie] spots two ATTRACTIVE 
               YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar.

               Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair. 
               He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston 
               accent.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, how's it goin'?

                                     LYDIA
                         Fine.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So, you ladies ah, go to school here?

                                     LYDIA
                         Yes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, cause I think I had a class 
                         with you.

               At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan 
               Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate 
               themselves within listening distance. A rather large student 
               in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie. 
               He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering 
               over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's 
               attention.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What class?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Ah, history I think.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, it's not a bad school...

               At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in.

                                     CLARK
                         What class did you say that was?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         History.

                                     CLARK
                         How'd you like that course?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Good, it was all right.

                                     CLARK
                         History? Just "history?" It must 
                         have been a survey course then.

               Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy 
               exchange a look and move subtly closer.

                                     CLARK
                         Pretty broad. "History of the World?"

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Hey, come on pal we're in classes 
                         all day. That's one thing about 
                         Harvard never seizes to amaze me, 
                         everybody's talkin' about school all 
                         the time.

                                     CLARK
                         Hey, I'm the last guy to want to 
                         talk about school at the bar. But as 
                         long as you're here I want to "seize" 
                         the opportunity to ask you a question.

               Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan 
               see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..."

                                     CLARK
                         Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your 
                         history class.

               Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not.

               When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and 
               rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         To tell you the truth, I wasn't there 
                         much. The class was rather elementary.

                                     CLARK
                         Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that 
                         it was. I remember the class, it was 
                         just between recess and lunch.

               Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All right, are we gonna have a 
                         problem?

                                     CLARK
                         There's no problem. I was just hoping 
                         you could give me some insight into 
                         the evolution of the market economy 
                         in the early colonies. My contention 
                         is that prior to the Revolutionary 
                         War the economic modalities especially 
                         of the southern colonies could most 
                         aptly be characterized as agrarian 
                         precapitalist and...

               Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and 
               is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.

                                     WILL
                         Of course that's your contention. 
                         You're a first year grad student. 
                         You just finished some Marxian 
                         historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, 
                         and so naturally that's what you 
                         believe until next month when you 
                         get to James Lemon and get convinced 
                         that Virginia and Pennsylvania were 
                         strongly entrepreneurial and 
                         capitalist back in 1740. That'll 
                         last until sometime in your second 
                         year, then you'll be in here 
                         regurgitating Gordon Wood about the 
                         Pre-revolutionary utopia and the 
                         capital-forming effects of military 
                         mobilization.

                                     CLARK
                              (taken aback)
                         Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, 
                         because Wood drastically 
                         underestimates the impact of--

                                     WILL
                         "Wood drastically underestimates the 
                         impact of social distinctions 
                         predicated upon wealth, especially 
                         inherited wealth..." You got that 
                         from "Work in Essex County," Page 
                         421, right? Do you have any thoughts 
                         of your own on the subject or were 
                         you just gonna plagiarize the whole 
                         book for me?

               Clark is stunned.

                                     WILL
                         Look, don't try to pass yourself off 
                         as some kind of an intellect at the 
                         expense of my friend just to impress 
                         these girls.

               Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.

                                     WILL
                         The sad thing is, in about 50 years 
                         you might start doin' some thinkin' 
                         on your own and by then you'll realize 
                         there are only two certainties in 
                         life.

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah? What're those?

                                     WILL
                         One, don't do that.  Two -- you 
                         dropped a hundred and fifty grand on 
                         an education you coulda' picked up 
                         for a dollar fifty in late charges 
                         at the Public Library.

               Will catches Skylar's eye.

                                     CLARK
                         But I will have a degree, and you'll 
                         be serving my kids fries at a drive 
                         through on our way to a skiing trip.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         Maybe. But at least I won't be a 
                         prick.
                              (beat)
                         And if you got a problem with that, 
                         I guess we can step outside and deal 
                         with it that way.

               While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] 
               decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.

                                     WILL
                         If you change your mind, I'll be 
                         over by the bar.

               He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a 
               look.

               Morgan turns to a nearby girl.

                                     MORGAN
                         My boy's wicked smart.

               INT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER

               Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement 
               as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the 
               players shoot miniature balls at a small basket. In the B.G.  
               occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry!" When he scores.

               Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You suck.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've been sitting over there for 
                         forty-five minutes waiting for you 
                         to come talk to me. But I'm just 
                         tired now and I have to go home and 
                         I wasn't going to keep sitting there 
                         waiting for you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Skylar. And by the way. That guy 
                         over there is a real dick and I just 
                         wanted you to know he didn't come 
                         with us.

                                     WILL
                         I kind of got that impression.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get 
                         up early and waste some more money 
                         on my overpriced education.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Here's my number.

               Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to 
               Will.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe we could go out for coffee 
                         sometime?

                                     WILL
                         Great, or maybe we could go somewhere 
                         and just eat a bunch of caramels.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         When you think about it, it's just 
                         as arbitrary as drinking coffee.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughs)
                         Okay, sounds good.

               She turns.

                                     WILL
                         Five minutes.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I was trying to be smooth.
                              (indicates clock)
                         But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna 
                         come over there and talk to you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, it's my life story. Five more 
                         minutes and I would have got to hear 
                         your best pick-up line.

                                     WILL
                         The caramel thing is my pick-up line.

               A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Glad I came over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOW AND ARROW -- LATER

               Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about 
               their bar-ball exploits. Across the street is another bar 
               with a glass front. Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window 
               with some friends.

                                     MORGAN
                         There goes that fuckin' Barney right 
                         now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." 
                         We should'a kicked that dude's ass.

                                     WILL
                         Hold up.

               Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window 
               and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass. 
               He POUNDS THE GLASS to get Clark's attention.

                                     WILL
                         Hey!

               Clark turns toward Will.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?

               Clark doesn't get it.

                                     WILL
                         DO YOU LIKE APPLES?!

                                     CLARK
                         Yeah?

               Will SLAMS SKYLAR'S PHONE NUMBER against the glass.

                                     WILL
                         WELL I GOT HER NUMBER! HOW DO YA 
                         LIKE THEM APPLES?!!

               Will's boys erupt into laughter. Angle on Clark, deflated.

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car, 
               laughing together.

               EXT. CHARLES STREET BRIDGE -- DAWN

               Shot of car crossing over the Charles St. Bridge, overtaking 
               a red-line train.

               EXT. CHARLESTON BACKROAD -- DAWN

               Traveling through narrow back roads in Charlestown, passing 
               the Bunker Hill monument.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY

               Lambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores 
               lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58) 
               sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page. 
               Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in 
               the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me. Is this the buildings and 
                         grounds office?

                                     TERRY
                         Yeah, can I help you?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'm trying to find the name of a 
                         student who works here.

                                     TERRY
                         No students work for me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Could you just check, because the 
                         young man who works in my building--

                                     TERRY
                         Which one's your building?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Building two.

               Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, if something was stolen, I 
                         should know about it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no. Nothing like that. I just 
                         need his name.

                                     TERRY
                         I can't give you his name unless you 
                         have a complaint.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Please, I'm a professor here and 
                         it's very important.

                                     TERRY
                         Well, he didn't show up for work 
                         today...

               Terry takes a beat. Holding all the cards.

                                     TERRY
                         Look, he got his job through his 
                         P.O. so you can call him.

               Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a 
               card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the 
               card which reads: "PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM."

               INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

               Will stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is 
               fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will 
               and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back.

                                     WILL
                         There is a lengthy legal precedent, 
                         Your Honor, going back to 1789, 
                         whereby a defendant may claim self-
                         defense against an agent of the 
                         government where the act is shown to 
                         be a defense against tyranny, a 
                         defense of liberty--

               The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who 
                         signed the complaint isn't in my 
                         courtroom. Why is that?

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         He's in the hospital with a broken 
                         knee, Your Honor. But I have 
                         depositions from the other officers.

                                     WILL
                         Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in 
                         his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit 
                         back in 1887, that "Every American 
                         citizen is by birth, a sworn officer 
                         of the state.  Every man is a 
                         policeman." As for the other officers, 
                         even William Congrave said; "he that 
                         first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft 
                         he that has stolen the treasure."

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Your Honor--

               Will cranks it up.

                                     WILL
                              (to Prosecutor)
                         I am afforded the right to speak in 
                         my own defense by our constitution, 
                         Sir.  The same document which 
                         guarantees my right to liberty. 
                         "Liberty," in case you've forgotten,

               The Judge interrupts.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Son,

                         My turn.

               The Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                              (reading)
                         June, '93, assault, Sept. '93 
                         assault... Grand theft auto February 
                         '94.

               A beat, the Judge takes particular notice.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Where, apparently, you defended 
                         yourself and had the case thrown out 
                         by citing "free property rights of 
                         horse and carriage" from 1798...

               Lambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         March, '94 public drunkenness, public 
                         nudity, assault. 10/94 mayhem.

                         mayhem, theft, resisting -- overturned--

               The Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         You're in my courtroom, now and I am 
                         aware of your priors.
                              (beat)
                         I'm also aware that you're an orphan. 
                         You've been through several foster 
                         homes. The state removed you from 
                         three because of serious physical 
                         abuse.

               The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Another Judge might care. You hit a 
                         cop, you go in.
                              (beat)
                         Motion to dismiss denied.

               The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Keep workin' on your arguments, son. 
                         A word of advice for trial; speak 
                         English.

               As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches 
               Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, your Honor.

                         Gerald Lambeau.

               An awkward beat. Lambeau waits for some sign of recognition.

                                     LAMBEAU

               The Judge offers only a blank look.

                                     JUDGE MALONE
                         Oh. Pleased to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Do you have a minute?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GUARD walks Will down a hallway toward a group of phones.

                         One.

               The Guard gives Will a hard look for a beat. Then leaves.

                                     WILL
                         How many?

               Will picks up the phone, dials.

                                     WILL

                                     WILL
                         It's Will, the really funny good 
                         looking guy you met at the bar?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting 
                         anyone who fits that description.

                                     WILL
                         Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, 
                         obnoxious, toothless loser who got 
                         drunk and wouldn't leave you alone 
                         all night.

                         Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd 
                         call.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this 
                         week we could go to a cafe and have 
                         some caramels.

                         Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck do you want?

                         I've spoken with the judge and he's 
                         agreed to release you under my 
                         supervision.

                                     WILL
                              (suspicious)
                         Really?

                         Yes. Under two conditions.

                                     WILL
                         What're those?

                         That you meet with me twice a week
                              (a beat)
                         and you meet with a therapist.

                                     WILL
                         If I agree to this, I walk right 
                         now?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         I'll do the work. I'm not going to 
                         meet with a therapist.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, 
                         Will.
                              (beat)
                         I've already spoken to one therapist, 
                         his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a 
                         friend of mine. He's also published 
                         four books and is widely considered 
                         to be one of the brightest men in 
                         his field.

                         I'm sure it'll be better than spending 
                         the next six months in jail.

               INT. FUNLAND -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie walk up to an enclosed trampoline. Billy 
               and Morgan prefer to use it for their own version of 
               "Wrestlemania."

               As Will and Chuckie approach, Billy is on top of a bloodied 
               Morgan and has him in the "Cobra Clutch."  Will and Chuckie 
               watch for a beat. Billy tightens his grip.

                                     BILLY
                         Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!

                         Oh, Morgan!

               Chuckie turns to Will, conspiratorially as they wait for the 
               fight to finish.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What'd you get? You get leniency?

                         You're fuckin' good.

               Will smiles.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just submit, Morgan. He's got you in 
                         the Cobra Clutch.

                                     MORGAN

               INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. A closer 
               look reveals he is reading a self-help PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. Will 
               is flipping through the book at about a page per second. He 
               shakes his head and smiles. Upon finishing the book, he throws 
               it in a nearby WASTEBASKET. Push in on the back of the book 
               where a SMILING PSYCHOLOGIST is pictured.

               INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

               Will sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office. Across 
               from Will sits the same PSYCHOLOGIST, HENRY LIPKIN (40), 
               from the book. They are in mid-session.

                                     WILL
                         That's why I love stock-car racin'. 
                         That Dale Ernhart's real good.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Now you know Will, and I know, what 
                         you need to be doing. You have a 
                         gift.

                                     WILL
                         I could work the pit maybe, but I 
                         could never drive like Dale Ernhart--

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You have a quality -- something you 
                         were born with, that you have no 
                         control over -- and you are, in a 
                         sense, hiding that by becoming a 
                         janitor. And I'm not saying that's 
                         wrong. I'm friends with the janitor 
                         that works in my building.  He's 
                         been to my house for dinner. As a 
                         matter of fact I did some free 
                         consultation for "Mike" -- that's 
                         not his real name. That's in my book.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had 
                         the same problems as "Chad" the 
                         stockbroker.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Yes. The pressures you feel, and 
                         again, I am neither labeling nor 
                         judging them, are keeping you from 
                         fulfilling your potential -- you're 
                         in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- 
                         the Shenanigan's, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. I know.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Will, your not getting off that easy.

                                     WILL
                         No, but, I mean you know... I do 
                         other things. That no one knows about.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Like what, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I go places, I interact.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What places?

                                     WILL
                         Certain, clubs.
                              (beat)
                         Like, Paradise. It's not bad.

               Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look.

                                     WILL
                         It's just that feeling when you can 
                         take your shirt off and really dance.
                              (beat)
                         When the music owns you. Do you 
                         understand?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I might understand that.

                                     WILL
                         Do you find it hard to hide the fact 
                         that you're gay?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, I read your book. I talked to 
                         you. It's just something I know to 
                         be true.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         That's very presumptuous.

                                     WILL
                         Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready 
                         to give me a jump.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                              (a little laugh)
                         Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
                         but I'm married and I have two 
                         children.

                                     WILL
                         I'm sure you do. You probably got a 
                         real nice house, nice car -- your 
                         book's a best seller.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         You're getting defensive, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Look, man. I don't care if you're 
                         putting from the rough. There are 
                         solid arguments that some of the 
                         greatest people in history were gay; 
                         Alexander the Great, Caesar, 
                         Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, 
                         Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny 
                         Terrio, not many straight men can 
                         dance like that.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Who is "Danny Terrio?"

                                     WILL
                         If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your 
                         shot. Take some pride in it. You go 
                         to church? So fuckin' what, God loves 
                         you.  I mean, Christ. A guy as well 
                         known as you? By the time you put 
                         your disguise on and skulk out of 
                         the house Sunday nights you probably 
                         look like "Inspector Clouseau."

               The Psychologist calmly packs his things.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         Well, I can see this is pointless...

                                     WILL
                         You're getting defensive... Henry. 
                         And hey, chief -- tell the wife, at 
                         least.  Christ, set her free.

               The shrink gets up and walks out.

                                     WILL
                         Fuckin' hypocrite...

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of 
               Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Henry?

               The Psychologist keeps walking.

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         No. You know what, Gerry? This is 
                         why I don't do pro-bono anymore. 
                         It's not worth it to me.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What happened?

                                     PSYCHOLOGIST
                         I don't have the time. I'm going on 
                         national television this week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Henry...

               He [Henry] is out the door. Lambeau looks to Tom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will is in Lambeau's office. Lambeau is at the board, working 
               on a diagram as Tom takes notes. Will seems disinterested.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This rectangle is subdivided into 
                         rectangles. One edge of an inner 
                         rectangle is an integer. Can you 
                         prove that one edge of the larger 
                         rectangle is an integer?

                                     WILL
                         Of course.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay. How?

                                     WILL
                         It's an integer proof.

               Lambeau smiles.

                                     WILL
                         What? Hey, look buddy my time's almost 
                         up. You want me to sit here for an 
                         hour and write it out?

               Lambeau says nothing. Will gets up and goes to the board.

                                     WILL
                         Look, I'll give you the key steps to 
                         it but I'm not gonna do the whole 
                         thing.

               Lambeau keeps smiling.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be a monumental waste of 
                         time, wouldn't it, Will?

                                     WILL
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I happen to know so.

               Lambeau rises and goes to the board.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're thinking too hard. What if I 
                         did this?

               He draws a vertical line through the diagram.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now, what if I do this?

               He draws a horizontal line through the diagram. He hands 
               Will the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you ever played checkers?

               Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he starts 
               drawing lines through the diagram, energized.

                                     WILL
                         You color-code it. Half-red, half-
                         black.  If that's an integer--

               Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's that?

                                     WILL
                         Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --that?--

                                     WILL
                         --Half-red, half-black--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --That edge!

                                     WILL
                         An integer.

               The two stop. They are silent for a moment. Like two 
               gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (checks his watch)
                         It would appear we got that proof in 
                         under the wire after all. It's not 
                         how hard you look at things, young 
                         man, it's the way you look at them. 
                         If you take aim before you fire, you 
                         will find the most difficult problems 
                         become, quite literally, child's 
                         play.

               Will gets his coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, you've managed to offend four 
                         of my colleagues so much that they 
                         refused to come back. You're meeting 
                         with the leading hypnotist in the 
                         country next week and Tom and I plan 
                         to sit in on the sessions, so I expect 
                         you to behave appropriately.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits in a chair across from Lambeau and the HYPNOTIST.

               Lambeau's assistant, TOM (33) takes notes. The Hypnotist 
               makes small talk with Lambeau, who checks his watch.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Shall we start the, uh...

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You 
                         guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Yes, Will. We'll get to that. But 
                         first, why don't you go to sleep for 
                         me.

               He SNAPS HIS FINGERS and instantly Will's head goes BACK and 
               his EYES CLOSE. The Hypnotist gives Lambeau a look.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Would you mind standing on one leg?

               Will gets up and stands on one leg. Lambeau is impressed.

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER

               Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The 
               mood is more serious now.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now 
                         how old are you?

                                     WILL
                         Seven.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         And what do you see?

                                     WILL
                         Somethin's in my room.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         What is it?

                                     WILL
                         It's like a small figure, hoverin' 
                         over me. Gettin' closer.

               Will flinches.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You're in a safe place, Will.

                                     WILL
                         It's touching me.

               Lambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau] 
               with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         Where is it touching you?

                                     WILL
                         Down there.
                              (indicating genitals)
                         And I'm nervous.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         You don't have to be nervous, Will.

               Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause I'm not ready.
                              (calming)
                         But the figure tells me everything's 
                         gonna be all right. 'Cause the 
                         figure's a Libra too. And we start 
                         dancin' and it's beautiful--

               Will breaks into song at full volume.

                                     WILL
                         "SKY ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!"

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (getting up)
                         Oh Jesus.

               The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door. 
               Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets."

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Wait a minute, Barry.

                                     HYPNOTIST
                         I have better ways to spend my time.

               He is gone. Will stops singing, laughs.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, for God's sake, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this 
                         one on me. He left, I wanted to talk 
                         to him for another twenty minutes. I 
                         was havin' fun.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I told you to cooperate with these 
                         people.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece 
                         of work.

               Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of 
               Lambeau.

                                     WILL
                              (spooky voice)
                         Look into my eyes. I don't need 
                         therapy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Get out, Will.

                                     WILL
                         Okay... don't forget to get another 
                         therapist for next week.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's enough.

               Will is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom.

                                     TOM
                         I called Mel Weintraub this morning, 
                         to check for availability.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What's the point?

                                     TOM
                         What do you want to do?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         There is somebody...

                                     TOM
                         Who is he?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was my roommate in college.

               INT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY

               This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class. 
               Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall 
               could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here 
               today.

               Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired 
               of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the 
               tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student 
               body.

                                     SEAN
                         Establishing trust is the most 
                         important component in making 
                         breakthroughs with a patient. Why?

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         Maureen?

               MAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare.

                                     SEAN
                         Keep up the good work, Maureen. 
                         Vinnie?

               VINNIE looks up.

                                     VINNIE
                         Because trust is an important thing.

                                     SEAN
                         Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't 
                         your brother give you the notes? 
                         Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you 
                         then they won't feel safe enough to 
                         be honest with you -- then there's 
                         no point to them being in therapy. 
                         It's like saying -- "Fine, come here 
                         and don't tell me a thing but go 
                         home feeling like you're doing 
                         something about your problems -- and 
                         give me my fifty bucks before you 
                         leave will ya'!"

               He looks around the room for approval. No one is listening.

                                     SEAN
                         If you don't help them trust you -- 
                         then there's no way you'll ever get 
                         them to sleep with you. And that 
                         should be the goal of any good 
                         therapist. Insecure women, you know... 
                         nail 'em when they're vulnerable, 
                         that's always been my motto.

               The students look up, somewhat stunned.

                                     SEAN
                         See, I got Vinnie's attention.

               Laughter. Sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices 
               LAMBEAU standing in the back of the room. There is an awkward 
               moment.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry.

                         Sean.

                                     SEAN
                              (to class)
                         Well, it seems we're in the presence 
                         of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau 
                         is a Field's Medal winner. 
                         Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.

               The students stare blankly.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello.

                                     SEAN
                         The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize 
                         for math.
                              (beat)
                         But it's only given out every four 
                         years.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         Okay, that's all for today. Try and 
                         get through Fernald by Monday.

               The class starts to pack up and file out. Lambeau approaches 
               Sean who steps down from the lectern.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Good to see you.

                                     SEAN
                         Good to see you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is there someplace we can talk?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar on their first date. They watch a street 
               MAGICIAN doing tricks with a rabbit. The guy's tricks are 
               pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work. 
               He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit, 
               the rabbit really does the tricks." Will gives Skylar a look 
               and they move on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOY STORE -- LATER

               Will and Skylar walk into the small shop.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know, it was just kind of 
                         the boring suburban thing. Private 
                         school, Harvard, and now Med. School.
                              (Beat)
                         I actually figured out that at the 
                         end of it, my brain will be worth a 
                         quarter of a million dollars. I 
                         shouldn't have told you that...

                                     WILL
                         I bet your parents were happy to 
                         pay.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I was happy to pay. I inherited the 
                         money.

                                     WILL
                         Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Stanford. I'm leaving in June after 
                         I graduate.

                                     WILL
                         So you just want to use me and go?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, I'm gonna experiment on you 
                         for my anatomy class, then go.

                                     WILL
                         In that case, fine.
                              (beat)
                         Want to see my magic trick?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Sure.

               Will, pulls out a bulging HANDFUL OF CARAMELS.

                                     WILL
                         Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels 
                         disappear.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay...

               Will goes into all manner of hocus-pocus theatrics. Then 
               shakes his hand wildly. The trick doesn't pan out and the 
               caramels go flying all over the store. Skylar laughs.

                                     WILL
                         It works better when I have my rabbit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

               Lambeau and Sean share a table at this exclusive restaurant.

               Sean seems slightly out of place in his wrinkled sport coat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I didn't see you at the reunion.

                                     SEAN
                         I've been busy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You were missed.

                         How long has it been since we've

                         Since Nancy died.

                         I'm sorry, that damn conference--

                         I got your card.

               INT. HARVARD SQ. DINER: "THE TASTY" -- NIGHT

               A FRY COOK hands Will and Skylar a pair of CHEESEBURGERS.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Have you ever seen Annie Hall?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, there's this part of the movie 
                         that's about how there's always this 
                         tension on a first date where both 
                         people are thinking about what's 
                         going to happen with the whole 'good 
                         night kiss' thing.

               Will smiles.

                                     WILL
                         I really don't 'date' that much.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughs)
                         You know what I mean. I know you've 
                         at least thought about it.

                                     WILL
                         No I haven't...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes you have. You were thinking you 
                         were gonna get a good night kiss.

                                     WILL
                              (mock protest)
                         No I wasn't...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes you were.

                                     WILL
                         I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good 
                         night laid" but... I'll take a kiss.

               She laughs.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Oh, you will?

                                     WILL
                         No... I was hoping to get a kiss.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Then why don't we just get it out of 
                         the way.

               He looks at her.

                                     WILL
                         Now?

               Both of them have cheeseburger in their mouths.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah.

               They kiss, mouths full of burger. It's nice. A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         That had to be the worst good night 
                         kiss...

               Will laughs.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, look lady, I'm just here for 
                         the free food.

               She smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Free?

                                     WILL
                         Hey, I spent all my money on those 
                         caramels.

               She laughs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- SAME

               Lambeau and Sean, having finished their meal. Lambeau has 
               been pitching Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full 
                         schedule.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This kid's special, Sean. I've never 
                         seen anything like him.

                                     SEAN
                         Not much free time, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you ever heard of a man named 
                         Ramanujan?

               Sean nods his head.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He was alive over a hundred years 
                         ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not 
                         feathers...

               Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny 
                         hut in India. No formal education, 
                         no access to other works. But he 
                         came across an old math book and 
                         from this basic text he was able to 
                         extrapolate theories that had baffled 
                         mathematicians for years.

                                     SEAN
                         And he mailed it to Hardy--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right, Sean. He mailed it to 
                         a professor at Cambridge who 
                         immediately recognized the brilliance 
                         in his work and brought Ramanujan to 
                         England.

                                     SEAN
                         Where he contracted pneumonia and 
                         died at a young age--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         They worked together for the remainder 
                         of their lives, producing some of 
                         the most exciting math theory ever 
                         done.  Ramanujan's genius was 
                         unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like 
                         that. But he's very defensive and I 
                         need someone who can get through to 
                         him.

                                     SEAN
                         Why me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I need someone with your kind of 
                         background.

                                     SEAN
                         My kind of background?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're from the same neighborhood. 
                         South Boston.

                                     SEAN
                         He's from Southie? How many people 
                         did you try before you came to me?

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (looks squarely at 
                              Sean)
                         Five.

               Sean gives a slight, knowing smile.

                                     SEAN
                         Who? Barry, Henry, Rick...

               Lambeau nods.

                                     SEAN
                         Not Rick? You didn't send him to 
                         Rick?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Just meet with the boy once a week.

                                     SEAN
                         Can we do it at my office?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That would be fine.

               The waiter comes with the CHECK. Each man reaches for it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, please.

                                     SEAN
                         I got it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's on the college.

               Sean relents.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- MORNING

               Establishing shot of the red-brick campus. Planes land at 
               nearby Logan airport. Will walks up the steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean's office is comfortable. Books are stacked against the 
               wall. There is a PAINTING on the wall behind Sean. Sean is 
               seated behind a desk. Lambeau sits in a chair in the back of 
               the room, next to Tom. A long beat passes, they wait.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Any vulnerability he senses, he'll 
                         exploit.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be okay.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         It's a poker game with this young 
                         man.  Don't let him see what you've 
                         got.

               Sean nods. Will walks in. Everyone stands to greet Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello, Will. Any trouble finding the 
                         place?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, 
                         Will Hunting.

               Sean and Will nod. An awkward moment as the four men stand.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, let's get started.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, let's let the healing begin.

               Lambeau is slightly embarrassed. Sean smiles at Will's joke.

                                     SEAN
                         Would you excuse us?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Tom.

                                     SEAN
                         You too, Gerry.

               Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering.

               After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will 
               alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He 
               seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence 
               as Sean watches Will.

                                     SEAN
                         Hello, Will. I'm Sean Maguire.

               A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and 
               sits.

               He lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally-

                                     SEAN
                         Where are you from in Southie?

                                     WILL
                         Did you buy all these books retail, 
                         or do you send away for like a "shrink 
                         kit" that comes with all these volumes 
                         included?

                                     SEAN
                         Have you read all these books, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Probably not.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating a shelf)
                         How about the ones on that shelf?

               Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I read those.

                                     SEAN
                         What did you think?

                                     WILL
                         I'm not here for a fuckin' book 
                         report.  They're your books, why 
                         don't you read 'em?

                                     SEAN
                         I did.

                                     WILL
                         That must have taken you a long time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah, it did take me a long time.

               Sean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident 
               manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair 
               and goes to the shelf.

                                     WILL
                              (looking at book)
                         "A History of the United States, 
                         Volume I." If you want to read a 
                         real history book, read Howard Zinn's 
                         "A People's History of the United 
                         States." That book will knock you on 
                         your ass.

                                     SEAN
                         How about Noam Chomsky's 
                         "Manufacturing Consent?"

                                     WILL
                         You people baffle me. You spend all 
                         this money on beautiful, fancy books-- 
                         and they're the wrong fuckin' books.

                                     SEAN
                         You think so?

                                     WILL
                         Whatever blows your hair back.

               Will returns to his chair. Pause.

                                     SEAN
                              (indicating cigarette)
                         Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much.

                                     WILL
                         You're right. It really gets in the 
                         way of my jazzercizing.

               Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He 
               remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his 
               face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence.

                                     WILL
                         Do you lift?

                                     SEAN
                         Yes, I do.

                                     WILL
                         Nautilus?

                                     SEAN
                         Free weights.

                                     WILL
                         Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?

                                     SEAN
                         285. 

                                     WILL
                         Oh.

               Will gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's 
               painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous 
               storm -- by no means a masterpiece. Will studies it.

                                     WILL
                         You paint this?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Do you paint?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         Crayons?

                                     WILL
                         This is a real piece of shit.

                                     SEAN
                         Tell me what you really think.

                                     WILL
                         Poor color composition, lousy use of 
                         space. But that shit doesn't really 
                         concern me.

                                     SEAN
                         What does?

                                     WILL
                         The color here, see how dark it is? 
                         It's interesting.

                                     SEAN
                         What is?

                                     WILL
                         I think you're one step away from 
                         cutting your ear off.

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?

                                     WILL
                         You ever heard the saying, "any port 
                         in a storm?"

                                     SEAN
                         Sure, how 'bout "still waters run 
                         deep"-

                                     WILL
                         --Well, maybe that means you.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe what mea--

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you were in the middle of a 
                         storm, a big fuckin' storm -- the 
                         waves were crashing over the bow, 
                         the Goddamned mast was about to snap, 
                         and you were crying for the harbor. 
                         So you did what you had to do, to 
                         get out.  Maybe you became a 
                         psychologist.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe you should be a patient and 
                         sit down.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe you married the wrong woman.

                                     SEAN
                         Watch your mouth.

                                     WILL
                         That's it isn't it? You married the 
                         wrong woman. She leave you? Was she 
                         bangin' someone else?

               Sean is walking slowly towards Will.

                                     WILL
                         How are the seas now, D--

               In a flash, Sean has Will by the throat. Will is helpless.

                                     SEAN
                         If you ever disrespect my wife 
                         again... I will end you.

                                     WILL
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               Will walks out of Sean's office past Lambeau and Tom who are 
               sitting in the hallway.

                                     WILL
                         At ease, gentlemen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean stands behind his desk in his office, still very much 
               on edge. Lambeau walks in.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Five minutes, Sean. Are you okay?

               A pause, Sean is staring at his painting.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll understand if you don't want to 
                         meet with him again.

                                     SEAN
                         Thursday, four o'clock. Make sure 
                         the kid is here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WONDERLAND RACETRACK -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run. 
               They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and 
               America.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You grew up around here?

                                     WILL
                         Not far from here, South Boston.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How was that?

                                     WILL
                         Pretty boring, I guess.

               She smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I bet you have a great family.

                                     WILL
                         You know, nothing special.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     WILL
                         Do I have a lot of brothers and 
                         sisters?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         Well, Irish Catholic. What do you 
                         think?

                                     SKYLAR
                         How many?

                                     WILL
                         You wouldn't believe me if I told 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What, five?

               Will shakes his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Seven?

               Will shakes his head. Smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come on.

                                     WILL
                         I have twelve big brothers.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Not a chance.

                                     WILL
                         Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Bullshit.

                                     WILL
                         I swear to God.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Your house must have been a zoo.

                                     WILL
                         It was great. There was always someone 
                         to play with, give you advice.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Do you know all their names?

                                     WILL
                         'Course I do, they're my brothers.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well...

                                     WILL
                         Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, 
                         Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, 
                         Johnny, and Brian.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (laughing)
                         Do you keep in touch with them?

                                     WILL
                         All the time. We all live in Southie. 
                         I live with three of them now.

               Skylar smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want to meet them.

                                     WILL
                         We'll do that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               As we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn 
               with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes. Although, if 
               it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare. 
               A framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover featuring a screaming Larry 
               Bird and entitled "CELTIC PRIDE" hangs on the wall. Sean 
               sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of 
               BUSHMILL'S IRISH WHISKEY. He is deep in thought.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will strolls into the office. Sean is waiting there behind 
               his desk. He seems different. More calm. Will and Sean stare 
               at each other for a long moment.

                                     WILL
                         You again. How the paintin' coming?

               Sean stands up.

                                     SEAN
                         Come with me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER

               Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.

               They look out over a small pond, in which a group of 
               schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.

                                     WILL
                         So what's with this place? You have 
                         a swan fetish? Is this something 
                         you'd like to talk about?

                                     SEAN
                         I was thinking about what you said 
                         to me the other day, about my 
                         painting. I stayed up half the night 
                         thinking about it and then something 
                         occurred to me and I fell into a 
                         deep peaceful sleep and haven't 
                         thought about you since. You know 
                         what occurred to me?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         You're just a boy. You don't have 
                         the faintest idea what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     WILL
                         Why thank you.

                                     SEAN
                         You've never been out of Boston.

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                         So if I asked you about art you could 
                         give me the skinny on every art book 
                         ever written... Michelangelo? You 
                         know a lot about him I bet. Life's 
                         work, criticisms, political 
                         aspirations. But you couldn't tell 
                         me what it smells like in the Sistine 
                         Chapel. You've never stood there and 
                         looked up at that beautiful ceiling. 
                         And if I asked you about women I'm 
                         sure you could give me a syllabus of 
                         your personal favorites, and maybe 
                         you've been laid a few times too.
                         But you couldn't tell me how it feels 
                         to wake up next to a woman and be 
                         truly happy. If I asked you about 
                         war you could refer me to a bevy of 
                         fictional and non-fictional material, 
                         but you've never been in one. You've 
                         never held your best friend's head 
                         in your lap and watched him draw his 
                         last breath, looking to you for help. 
                         And if I asked you about love I'd 
                         get a sonnet, but you've never looked 
                         at a woman and been truly vulnerable. 
                         Known that someone could kill you 
                         with a look. That someone could rescue 
                         you from grief. That God had put an 
                         angel on Earth just for you.  And 
                         you wouldn't know how it felt to be 
                         her angel. To have the love be there 
                         for her forever. Through anything, 
                         through cancer. You wouldn't know 
                         about sleeping sitting up in a 
                         hospital room for two months holding 
                         her hand and not leaving because the 
                         doctors could see in your eyes that 
                         the term "visiting hours" didn't 
                         apply to you. And you wouldn't know 
                         about real loss, because that only 
                         occurs when you lose something you 
                         love more than yourself, and you've 
                         never dared to love anything that 
                         much. I look at you and I don't see 
                         an intelligent confident man, I don't 
                         see a peer, and I don't see my equal. 
                         I see a boy. Nobody could possibly 
                         understand you, right Will? Yet you 
                         presume to know so much about me 
                         because of a painting you saw.  You 
                         must know everything about me.  You're 
                         an orphan, right?

               Will nods quietly.

                                     SEAN
                         Do you think I would presume to know 
                         the first thing about who you are 
                         because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I 
                         don't buy the argument that you don't 
                         want to be here, because I think you 
                         like all the attention you're getting. 
                         Personally, I don't care. There's 
                         nothing you can tell me that I can't 
                         read somewhere else.  Unless we talk 
                         about your life. But you won't do 
                         that. Maybe you're afraid of what 
                         you might say.

               Sean stands,

                                     SEAN
                         It's up to you.

               And walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie doing demo at the site. They throw 
               cinderblocks out a window into a pile. They are filthy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- NIGHT

               Rain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac 
               fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the 
               back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone.

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hello?

               Will hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Who'd you call?

                                     WILL
                         No one. I didn't have the number.

                                     MORGAN
                         What are you, retarded? You went all 
                         the way out there in the rain and 
                         you didn't have the number?

                                     WILL
                         No, it was your mother's 900 number. 
                         I just ran out of quarters.

               Laughter. Chuckie pulls away from the curb.

                                     MORGAN
                         Why don't we get off mothers, I just 
                         got off yours.

               There is a long moment of silence in response to Morgan's 
               attempt at levity. Then laughter.

                                     BILLY
                         You're a pretty funny guy. Here, 
                         have a nickel.

               Billy WHIPS his EMPTY BEER CAN off of Morgan's head.

                                     MORGAN
                         Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what 
                         happens.

                                     BILLY
                         All right, then.

                                     MORGAN
                         Watch what happens.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from Sean completely silent and takes out a 
               pack of cigarettes.

                                     SEAN
                         No smoking.

               Will puts the cigarettes away. Sean stares at Will and 
               occasionally at the clock. Sean continues to check the clock 
               on the wall. It is the only clock in the room and it is BEHIND 
               Will. Their hour is almost up.

               CLOSE ON: WILL'S EYES INTERCUT WITH THE CLOCK.

               He is counting seconds. As the second hand crosses the twelve, 
               Will stands up and walks out, leaving Sean alone.

               INT. HALLWAY -- LATER

               Lambeau and Sean walk down the hallway after the session.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What do you mean "he didn't talk?" 
                         You sat there for an hour?

                                     SEAN
                         No, he just sat there and counted 
                         the seconds until the session was 
                         over. It was pretty impressive, 
                         actually.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why would he do that?

                                     SEAN
                         To show me he doesn't have to talk 
                         to me if he doesn't want to.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring 
                         contest between two kids from the 
                         "old neighborhood?"

                                     SEAN
                         I won't talk first.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- EVENING

               Chuckie drops Will off at his apartment, watches him [Will] 
               walk up the steps.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

               Chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to Will's 
               front door. After a beat, Will emerges. They get back in 
               [the car].

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie at work. Chuckie shows Will how to be a 
               man.

               INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- NIGHT

               The bar is a bit more crowded than usual. Will and Chuckie 
               walk back to their table, carrying beers. They pass a table 
               of GIRLS, local regulars getting just as bombed as the guys. 
               These girls are a little overdone. Too much make-up, too 
               much hairspray, and too much body for such tight outfits. 
               One of the girls, KRYSTYN, smiles at Will who seems subdued.

                                     KRYSTYN
                         Hi, Will.

                                     WILL
                         How you doin', Krystyn.

               They pass the table of girls. Chuckie looks at one, ruefully.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I didn't get on Cathy last night.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I don't know.

               Chuckie turns back to one of the girls, calling out:

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Cathy! Why didn't you give me none 
                         of your twat last night?

               A girl at the table, CATHY, holds up her PINKY FINGER and 
               smiles -- revealing a mouthful of MISSING TEETH.

                                     CATHY
                         Fuck you and your Irish curse, 
                         Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She's missin' teeth, Will.

               Will nods, not really into it tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Plus, it's like, five to two Morgan 
                         ends up marryin' her. There's only 
                         so many times you can bang your 
                         friend's future wife...

               They get to the table. Will's heart just isn't in it.

                                     WILL
                         I'm takin' off.

                                     ALL
                         We're goin' late night.

                                     WILL
                         I'm tired.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Lambeau work together at the board. They communicate 
               non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a 
               particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look 
               and laugh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean 
               casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restlessly 
               looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half 
               smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment:

                                     WILL
                         You know, I was on this plane once. 
                         And I'm sittin' there and the captain 
                         comes on and is like "we'll be 
                         cruising at 35,000 feet," and does 
                         his thing, then he puts the mike 
                         down but forgets to turn it off. 
                         Then he says "man, all I want right 
                         now is a blow-job and a cup of 
                         coffee."  So the stewardess goes 
                         runnin' up towards the cock-pit to 
                         tell him the mike's still on, and 
                         this guy in the back of the plane 
                         goes "don't forget the coffee!"

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         You've never been on a plane.

                                     WILL
                         I know, but the joke's better if I 
                         tell it in the first person.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I have been laid you know.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah? You got a lady now?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I went on a date last week.

                                     SEAN
                         How'd it go?

                                     WILL
                         Fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, are you going out again?

                                     WILL
                         I don't know.

                                     SEAN
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         Haven't called her.

                                     SEAN
                         Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.

                                     WILL
                         I know what I'm doing. She's different 
                         from the other girls I met. We have 
                         a really good time. She's smart, 
                         beautiful, fun...

                                     SEAN
                         So Christ, call her up.

                                     WILL
                         Why? So I can realize she's not so 
                         smart. That she's boring. You don't 
                         get it. Right now she's perfect, I 
                         don't want to ruin that.

                                     SEAN
                         And right now you're perfect too. 
                         Maybe you don't want to ruin that.

               Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         Well, I think that's a great 
                         philosophy Will, that way you can go 
                         through your entire life without 
                         ever having to really know anybody.

               Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife used to turn the alarm clock 
                         off in her sleep. I was late for 
                         work all the time because in the 
                         middle of the night she'd roll over 
                         and turn the damn thing off. 
                         Eventually I got a second clock and 
                         put it under my side of the bed, but 
                         it got to where she was gettin' to 
                         that one too. She was afraid of the 
                         dark, so the closet light was on all 
                         night. Thing kept me up half the 
                         night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, 
                         out of sheer exhaustion and not wake 
                         up when I was supposed to cause she'd 
                         have already gotten to my alarms.

               Will smiles, Sean takes a beat.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's been dead two years, Will. 
                         And when I think about her, those 
                         are the things I think about most. 
                         Little idiosyncrasies that only I 
                         knew about.  Those made her my wife. 
                         And she had the goods on me too. 
                         Little things I do out of habit. 
                         People call these things imperfections 
                         Will. It's just who we are. And we 
                         get to choose who we're going to let 
                         into out weird little worlds. You're 
                         not perfect. And let me save you the 
                         suspense, this girl you met isn't 
                         either. The question is, whether or 
                         not you're perfect for each other.  
                         You can know everything in the world, 
                         but the only way you're findin' that 
                         one out is by giving it a shot. You 
                         sure won't get the answer from an 
                         old fucker like me. And even if I 
                         did know, I wouldn't tell you.

               Will smiles. A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Why not? You told me every other 
                         fuckin' thing. You talk more than 
                         any shrink I ever met.

               Sean laughs.

                                     SEAN
                         I teach this shit, I didn't say I 
                         knew how to do it.

                                     WILL
                         You ever think about gettin' 
                         remarried?

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Hence, the word remarried.

                                     SEAN
                         My wife's dead.

                                     WILL
                         Well I think that's a wonderful 
                         philosophy, Sean. That way you can 
                         go through the rest of your life 
                         without having to really know anyone.

               A beat. Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Time's up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               Will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out -- 
               so he can go in.

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

               The door to Skylar's dorm is partially open. Will stands 
               outside while Skylar remains on the threshold.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Where have you been?

                                     WILL
                         I'm sorry, I been real busy.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You were busy? You know, I really 
                         was waiting for you to call me.

                                     WILL
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another 
                         crack at it. Let me take you out.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You should have called. I have an "O-
                         chem" lab due tomorrow and it's 
                         impossible.
                              (beat)
                         It's not an excuse dummy. I want to 
                         go out with you. But look:

               She holds up her Lab. Will glances at it.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Tomorrow?

                                     WILL
                         Promise?

                                     SKYLAR
                         If you bring the caramels.

               Will smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- LATER

               Will sits in an outdoor cafe, thinking. After a beat, he 
               leans over to two students working at a nearby table, borrows 
               a pen and paper and starts writing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               Will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn. He stops 
               at Skylar's dorm and knocks on the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

               She emerges. He hands her the paper he was working on. It is 
               her O-chem lab.

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How the hell did you do that?

                                     WILL
                         Didn't your mother ever tell you not 
                         to look a gift horse in the mouth?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I'm supposed to understand this.

                                     WILL
                         You're not going into surgery tomorrow 
                         are you?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         Then let's go have some fun.

               With a smile, she relents.

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean and Will in session.

                                     SEAN
                         Really? How'd the date go?

                                     WILL
                         Do you still counsel veterans?
                              (beat)
                         I read your book last night.

                                     SEAN
                         No, I don't.

                                     WILL
                         Why not?

                                     SEAN
                         I gave that up when my wife got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Is that why you didn't write anything 
                         else?

                                     SEAN
                              (smiles)
                         I didn't write anything else 'cause 
                         nobody, including most of my 
                         colleagues bothered to read the first 
                         one.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I've read you colleagues. Your 
                         book was good, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         All those guys were in your platoon?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     WILL
                         What happened to that guy from 
                         Kentucky?

                                     SEAN
                         Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I 
                         kind of lost touch with him after 
                         Nancy got sick.

                                     WILL
                         Do you ever wonder what your life 
                         would be like if you never met your 
                         wife?

                                     SEAN
                         What? Do I wonder if I'd be better 
                         off if I never met my wife?

               Will starts to clarify his question.

                                     SEAN
                         No, that's okay. It's an important 
                         question. 'Cause you'll have your 
                         bad times, which wake you up to the 
                         good stuff you weren't paying 
                         attention to.  And you can fail, as 
                         long as you're trying hard. But 
                         there's nothing worse than regret.

                                     WILL
                         You don't regret meetin' your wife?

                                     SEAN
                         Why? Because of the pain I feel now? 
                         I have regrets Will, but I don't 
                         regret a singel day I spent with 
                         her.

                                     WILL
                         When did you know she was the one?

                                     SEAN
                         October 21, 1975. Game six of the 
                         World Series. Biggest game in Red 
                         Sox history, Me and my friends slept 
                         out on the sidewalk all night to get 
                         tickets. We were sitting in a bar 
                         waiting for the game to start and in 
                         walks this girl.  What a game that 
                         was. Tie game in the bottom of the 
                         tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, 
                         hit a long fly ball down the left 
                         field line. Thirty-five thousand 
                         fans on their feet, screamin' at the 
                         ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' 
                         up the baseline, wavin' at the ball 
                         like a madman. It hits the foul pole, 
                         home run. Thirty-five thousand people 
                         went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Where were you?

                                     SEAN
                         I was havin' a drink with my future 
                         wife.

                                     WILL
                         You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to 
                         have a drink with a woman you had 
                         never met?

                                     SEAN
                         That's right.

                                     WILL
                         So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't 
                         won a World Series since nineteen 
                         eighteen, you slept out for tickets, 
                         games gonna start in twenty minutes, 
                         in walks a girl you never seen before, 
                         and you give your ticket away?

                                     SEAN
                         You should have seen this girl. She 
                         lit up the room.

                                     WILL
                         I don't care if Helen of Troy walked 
                         into that bar! That's game six of 
                         the World Series!

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         And what kind of friends are these? 
                         They let you get away with that?

                                     SEAN
                         I just slid my ticket across the 
                         table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta 
                         go see about a girl."

                                     WILL
                         "I gotta go see about a girl"? What 
                         did they say?

                                     SEAN
                         They could see that I meant it.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     SEAN
                         No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I 
                         had gone to see that game I'd be in 
                         here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a 
                         bar twenty years ago. And how I always 
                         regretted not goin' over there and 
                         talkin' to her. I don't regret the 
                         eighteen years we were married. I 
                         don't regret givin' up counseling 
                         for six years when she got sick. I 
                         don't regret being by her side for 
                         the last two years when things got 
                         real bad. And I sure as Hell don't 
                         regret missing that damn game.

               A beat. Will is impressed.

                                     WILL
                         Would have been nice to catch that 
                         game though.

                                     SEAN
                              (breaking)
                         Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was 
                         gonna hit the home run.

               They laugh.

                                                          TIME DISSOLVE TO:

               INT LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               The office is more crowded than usual. TOM and THREE of 
               LAMBEAU'S COLLEAGUES including the esteemed ALEXANDER PEKEC 
               are in the room. Will sits at a work-station which projects 
               a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard. Lambeau stands 
               beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec, 
               a foreign mathematician. The image is of a Ramses graph binary 
               tree.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, I know your theory. The 
                         boy is updating, he's strategy 
                         stealing...

                                     PEKEC
                         With a Ramses graph on the binary 
                         tree--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --But what he's doing, he's attaching 
                         an edge to the adjacent vertex. He 
                         can always failsafe to either side--

                                     PEKEC
                         Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!

               Pekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board.

                                     PEKEC
                         But I can always garbage out
                              (writes frantically)
                         All the way to "N" to the minus one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, there's a limit.

                                     PEKEC
                         The limit is not found!
                              (turns to Will)
                         The limit is not found.

                                     WILL
                         But I can always go to the other 
                         side.

                                     PEKEC
                         There is no proof--

               Lambeau can no longer contain himself.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is 
                         three to the K times--

                                     PEKEC
                         --But--

                                     WILL
                         Look, I wrote it down.

               They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The 
               image is cast over their faces. It reads:

               As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him:

                                     WILL
                         It's just simpler this way.

               Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Alexander, your theory is changed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar in her room, post coital. They are wrapped 
               in a sheet. Will is absent-mindedly playing the memory game 
               SIMON.

               The pattern grows increasingly complex. After a beat:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why do we always stay here?

                                     WILL
                         'Cause it's nicer than my place.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I've never seen your place.

                                     WILL
                         Exactly.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your friends? Or your 
                         brothers? When do I get to meet them?

                                     WILL
                         They don't come over here that much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I think I can make it to South Boston.

                                     WILL
                         Aah, it's kind of a hike.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is it me you're hiding from them or 
                         the other way around?

                                     WILL
                         All right, all right. We'll go.

                                     SKYLAR
                         When?

                                     WILL
                         Sometime. I don't know. Next week.

                                     SKYLAR
                         What if I said I wouldn't sleep with 
                         you again until you let me meet your 
                         friends?

                                     WILL
                         I'd say...
                              (reaches for phone)
                         It's only four in the mornin', they're 
                         prob'ly up.

               She laughs. Stops him.

                                     SKYLAR
                         You men are shameful. If you're not 
                         thinking of your wiener then you're 
                         acting on its behalf.

                                     WILL
                         Then on behalf of my wiener, I'd 
                         like to ask for an advance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Skylar and Will sit together along with Will's gang. The 
               boys are considerably drunk, but it makes for good 
               entertainment.

               Everyone here is having fun including Sylar.

                                     MORGAN
                         Will, I can't believe you brought 
                         Skylar here when we're all wrecked. 
                         What's she gonna think about us?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity 
                         that we'd be out drinkin'.

                                     BILLY
                         I've been shit faced for like two 
                         weeks.

                                     MORGAN
                         Oh great, tell her that! Now she 
                         really thinks we're problem drinkers!

                         Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle 
                         Marty? Will knows him. That guy 
                         fuckin' drinks like you've never 
                         seen! One night he was drivin' back 
                         to his house on I-93 -- Statie pulls 
                         him over.

                                     ALL
                         Oh shit.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Guy's tryin' to walk the line -- but 
                         he can't even fuckin' stand up, and 
                         so my uncle's gonna spend a night in 
                         jail.  Just then there's this fuckin' 
                         BOOM like fifty yards down the road. 
                         Some guy's car hit a tree.

                                     MORGAN

                         Yeah, he was probably drunker than 
                         my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the 
                         cop goes "Stay here" And he goes 
                         runnin' down the highway to deal 
                         with the other crash. So, my Uncle 
                         Marty's standin' on the side of the 
                         road for a little while, and he's so 
                         fuckin' lit, that he forgets what 
                         he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck 
                         it." He gets in his car and drives 
                         home.

                                     MORGAN
                         Holy shit.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         So in the morning, there's a knock 
                         on the door it's the Statie. So my 
                         Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" 
                         And the Statie's like "I pulled you 
                         over and you took off."  And my 
                         Uncle's like "I never seen you before 
                         in my life, I been home all night 
                         with my kids." And Statie's like 
                         "Let me get in your garage!" So he's 
                         like "All right, fine." He takes 
                         around the garage and opens the door --
                         and the Statie's cruiser is in my 
                         Uncle's garage.

                                     ALL
                         No way! You're kiddin'!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         No, he was so hammered that he drove 
                         the police cruiser home. Fuckin' 
                         lights and everything!

                                     MORGAN
                         Did your Uncle get arrested?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed 
                         he didn't do anything. The fuckin' 
                         guy had been drivin' around in my 
                         Uncle's car all night lookin' for 
                         the house.

               Everyone is laughing. Skylar speaks above the din.

                                     SKYLAR
                         There was this Irish guy, walking 
                         down the beach one day.

               She has everyone's attention. Will is nervous.

                                     SKYLAR
                         And he comes across a bottle, and 
                         this Genie pops out. The genie turns 
                         to the Irishman and says -- "You've 
                         released me from my prison, so I'll 
                         grant you three wishes." The Irish 
                         guy thinks for a minute and says 
                         "What I really want is a pint of 
                         Guiness that never empties."  And -- 
                         POOF! A bottle appears. He slams it 
                         down, and -- lo and behold -- it 
                         fills back up again.

               C/U of Will. Hoping the joke pans out.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, the Irish guy can't believe 
                         it. He drinks it again, and again -- 
                         BOOM!  It fills back up. So, while 
                         the Irish guy is marveling at his 
                         good fortune, The Genie is getting 
                         impatient, because it's hot and he 
                         wants to get on with his freedom. He 
                         says "Let's go, you have two more 
                         wishes." The Irish guy slams his 
                         drink again, it fills back up, he's 
                         still amazed. The Genie can't take 
                         it anymore. He says "Buddy, I'm 
                         boiling out here. What are your other 
                         two wishes?"
                              (beat)
                         The Irish guy looks at his drink, 
                         looks at the Genie and says... "I 
                         guess I'll have two more of these."

               The gang erupts with laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a good thing no one's Irish 
                         here.

                                     MORGAN
                         I'm Irish.

               Chuckie, Will look at Morgan, baffled.

               EXT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER

               Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over 
               to Will and Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I'm glad you came by, changed my 
                         opinion of Harvard people.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.

               Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what the fuck you're 
                         doin'.  You're givin' us a ride.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What do I look like, Al Cowlins?
                              (seriously)
                         You want to take my car, drop her 
                         off?

                                     WILL
                         I was countin' on it.

                                     MORGAN
                         Chuck, let's go.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' 
                         the car.

               Morgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows 
               with an indifferent shrug.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks, Chuck.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Don't get too slap-happy, you're 
                         takin' me home first.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta 
                         the way.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Just 'cause you don't have to sleep 
                         in the one room palace, don't start 
                         thinkin' you're bad.

                                     SKYLAR
                              (to Will)
                         I thought you said you'd show me 
                         your place.

                                     WILL
                         Not tonight.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, not tonight. Not any other 
                         night.

               He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped 
               like a bad habit.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I wanted to meet your brothers...

               Chuckie gives Will a curious look.

                                     WILL
                         They're all sleepin' now.
                              (a beat, to Chuckie)
                         Let me get those keys.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FACULTY CLUB -- NIGHT

               A cocktail party is underway. Professors mingle with

               representatives from high tech companies. Lambeau stands 
               holding a drink and surrounded by several RECRUITERS. 
               Apparently he's the star of the show.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         What I want to know, Gerry, is when 
                         we get to meet this wonder-boy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         We're still working together, the 
                         boy's a little rough.

                                     RECRUITER #2
                         We've got our share of eccentric 
                         geniuses at Tri-tech. We know how to 
                         deal with that.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         I think we all do.

               Laughter.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         If you're not exaggerating, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty-
                         four when I told you I'd win the 
                         Field's medal within two years?

               More laughter.

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         In that case the boy could run 
                         shipping for us, routing--

                                     RECRUITER #2
                         You say he doesn't have a diploma, 
                         but we'll

                                     RECRUITER #1
                         I don't need to see a driver's 
                         license.  I can think of three 
                         departments right now that he could 
                         head up for us.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         At ease, gentlemen. We're looking 
                         carefully at all our options.

                                     RECRUITER #3
                         All right, Gerry. Close to the vest.
                              (gives him his card)
                         Good luck with these vultures.

               He walks off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TIMMY'S TAP -- DAY

               Timmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the L Street 
               Bar. Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to TIMMY (45) the 
               owner of the place, and several other REGULARS.

                                     SEAN
                         So she goes runnin' up the aisle and 
                         I figure "fuck it" and I yell out 
                         "don't forget the coffee!

               The men erupt in laughter. MARTY, one of the regulars pipe 
               up.

                                     MARTY
                         Bullshit! You didn't say that!

               Timmy and Sean exchange a look.

                                     TIMMY
                         Jesus Christ, Marty. It's a joke.

               Lambeau enters, a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie.

                                     SEAN
                         Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Not at all.

                                     SEAN
                         Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend 
                         of mine. We went to college together.

                                     TIMMY
                         Good to meet you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Pleasure to meet you.

                                     SEAN
                         Could we get a couple of sandwiches?
                              (beat, smiles)
                         Put it on my tab.

               Sean heads towards a table.

                                     TIMMY
                         You ever plan on payin' your tab?

                                     SEAN
                              (pulls out lottery 
                              ticket)
                         I got the winning numbers right here.

                                     TIMMY
                         What's the jackpot?

                                     SEAN
                         Twelve million.

                                     TIMMY
                         I don't think that'll cover it.

               Lambeau follows [Sean]. They sit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're here quite a bit, then.

                                     SEAN
                         I live right around the corner.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You moved?

                                     SEAN
                         I been here a couple years.

               There is an awkward moment.

                                     SEAN
                         You wanted to talk about Will?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Seems like it's going well.

                                     SEAN
                         I think so.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, have you talked to him at all 
                         about his future?

                                     SEAN
                         We haven't really gotten into it.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Maybe you should. My phone's been 
                         ringing off the hook with job offers.

                                     SEAN
                         Jobs doing what?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks.
                         The kind of place where a mind like 
                         Will's is given free reign.

                                     SEAN
                         That's great, Gerry, that there's 
                         interest -- But I'm not sure he's 
                         ready for that.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I really don't think you 
                         understand--

                                     SEAN
                         What don't I understand?

               Timmy comes over with the sandwiches.

                                     SEAN
                         Thanks, Timmy.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us?
                         We're trying to settle a bet.

                                     TIMMY
                         Uh-oh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Have you heard of Jonas Salk?

                                     TIMMY
                         Yeah, cured polio.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You've heard of Albert Einstein?

               Timmy smiles. Gives him a look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard 
                         of him?

                                     TIMMY
                         No.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Okay thank you, Timmy.

                                     TIMMY
                         So who won the bet?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I did.

               A beat. Timmy leaves.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This isn't about me. I'm nothing 
                         compared to this young man.
                              (beat)
                         Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of 
                         Professors who were renowned for 
                         their study of the universe. But it 
                         was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk, 
                         doing physics in his spare time, who 
                         changed the world, Sean. Can you 
                         imagine if Einstein had given that 
                         up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies 
                         in Vienna every night? All of us 
                         would have lost something. And I'm 
                         quite sure Timmy never would have 
                         heard of him.

                                     SEAN
                         Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He 
                         just hasn't got the direction. We 
                         can give that to him.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         He married his cousin.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Who?

                                     SEAN
                         Einstein. Had two marriages, both 
                         trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his 
                         kids, one of whom, I think, ended up 
                         in an asylum- possible Unabomber 
                         addition--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You see, Sean? That's exactly not 
                         the point. No one remembers that. 
                         They--

                                     SEAN
                         I do.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, you're the only one.

               Beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This boy can make contributions to 
                         the world. We can help him do that.

                                     SEAN
                         Just... take it easy, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, I don't know what else I can 
                         say.  I'm not sitting at home every 
                         night, twisting my mustache and 
                         hatching a plan to ruin the boy's 
                         life. But it's important to start 
                         early. I was doing advanced 
                         mathematics at eighteen and it still 
                         took me twenty-three years to do 
                         something worthy of a Field's medal.

                                     SEAN
                         Maybe he doesn't care about that.

               A beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, this is important. And it's 
                         above personal rivalry--

                                     SEAN
                         Now wait a minute, Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, no you hear me out, Sean. This 
                         young man is a true prodigy--

                                     SEAN
                         Personal rivalry? I'm not getting 
                         back at you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look, you took one road and I took 
                         another. That's fine.

                                     SEAN
                         Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think 
                         it's fine with you. Give him time to 
                         figure out what he wants.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It 
                         worked wonders for you.

               A beat. Lambeau gets up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, I came here today out of 
                         courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in 
                         the loop. As we speak the boy is in 
                         a meeting I set up for him over at 
                         Tri-tech.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, OFFICE -- SAME

               Three well dressed TRI-TECH EXECUTIVES sit around a conference 
               table, which is littered with promotional brochures. The 
               executives exchange a confused look. One of them speaks.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                              (tentative)
                         Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure 
                         what you mean, we've already offered 
                         you a position..

               Cut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives, 
               hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Since this is obviously not my first 
                         time in such altercations, let me 
                         say this:

               Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating 
               "cash." The executives are baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, we can do this the easy way or 
                         the hard way.

               The executives are completely blank.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         At the current time I am looking at 
                         a number of different fields from 
                         which to disseminate which offer is 
                         most pursuant aid to my benefit.
                              (a beat)
                         What do you want? What do I want? 
                         What does anybody want? Leniency.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I'm not sure--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         --These circumstances are mitigated.
                         Right now. They're mitigated.

               Chuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the 
               room.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Okay...

               Chuckie points to the third executive.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         He knows what I'm talking about.

               The third executive is baffled.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         A retainer. Nobody in this town works 
                         without a retainer. You think you 
                         can find someone who does, you have 
                         my blessin'. But I think we all know 
                         that person isn't going to represent 
                         you as well as I can.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will, our offer starts you at eighty-
                         four thousand a year, plus benefits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Retainer...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         You want us to give you cash right 
                         now?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Allegedly, what I am saying is your 
                         situation will be concurrently 
                         improved if I had two hundred sheets 
                         in my pocket right now.

               The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I don't think I... Larry?

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         I have about seventy-three...

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Will you take a check?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Come now... what do you think I am, 
                         a juvenile? You don't got any money 
                         on you right now. You think I'm gonna 
                         take a check?

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         It's fine, John, I can cover the 
                         rest.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         That's right, you know.
                              (turns to #1)
                         He knows.

               Chuckie stands up and takes the money.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (to exec #1)
                         You're suspect. I don't know what 
                         your reputation is, but after the 
                         shit you tried to pull today, you 
                         can bet I'll be looking into it. Any 
                         conversations you want to have with 
                         me heretofore, you can have with my 
                         attorney. Gentlemen, keep your ears 
                         to the grindstone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AU BON PAIN COURTYARD, HARVARD SQUARE -- DAY

               Will and Skylar sit in the open courtyard of this Harvard 
               Square eatery. Skylar is working on another O-chem lab. Will 
               sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.

                                     WILL
                         How's it goin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fine.

                                     WILL
                         Want me to take a look?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No.

                                     WILL
                         C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go 
                         to the battin' cages.

                                     SKYLAR
                         It's important that I learn this.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it important to you? If I 
                         inherited all that money, the only 
                         thing important to me would be workin' 
                         on my swing.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Clearly.

                                     WILL
                         You're rich. What do you have to 
                         worry about?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Rich? I have an inheritance. It's 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand 
                         dollars.  That's exactly what it'll 
                         cost me, minus about five hundred 
                         bucks, to go all the way through med 
                         school. This is what I'm doing with 
                         that money. I could have done anything 
                         I wanted. I could have expanded my 
                         wardrobe, substantially.

                                     WILL
                         Instead you're going to bust your 
                         ass for five years so you can be 
                         broke?

                                     SKYLAR
                         No, so I can be a doctor.

               A beat. Will nods. She looks down, then up.

                                     SKYLAR
                         All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me 
                         ask you a question? Do you have a 
                         photographic memory?

                                     WILL
                         I guess. I don't know. How do you 
                         remember your phone number?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Have you ever studied Organic 
                         Chemistry?

                                     WILL
                         Some, a little.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Just for fun?

                                     WILL
                         I guess so.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Nobody does organic chemistry for 
                         "fun."  It's unnecessary. Especially 
                         for someone like you.

                                     WILL
                         Like me?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah. Someone like you who divides 
                         his time, fairly evenly, between the 
                         batting cages and bars.

               Will laughs.

                                     SKYLAR
                         How did you do that? I can't... I 
                         mean even the smartest people I know, 
                         and we do have a few at Harvard, 
                         have to study- a lot. It's hard.
                              (beat)
                         Listen, Will, if you don't want to 
                         tell me--

                                     WILL
                         Do you play the piano?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come one Will. I just want to know.

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to explain it to you. So 
                         you play the piano. When you look at 
                         the keys, you see music, you see 
                         Mozart.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.

                                     WILL
                         Well all right, Beethoven. He looked 
                         at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' 
                         guy was deaf when he composed the 
                         Ode to Joy. They had to turn him 
                         around to take a bow because he 
                         couldn't hear the crowd going crazy 
                         behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all 
                         of that music in his head.

                                     SKYLAR
                         So, do you play the piano?

                                     WILL
                         Not a lick. I look at a piano and I 
                         see black and white keys, three pedals 
                         and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, 
                         they looked at it and it just made 
                         sense to them. They saw a piano and 
                         they could play. I couldn't paint 
                         you a picture, I probably can't hit 
                         the ball out of Fenway Park and I 
                         can't play the piano--

                                     SKYLAR
                         But you can do my O-chem lab in under 
                         an hour, you can--

                                     WILL
                         When it came to stuff like that I 
                         could always just play.

               Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp. 
               So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I can't believe it's taken me four 
                         years to meet you and I'm going to 
                         California in two months, Will.
                              (beat)
                         Have you ever been to California? I 
                         bet you'd like it.

               Will freezes. A beat.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Maybe not.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHUCKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Chuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers 
               and a tee-shirt, eating cereal. The doorbell rings. He sits.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Get it, ma!

               She doesn't. He gets up. Opens door. It's Skylar.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (surprised)
                         Hey.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Hi.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How you doin'?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Good.

               An awkward beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         How'd you know where to find me?

                                     SKYLAR
                              (smiles)
                         You were the only Sullivan in the 
                         phone book.

               Chuckie smiles.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will and I dropped you off here, 
                         remember?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh, right.

                                     SKYLAR
                         This is your house, right?

               Chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted 
               by a nagging shriek from his mom.

                                     CHUCKIE'S MOM (O.S.)
                         Get in here, Chuckie!

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (calling back)
                         Pipe down, Ma!

                                     SKYLAR
                         I guess so.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What? No. This is my mother's house. 
                         I don't live with my mother. I just 
                         stop by, help out. I'm good like 
                         that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is this a bad time?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         She'll live.
                              (beat)
                         If she starts yelling again I might 
                         have to run in real quick and beat 
                         her with the stick again but...

                                     SKYLAR
                         Okay.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let's take a walk.

               EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY

               Chuckie, still in his boxers walks with Skylar who is talking.

                                     SKYLAR
                         See, now this doesn't feel right.
                              (beat)
                         When I made the decision to come 
                         over here it felt right. I had all 
                         these rationalizations... I just 
                         don't understand why Will never tells 
                         me anything, he won't let me get 
                         close to him, he tells me these weird 
                         lies--

                                     CHUCKIE
                         You caught that, huh?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I just wanted to find out what was 
                         going on... But now that I'm here it 
                         seems strange, doesn't it?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Well, I don't have no trousers on...

               She laughs. A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         I know why you're here. Will don't 
                         talk much.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't care what his family's like 
                         or if he doesn't have any brothers, 
                         but he doesn't have to lie to me.

                         I really don't know what to say. 
                         Look, I lie to women all the time. 
                         That's just my way.
                              (beat)
                         Last week Morgan brought these girls 
                         down from Roslindale. I told them I 
                         was a cosmonaut. They believed me. 
                         But Will's not usually like that--

                                     MAN ON PORCH
                         Put some clothes on, Sullivan!

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Take it easy father!

               She laughs.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         All I can say is; I known Will a 
                         long time -- And I seen him with 
                         every girl he's ever been with. But 
                         I've never seen him like this before, 
                         ever with anyone, like how he is 
                         with you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that true?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, it is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Tom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau.

                                     TOM
                         !!! !

                                     WILL
                         !!! !

               Lambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has completed.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is correct. I see you used 
                         Mclullen here--

                                     WILL
                         I don't know what it's called.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --This can't be right.
                              (examining proof)
                         This is going to be very embarrassing.
                         Have you ever considered--

                                     WILL
                         I'm pretty sure it's right.

               Will gets up to leave.

                                     WILL
                              (turning back)
                         Can I ask you a favor, can we do 
                         this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I 
                         leave work to come here and the 
                         fuckin' commute is killin' me--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's fine, but did you ever think--

                                     WILL
                         It's right.
                              (a beat, heading out)
                         Take it home with you.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, what happened at the Tri-tech 
                         meeting?

                                     WILL
                         I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. 
                         So I sent my chief negotiator.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Will, on your own time, you can do 
                         what you like. When I set up a 
                         meeting, with my associates, and you 
                         don't show up it reflects poorly on 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         Then don't set up any more meetings.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I'll cancel every meeting right now.
                         I'll give you a job myself. I just 
                         wanted you to see what was out there.

                                     WILL
                         Maybe I don't want to spend my life 
                         sittin' around and explaining shit 
                         to people.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The least you can do is show me a 
                         little appreciation.

                                     WILL
                              (indicates proof)
                         You know how fuckin' easy this is to 
                         me? This is a joke!
                              (crumples proof)
                         And I'm sorry you can't do this. I 
                         really am. 'Cause if you could I 
                         wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble 
                         around and fuck it up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sure, then you'd have more time to 
                         sit around and get drunk. Think of 
                         how many fights you could have been 
                         in by now.

               Will turns around reveling that he's lit the PROOF ON FIRE. 
               Will drops it on the floor. Lambeau drops to his knees and 
               puts it out. He looks up at Will.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're right, Will. I can't do that 
                         proof and you can. And when it comes 
                         to this there are only twenty people 
                         in the world that can tell the 
                         difference between you and me. But 
                         I'm one of them.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm sorry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         So am I.
                              (beat)
                         Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I 
                         wish I never met you. Because then I 
                         could sleep at night. I wouldn't 
                         have to walk around with the knowledge 
                         that someone like you was out there. 
                         And I wouldn't have to watch you 
                         throw it all away.

               Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the 
               wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Will and Skylar lie in bed. Skylar watches Will sleep. She 
               gets up and goes to the fridge. Returning to the bed:

                                     SKYLAR
                         Will? Are you awake?

                                     WILL
                         No.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Come with me to California.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I want you to come with me.

                                     WILL
                         How do you know that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I know. I just do.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, but how do you know?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't know. I just feel it.

                                     WILL
                         And you're sure about that?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yeah, I'm sure.

                                     WILL
                         'Cause that's a serious thing you're 
                         sayin'. I mean, we might be in 
                         California next week and you could 
                         find out somethin' about me that you 
                         don't like. And you might feel like 
                         "hey this is a big mistake."
                              (getting upset)
                         But you can't take it back, 'cause 
                         you know it's real serious and you 
                         can't take somethin' like that back. 
                         Now I'm in California, 'cause you 
                         asked me to come. But you don't really 
                         want me there. And I'm stuck in 
                         California with someone who really 
                         doesn't want me there and just wishes 
                         they had a take-back.

                                     SKYLAR
                         "Take-back?" What is that? I don't 
                         want a take-back. I want you to come 
                         to California with me.

                                     WILL
                         I can't go out to California.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why not?

                                     WILL
                         One, because I have a job here and 
                         two because I live here--

                                     SKYLAR
                              (beat)
                         Look, Will if you're not in love 
                         with me, you can say that.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with 
                         you.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Then what are you afraid of?

                                     WILL
                         What do you mean "What am I afraid 
                         of?"

                                     SKYLAR
                         Why won't you come with me? What are 
                         you so scared of?

                                     WILL
                         What am I scared of?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Well, what aren't you scared of?  
                         You live in your safe little world 
                         where nobody challenges you and you're 
                         scared shitless to do anything else--

                                     WILL
                         Don't tell me about my world. You're 
                         the one that's afraid. You just want 
                         to have your little fling with the 
                         guy from the other side of town and 
                         marry--

                                     SKYLAR
                         Is that what you think--

                                     WILL
                         some prick from Stanford that your 
                         parents will approve of. Then you'll 
                         sit around with the rest of the upper 
                         crust kids and talk about how you 
                         went slummin' too.

                                     SKYLAR
                         I inherited that money when I was 
                         thirteen, when my father died.

                                     WILL
                         At least you have a mother.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Fuck you! You think I want this? 
                         That money's a burden to me. Every 
                         day I wake up and I wish I could 
                         give that back.  I'd give everything 
                         I have back to spend one more day 
                         with my father. But that's life. And 
                         I deal with it. So don't put that 
                         shit on me. You're the one that's 
                         afraid.

                                     WILL
                         What the fuck am I afraid of?!

                                     SKYLAR
                         You're afraid of me. You're afraid 
                         that I won't love you back. And guess 
                         what?  I'm afraid too. But at least 
                         I have the balls to it give it a 
                         shot. At least I'm honest with you.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not honest?

                                     SKYLAR
                         What about your twelve brothers?

                                     WILL
                         Oh, is that what this is about? You 
                         want to hear that I don't really 
                         have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' 
                         orphan? Is that what you want to 
                         hear?

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?

                                     WILL
                         No, you don't want to hear that.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes, I do, Will.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that I got 
                         cigarettes put out on me when I was 
                         a little kid. That this isn't surgery.

               Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso.

                                     WILL
                         You don't want to hear that. Don't 
                         tell me you want to hear that shit!!

                                     SKYLAR
                         Yes I do. Did you ever think that 
                         maybe I could help you? That maybe 
                         that's the point, that we're a team?

                                     WILL
                         What, you want to come in here and 
                         save me? Is that what you want to 
                         do? Do I have a sign that says "save 
                         me" on my back?

                                     SKYLAR
                         I don't want to "save" you. I just 
                         want to be with you. I love you. I 
                         love you!

               Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her.

                                     WILL
                         Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' 
                         bullshit me!

                                     SKYLAR
                              (standing up to him)
                         You know what I want to hear?  I 
                         want to hear that you don't love me. 
                         If you tell me that, then I'll leave 
                         you alone. I won't ask any questions 
                         and I won't be in your life.

               A beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand.

                                     WILL
                         I don't love you.

               He walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and 
               ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and 
               looking sharp in twin navy blue suits.

                                     WILL
                         So why do you think I should work 
                         for the National Security Agency?

                                     DYTRESS
                         Well, you'd be working on the cutting 
                         edge. You'd be exposed to the kind 
                         of technology you couldn't see 
                         anywhere else because we've classified 
                         it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, 
                         Advanced algorithms--

                                     WILL
                         Codebreaking.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's one aspect of what we do.

                                     WILL
                         Come on, that's what you do. You 
                         handle more than eighty percent of 
                         the intelligence workload. You're 
                         seven times the size of the C.I.A.

                                     DYTRESS
                         That's exactly right, Will. So the 
                         question as I see it isn't "why should 
                         you work for N.S.A." it's "why 
                         shouldn't you?"

                                     WILL
                         Why shouldn't I work for the National 
                         Security Agency? That's a tough one.

               Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy 
               cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both 
               boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear 
               the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE 
               emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in 
                         my mom's room again I'm gonna give 
                         you a fuckin' beatin'!

               After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced.

                                     MORGAN
                              (innocently)
                         What's up guys?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Why don't you beat off at your house?

                                     MORGAN
                         I don't have a VCR at my house.

               Will pays no attention to this exchange

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I never cared about that.

               An awkward beat.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                                     SKYLAR

                              (pause)
                         No take-backs.

               Will says nothing.

                         Will?

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Take care.

                                     SKYLAR
                         Goodbye.

               Will hangs up. Hold on him for an agonizing beat.

               Will picks up a FRAME from Sean's desk. It is CARLTON FISK'S 
               BASEBALL CARD. Will has to smile. Lambeau looks up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What are you smiling at?

                         It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.

               Will can see that Lambeau wants more.

                         Oh, well, it's just somethin' Sean 
                         told me. It's a long story.

               A beat.

                         can do at home.

               Will gets up.

                         excited about how the meeting went.

               Lambeau is excited. Will clearly is not.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

                         So you might be working for Uncle

                         I don't know.

                         Gerry says the meeting went well.

                                     WILL
                         I guess.

                                     SEAN
                         What did you think?

                                     WILL
                         What did I think?

               A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this.

                                     WILL
                         Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody 
                         puts a code on my desk, something 
                         nobody else can break. So I take a 
                         shot at it and maybe I break it. And 
                         I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I 
                         did my job well.  But maybe that 
                         code was the location of some rebel 
                         army in North Africa or the Middle 
                         East. Once they have that location, 
                         they bomb the village where the rebels 
                         were hiding and fifteen hundred people 
                         I never had a problem with get killed. 
                         (rapid fire) Now the politicians are 
                         sayin' "send in the Marines to secure 
                         the area" 'cause they don't give a 
                         shit. It won't be their kid over 
                         there, gettin' shot. Just like it 
                         wasn't them when their number got 
                         called, 'cause they were pullin' a 
                         tour in the National Guard. It'll be 
                         some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel 
                         in the ass.  And he comes home to 
                         find that the plant he used to work 
                         at got exported to the country he 
                         just got back from. And the guy who 
                         put the shrapnel in his ass got his 
                         old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen 
                         cents a day and no bathroom breaks. 
                         Meanwhile my buddy from Southie 
                         realizes the only reason he was over 
                         there was so we could install a 
                         government that would sell us oil at 
                         a good price. And of course the oil 
                         companies used the skirmish to scare 
                         up oil prices so they could turn a 
                         quick buck. A cute, little ancillary 
                         benefit for them but it ain't helping 
                         my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And 
                         naturally they're takin' their sweet 
                         time bringin' the oil back and maybe 
                         even took the liberty of hiring an 
                         alcoholic skipper who likes to drink 
                         seven and sevens and play slalom 
                         with the icebergs and it ain't too 
                         long 'til he hits one, spills the 
                         oil, and kills all the sea-life in 
                         the North Atlantic. So my buddy's 
                         out of work and he can't afford to 
                         drive so he's got to walk to the job 
                         interviews which sucks 'cause the 
                         shrapnel in his ass is givin' him 
                         chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile 
                         he's starvin' 'cause every time he 
                         tries to get a bite to eat the only 
                         blue-plate special they're servin' 
                         is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker 
                         State.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         So what'd I think?  I'm holdin' out 
                         for somethin' better. I figure I'll 
                         eliminate the middle man. Why not 
                         just shoot my buddy, take his job 
                         and give it to his sworn enemy, hike 
                         up gas prices, bomb a village, club 
                         a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and 
                         join the National Guard? Christ, I 
                         could be elected President.

                                     SEAN
                         Do you think you're alone?

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SEAN
                         Do you have a soul-mate?

                                     WILL
                         Define that.

                                     SEAN
                         Someone who challenges you in every 
                         way.  Who takes you places, opens 
                         things up for you. A soul-mate.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah.

               Sean waits.

                                     WILL
                         Shakespeare, Neitzche, Frost, 
                         O'Connor, Chaucer, Pope, Kant--

                                     SEAN
                         They're all dead.

                                     WILL
                         Not to me, they're not.

                                     SEAN
                         But you can't give back to them, 
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Not without a heater and some serious 
                         smelling salts, no...

                                     SEAN
                         That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll 
                         never have that kind of relationship 
                         in a world where you're afraid to 
                         take the first step because all you're 
                         seeing are the negative things that 
                         might happen ten miles down the road.

                                     WILL
                         Oh, what? You're going to take the 
                         professor's side on this?

                                     SEAN
                         Don't give me your line of shit.

                                     WILL
                         I didn't want the job.

                                     SEAN
                         It's not about that job. I'm not 
                         saying you should work for the 
                         government. But, you could do anything 
                         you want. And there are people who 
                         work their whole lives layin' brick 
                         so their kids have a chance at the 
                         kind of opportunity you have. What 
                         do you want to do?

                                     WILL
                         I didn't ask for this.

                                     SEAN
                         Nobody gets what they ask for, Will.
                         That's a cop-out.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it a cop-out? I don't see 
                         anythin' wrong with layin' brick, 
                         that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. 
                         Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's 
                         gonna get to work the next day 'cause 
                         of me. There's honor in that.

                                     SEAN
                         You're right, Will. Any man who takes 
                         a forty minute train ride so those 
                         college kids can come in in the 
                         morning and their floors will be 
                         clean and their trash cans will be 
                         empty is an honorable man.

               A beat. Will says nothing.

                                     SEAN
                         And when they get drunk and puke in 
                         the sink, they don't have to see it 
                         the next morning because of you. 
                         That's real work, Will. And there is 
                         honor in that.  Which I'm sure is 
                         why you took the job.

               A beat.

                                     SEAN
                         I just want to know why you decided 
                         to sneak around at night, writing on 
                         chalkboards and lying about it.
                              (beat)
                         'Cause there's no honor in that.

               Will is silent.

                                     SEAN
                         Something you want to say?

               Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

                                     SEAN
                         Why don't you come back when you 
                         have an answer for me.

                                     WILL
                         What?

                                     SEAN
                         If you won't answer my questions, 
                         you're wasting my time.

                                     WILL
                         What?

               Will loses it, slams the door shut.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you!

               Sean has finally gotten to Will.

                                     WILL
                         Who the fuck are you to lecture me 
                         about life? You fuckin' burnout! 
                         Where's your "soul-mate?!"

               Sean lets this play out. Possible "shepard" change.

                                     WILL
                         Dead! She dies and you just cash in 
                         your chips. That's a fuckin' cop-
                         out!

                                     SEAN
                         I been there. I played my hand.

                                     WILL
                         That's right. And you fuckin' lost!  
                         And some people would have the sack 
                         to lose a big hand like that and 
                         still come back and ante up again!

                                     SEAN
                         Look at me. What do you want to do?

               A beat. Will looks up.

                                     SEAN
                         You and your bullshit. You got an 
                         answer for everybody. But I asked 
                         you a straight question and you can't 
                         give me a straight answer. Because 
                         you don't know.

               Sean goes to the door and opens it. Will walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

               Will and Chuckie take crowbars to a wall. This is what they 
               do for a living. As they routinely hammer away, Will becomes 
               more involved in his battle with the wall. Plaster and lathing 
               fly as Will vents his rage. Chuckie, noticing, stops working 
               and takes a step back, watching Will. Will is oblivious.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Lambeau and Tom are in his office. Will is nowhere to be 
               seen.

               Lambeau is on the phone.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What I mean, Sean, is that I'm sitting 
                         in your office and the boy isn't 
                         here.
                              (beat)
                         Well, it's ten past three.
                              (beat)
                         An hour and ten minutes late.
                              (beat)
                         Well, if he doesn't show up and I 
                         have to file a report saying he wasn't 
                         here and he goes back to jail, it 
                         won't be on my conscience, Sean.
                              (beat)
                         Fine.

               He hangs up. Tom picks up a FORM up off the desk.

                                     TOM
                         What should I do?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The boy was here. He came in, sat 
                         down and we worked together.

               A blank look.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He came in, sat down, and we worked 
                         together.

                                     TOM
                         Okay.

               Tom understands, begins filling out the form.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HANRAHAN'S PACKAGE STORE -- LATER

               Will walks out carrying a brown bag. He is filthy, having 
               just knocked off work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- PARKING LOT

               Chuckie is sitting on the hood of his Cadillac, watching 
               Will across the street. Chuckie is covered in grime as well. 
               Will starts walking towards Chuckie. As he draws closer, he 
               heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie 
               who handles it routinely.

               Will takes a seat next to Chuckie and they crack open their 
               beers. Other workers file out of the site. They drink.

                         How's the woman?

                                     WILL
                         Gone.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         She went to Medical school in 
                         California.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Sorry, brother.
                              (beat)
                         I don't know what to tell ya. You 
                         know all the girls I been with. You 
                         been with 'em too, except for Cheryl 
                         McGovern which was a big mistake on 
                         your part brother...

                                     WILL
                         Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of 
                         us has herpes.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Some shows are worth the price of 
                         admission, partner.

               This gets a small laugh from Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         My fuckin' back is killin' me.

               A passing SHEET METAL WORKER overhears this.

                                     SHEET METAL WORKER
                         That's why you should'a gone to 
                         college.

                                     WILL
                         Fuck you.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal 
                         pussy.
                              (beat)
                         So, when are you done with those 
                         meetin's?

                                     WILL
                         Week after I'm twenty-one.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Are they hookin' you up with a job?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, sit in a room and do long 
                         division for the next fifty years.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yah, but it's better than this shit. 
                         At least you'd make some nice bank.

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         It's a way outta here.

                                     WILL
                         What do I want a way outta here for?  
                         I want to live here the rest of my 
                         life. I want to be your next door 
                         neighbor. I want to take out kids to 
                         little league together up Foley Field.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Look, you're my best friend, so don't 
                         take this the wrong way, but in 20 
                         years, if you're livin' next door to 
                         me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin'
                         Patriots' games and still workin' 
                         construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. 
                         And that's not a threat, that's a 
                         fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.

                                     WILL
                         Chuckie, what are you talkin'...

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Listen, you got somethin' that none 
                         of us have.

                                     WILL
                         Why is it always this? I owe it to 
                         myself? What if I don't want to?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow 
                         I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty 
                         and I'll still be doin' this. And 
                         that's all right 'cause I'm gonna 
                         make a run at it.  But you, you're 
                         sittin' on a winning lottery ticket 
                         and you're too much of a pussy to 
                         cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause 
                         I'd do anything to have what you 
                         got! And so would any of these guys.  
                         It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if 
                         you're still here in twenty years.

                                     WILL
                         You don't know that.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Let me tell you what I do know. Every 
                         day I come by to pick you up, and we 
                         go out drinkin' or whatever and we 
                         have a few laughs. But you know what 
                         the best part of my day is? The ten 
                         seconds before I knock on the door 
                         'cause I let myself think I might 
                         get there, and you'd be gone. I'd 
                         knock on the door and you wouldn't 
                         be there. You just left.

               A beat.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Now, I don't know much. But I know 
                         that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This is a disaster! I brought you in 
                         here to help me with this boy, not 
                         to run him out--

                                     SEAN
                         Now wait a minute--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         --And confuse him--

                                     SEAN
                         --Gerry--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         And here I am for the second week in 
                         a row with my professional reputation 
                         at stake--

                                     SEAN
                         Hold on!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Ready to falsify documents because 
                         you've given him license to walk 
                         away from this.

                                     SEAN
                         I know what I'm doing and I know why 
                         I'm here!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Look Sean, I don't care if you have 
                         a rapport with the boy -- I don't 
                         care if you have a few laughs -- 
                         even at my expense! But don't you 
                         dare undermine what I'm trying to do 
                         here.

                                     SEAN
                         "Undermine?"

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He has a gift and with that gift 
                         comes responsibility. And you don't 
                         understand that he's at a fragile 
                         point--

                                     SEAN
                         He is at a fragile point. He's got 
                         problems--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         What problems does he have, Sean, 
                         that he is better off as a janitor 
                         or in jail or hanging around with--

                                     SEAN
                         Why do you think he does that, Gerry?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He can handle the work, he can handle 
                         the pressure and he's obviously 
                         handled you.

                                     SEAN
                         Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor?
                         Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because 
                         the first thing that happened to him 
                         was that he was abandoned by the 
                         people who were supposed to love him 
                         the most!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, come on, Sean--

                                     SEAN
                         And why does he hang out with his 
                         friends? Because any one of those 
                         kids would come in here and take a 
                         bat to your head if he asked them 
                         to. It's called loyalty!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Oh, that's nice--

                                     SEAN
                         And who do you think he's handling?  
                         He pushes people away before they 
                         have a chance to leave him. And for 
                         20 years he's been alone because of 
                         that. And if you try to push him 
                         into this, it's going to be the same 
                         thing all over again. And I'm not 
                         going to let that happen to him!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Now don't do that. Don't you do that!
                         Don't infect him with the idea that 
                         it's okay to quit. That it's okay to 
                         be a failure, because it's not okay! 
                         If you're angry at me for being 
                         successful, for being what you could 
                         have been--

                                     SEAN
                         --I'm not angry at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. 
                         And I'm not going to apologize for 
                         any success that I've had.

                                     SEAN
                         --I don't have any anger at you--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes you do. You're angry at me for 
                         doing what you could have done. Ask 
                         yourself if you want Will to feel 
                         that way for the rest of his life, 
                         to feel like a failure.

                                     SEAN
                         That's it. That's why I don't come 
                         to the goddamn reunions!  Because I 
                         can't stand the look in your eye 
                         when you see me! You think I'm a 
                         failure! I know who I am. I'm proud 
                         of who I am. And all of you, you 
                         think I'm some kind of pity case! 
                         You with your sycophant students 
                         following you around. And your Goddamn 
                         Medal!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Is that what this is about, Sean? 
                         The Field's Medal? Do you want me to 
                         go home and get it for you? Then 
                         will you let the boy--

                                     SEAN
                         I don't want your trophy and I don't 
                         give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew 
                         you when!! You and Jack and Tom 
                         Sanders. I knew you when you were 
                         homesick and pimply-faced and didn't 
                         know what side of the bed to piss 
                         on!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         That's right!  You were smarter than 
                         us then and you're smarter than us 
                         now! So don't blame me for how your 
                         life turned out. It's not my fault.

                                     SEAN
                         I don't blame you! It's not about 
                         that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause 
                         he's a good kid! And I won't see 
                         this happen to him- won't see you 
                         make him feel like a failure too!

                                     LAMBEAU
                         He won't be a failure!

                                     SEAN
                         If you push him into something, if 
                         you ride him--

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am 
                         today because I was pushed. And 
                         because I learned to push myself!

                                     SEAN
                         He's not you!

               A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns 
               to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.

                                     WILL
                         I can come back.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         No, that's fine, Will. I was just 
                         leaving.

               There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and 
               leaves.

                                     WILL
                         Well, I'm here.
                              (beat)
                         So, is that my problem? I'm afraid 
                         of being abandoned? That was easy.

                                     SEAN
                         Look, a lot of that stuff goes back 
                         a long way. And it's between me and 
                         him and it has nothing to do with 
                         you.

                                     WILL
                         Do you want to talk about it?

               Sean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk.

                                     WILL
                         What's that?

                                     SEAN
                         Oh, this is your file. I have to 
                         send it back to the Judge with my 
                         evaluation.

                                     WILL
                         You're not going to fail me are you?

               Sean smiles.

                                     WILL
                         So what's it say?

                                     SEAN
                         You want to read it?

                                     WILL
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         Have you had any experience with 
                         that?

                                     SEAN
                         Twenty years of counseling you see a 
                         lot of--

                                     WILL
                         No, have you had any experience with 
                         that?

                                     SEAN
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                              (smiles)
                         It sure ain't good.

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               From a child's P.O.V. we see a man, partially obscured by a 
               doorframe. The man turns toward the P.O.V.

                              (after a pause)
                         My dad used to make us walk down to 
                         the park and collect the sticks he 
                         was going to beat us with. Actually 
                         the worst of the beatings were between 
                         me and my brother. We would practice 
                         on each other trying to find sticks 
                         that would break.

                                     WILL
                         He used to just put a belt, a stick 
                         and a wrench on the kitchen table 
                         and say "choose."

               INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

               A large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick.

                                     WILL
                         I used to go with the wrench.

                         Cause fuck him, that's why.

               A long quiet moment.

                                     WILL
                         Is that why me and Skylar broke up?

                         I didn't know you had. Do you want 
                         to talk about that?
                              (beat)
                         I don't know a lot, Will. But let me 
                         tell you one thing. All this history,

                         Look here, son.

               Will, who had been looking away, loos at Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         This is not your fault.

                              (nonchalant)

               Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will 
               sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around 
               Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this 
               image. Two lonely souls being father and son together.

               Will rides the Red Line, above ground. He looks out over the

               Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through 
               the glass doors, into the lobby.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Can I help you?

                         here about a position.

               The guard reaches for the phone.

                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

                         Save it for your mother, funny guy. 
                         We heard it before.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Oh, Morgan.

               They both get up, in one another's face. This is a play fight.

               "You gonna start?" "You gonna pay my hospital bills?"

                              (to Chuckie)
                         You and Morgan throw?

                         No, I had to talk him down.

                         Why didn't you yoke him?

                         Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, 
                         dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid, 
                         they never fight, everyone's scared 
                         of 'em. You know how many people try 
                         to whip Morgan's ass every week? 
                         Fuckin' kid won't back down.

                                     MORGAN
                              (from across the table)
                         What'd you say about me?

                         Shut the fuck up.

               Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie 
               turns to Will.

                                     CHUCKIE
                              (To Will)
                         Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.

                         You thought we forgot, didn't you? I 
                         know I'm gettin' my licks in.

               Laughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out 
               the door.

               EXT. L STREET -- CONTINUOUS

               As they come out the door, rather than beating Will 
               mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal 
               rendition of "Danny Boy." No one joins in.

                         Shut up, Morgan.
                              (to Will)
                         Here's your present.

               Chuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in 
               front of the bar.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Yeah, I figured now that you got 
                         your big job over in Cambridge, you 
                         needed some way to get over there 
                         and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you 
                         every day...

               Laughter.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

                                     MORGAN
                         No I didn't...

               Will approaches the car to take a closer look.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         But you're twenty-one now, so--

                                     BILLY
                         Yeah, now that you can drink legally, 
                         we thought the best thing to get you 
                         was a car.

               More laughter. Will inspects the Nova.

                                     WILL
                         You're kiddin' me.
                              (a beat)
                         This is the ugliest fuckin' car I 
                         ever seen in my life.

               Laughter, a beat.

                                     WILL
                              (serious)
                         How the fuck did you guys do this?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Me and Bill scraped together the 
                         parts, worked on it. Morgan was out 
                         panhandlin' every day.

                                     MORGAN
                         Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose 
                         fuckin' router you think sanded out 
                         all that bondo?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Guy's been up my ass for two years 
                         about a fuckin' job. I had to let 
                         him help with the car.

                                     WILL
                         So, you finally got a job Morgan?

                                     MORGAN
                         Had one, now I'm fucked again.

                                     WILL
                              (to Chuckie)
                         So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai 
                         engine under there? Can I make it 
                         back to my house?

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Fuck you. I re-built the engine 
                         myself.  That thing could make it to 
                         Hawaii if you wanted it to.

               Chuckie gives Will a look.

                                     CHUCKIE
                         Happy 21, Will.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Will sits across from Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         Which one did you take, Will?

                                     WILL
                         Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs 
                         Professor Lambeau set me up with. I 
                         haven't told him yet, but I talked 
                         to my new boss over there and he 
                         seemed like a nice guy.

                                     SEAN
                         That's what you want?

                                     WILL
                         Yeah, I think so.

                                     SEAN
                         Good for you. Congratulations.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you.

                         So, that's it? We're done?

                                     SEAN
                         We're done. You did your time. You're 
                         a free man.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         I just want you to know, Sean...

                                     SEAN
                         You're Welcome, Will.

                                     WILL
                         I'll keep in touch.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I 
                         don't know where I'll be.

               Will smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         I just... figured it's time I put my 
                         money back on the table, see what 
                         kind of cards I get.

               Will smiles. Sean hands him a piece of paper.

                                     SEAN
                         I'll be checking in with my machine 
                         at the college. If you ever need 
                         anything, just call.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Do what's in your heart, son. You'll 
                         be fine.

                                     WILL
                         Thanks you, Sean.

               They embrace.

                                     SEAN
                         No. Thank you.

                                     WILL
                              (re: embrace)
                         Does this violate the patient/doctor 
                         relationship?

                                     SEAN
                         Only if you grab my ass.

               They laugh.

                                     WILL
                         See ya.

                                     SEAN
                         Good luck.

               Both men smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SEAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

               Will comes out of Sean's office and sees Lambeau walking up.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (surprised)
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, how you doin'?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         You know, you're no longer required 
                         to come here.

                                     WILL
                         I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (a beat)
                         Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He 
                         says you start working for them next 
                         week.

               Will nods.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Well, that's, I think that's terrific.
                         Congratulations.

                                     WILL
                         Thank you.

                         I just want you to know... It's been 
                         a pleasure.

                                     WILL
                         Bullshit.

               They laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         This job... Do it if it's what you 
                         really want.

                                     WILL
                         I appreciate that.

               A moment. Will starts to go, Lambeau watches him for a beat, 
               Will turns back around.

                                     WILL
                         Hey, Gerry.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                         Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you 
                         need some help, or you get stuck 
                         again, don't be afraid to give me a 
                         call.

                                     LAMBEAU
                              (has to smile)
                         Thank you, Will. I'll do that.

               Will smiles, turns and walks away.

               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Sean is packing his office. Lambeau opens the door.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Hello, Sean.

                         Come in.

                         Me too.

                         So I hear you're taking some time.

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd 
                         travel some. Maybe write a little 
                         bit.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Where're you going?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know. India maybe.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Why there?

                                     SEAN
                         Never been.

               Lambeau nods.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Do you know when you'll be back?

                                     SEAN
                              (picks up a flyer 
                              from his desk)
                         I got this mailer the other day. 
                         Class of Sixty-five is having this 
                         event in six months.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         I got one of those too.

                                     SEAN
                         You should come. I'll buy you a drink.

               Lambeau smiles.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean...

               A beat.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         The drinks at those things are free.

               Sean smiles.

                                     SEAN
                         Hell, I know that.

               Both men laugh.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         How about one now?

                                     SEAN
                         Sounds good.

               They start to walk out.

                                     SEAN
                         It's on you though, until eight 
                         o'clock tonight when I win my money.

               Sean pulls out his lottery ticket. They start out down the 
               hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               On their backs as they walk down the hall.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         Sean, do you have any idea what the 
                         odds are against winning the lottery?

                                     SEAN
                         I don't know... Gotta be at least 
                         four to one.

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

                                     SEAN
                         You're pretty quick with those 
                         numbers.  How about the odds of me 
                         buying the first round?

                                     LAMBEAU
                         About thirty million to one.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BANK OF THE CHARLES RIVER -- AFTERNOON

               Will sits alone, thinking. We hold on him for an extended 
               beat until he gets up and walks away.

               OMITTED

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- EARLY EVENING

               Begin final sequence.

               A wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the 
               sun is setting. The lights are on in one unit. A tighter 
               shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings 
               in cardboard boxes.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT, STREET -- SAME

               The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street, 
               where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking 
               up at Sean as he packs his things. Will's car is packed full 
               of clothes and books.

               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- SAME

               Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac.

               Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat 
               open for Will.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will holds an envelope which he slips in Sean's mailbox. He 
               puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his 
               apartment who is still unaware that Will is there.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie pulls up in front of Will's house. He honks the horn, 
               waits a beat, then gets out and heads toward the house.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Will drives away from Sean's house. Sean hears the car pull 
               out and looks out the window. Sean sees Will's car pulling 
               away.

               Curious, he investigates.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks up Will's front steps.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around. Seeing the 
               mailbox flag has been raised, he walks over to it.

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie knocks on Will's front door. There is no answer. He 
               waits a beat, looks in the window. An incredulous smile slowly 
               starts to form.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Sean opens the card Will left for him. It reads:

                                     WILL
                              (in writing)
                         Sean -- If the Professor calls about 
                         that job, just tell him, "Sorry, I 
                         had to go see about a girl."

               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the 
               broad smile. He knows Will is gone. He shrugs in explanation 
               to the guys. Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from 
               the curb.

               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

               We pan up from the letter to Sean. A broad smile comes over 
               him.

               This is a look we haven't seen. Sean is truly happy.

               EXT. MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE -- SUNSET

               Will is on the road, driving away. As we pull back and credits 
               roll, the car disappears into the horizon.

                                         THE END

1	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
	SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 

	Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
	see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
	As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
	and PHRASES as though from a public address system.

2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN

	in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is
	BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading.

3	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY

	Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there.

4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY

				BEN
		- and today it is right that we
		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge
		that I shall endeavor to carry it
		with me forever.

5	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	staring at him impassively.

6	INTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTS

	of impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing
	alone on the huge amphitheatre stage; of CLOSEUPS of Ben
	speaking; of loudspeakers; of wind-blown papers on the
	podium.

7	EXT. PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
			(continuing)
		The purpose, my fellow graduates - 
		the purpose is -

	He stops, trying to think of the word.

8	CLOSEUP - BEN

	He begins to sweat.

9	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE

	watching.

10	SHOT - PODIUM of AMPHITHEATRE

	Ben's hands searching through the pages of his speech.
	The pages begin to blow away in the wind.

11	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	staring.

12	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- there is a reason, my friends,
		and the reason is - 

13	CLOSEUP - BEN

	He is in a panic.  He looks up from his papers at the audience.

14	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	The audience is gone.

15	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- the reason is - the purpose is -

	SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at
	us through the air.

16	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE

		Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
		to begin our descent into Los Angeles -

	SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.

								CUT TO:

17	INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT

	His eyes open suddenly.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE
		The sound you have just heard is the
		landing gear locking into place.  The
		Los Angeles weather is clear and the
		temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do
		not expect any traffic delay and will
		make our four hour and eighteen minute
		flight plan smack on the nose.  We
		enjoyed having you on board and look
		forward to seeing you again in the near
		future.

18	SHOT

	PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with
	snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the
	ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them.

19	REVERSE ANGLE

	PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers
	staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and
	looks out the window.

20	EXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT

	Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every
	direction.

	SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH.

	START OF MAIN TITLES

	UNDER titles:

				STEWARDESS' VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your
		seat belts in preparation for the landing
		and observe the no smoking sign.  After
		we land, you will notice an increase in
		the sound level as the thrust of the engines
		is reversed to help reduce forward speed.

21	INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK - NIGHT

	Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Your attention, please!  American Airlines
		Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop
		to New York is now leaving from Gate
		Number 40.  All aboard, please.

28	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
	There are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
	in other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
	while, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
	of the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
	can be heard among them.

				MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE

		-- associate editor of the college
		newspaper in his junior year - 
		managing editor in his senior
		year -

	The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
	the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
	VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
	remainder of the sequence.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
	being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
	falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
	SNAPPED OFF.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What's the matter?

	Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		The guests are all downstairs,
		Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

				BEN
		Look, Dad - could you explain to
		them that I have to be alone for
		a while?

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		These are all our good friends,
		Ben.  Most of them have known you
		since - well - practically since
		you were born.

	Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
	as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What is it, Ben?

	The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

				BEN
		I'm just - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- worried?

				BEN
		Well - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		About what?

				Ben
		I guess - about my future.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		What about it?

				BEN
		I don't know.  I want it to be -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		To be what?

				BEN
			(quietly)
		Different.

	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
	MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Is anything wrong?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		No!  No - we're just on our way
		downstairs!

	Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
	picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Carlsons' are here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to Mrs. Braddock)
		They are?
			(to Ben)
		Come on.

	Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They came all the way from
		Tarzana.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		It's a wonderful thing to have
		so many devoted friends.

	They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
	Braddocks are moving down.

				MR. CARLSON
		Hey - there's our award winning
		scholar.

				MRS. CARLSON
		We're all very proud of you,
		Ben.

				BEN
		Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

				MR. CARLSON
		Is that the new car out there?
		The little red Wop job?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That's Ben's graduation present.

				MR. CARLSON
			(putting his arm
			across Ben's shoulder)
		Won't have much trouble picking
		them up in that, will you?

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. CARLSON
		The girls.  The chicks.  The -
		the teeny boppers.

				MRS. CARLSON
		I think Ben has gotten beyond
		the teeny bopper stage - haven't
		you, Ben?

	Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
	and return the wink politely.

				BEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

				BEN
		Excuse me - I think I'd just
		like to check something on
		the car for a minute -

	Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
	steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Here's the track star himself.
		How are you, track star?

				BEN
		Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

	Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
	hall.

				MR. LOOMIS
		I want to get a drink and then
		I want to hear all about that
		thing you won.  That Hopperman
		award.

				BEN
		Helpingham.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
		wait right here.

	Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
	moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
	the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
	lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

				LADY 1
		Ben - we're all so proud of
		you.

				LADY 2
		Proud, proud, proud, proud,
		proud.

				LADY 3
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I was going to go upstairs for a
		minute -

				LADY 3
		No - I meant with your future.

				LADY 2
		With your life.

				BEN
		Well - that's a little hard to say -

	MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben!

				Ben
			(to the ladies)
		Excuse me.
			(he turns around)
		Mr. McQuire

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(overwhelmed with pride)
		Ben.

				BEN
		Mr. McQuire.

	Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
	toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
	TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben - I just want to say one word to
		you - just one word -

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Are you listening?

				BEN
		Yes I am.

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(gravely)
		Plastics.

	They look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Exactly how do you mean?

				MR. MCQUIRE
		There is a great future in plastics.
		Think about it.  Will you think
		about it?

				BEN
		Yes, I will.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

	Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
	people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

				WOMAN #1
		Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

				BEN
		Excuse me just a minute -

	Ben goes into the house through the back door.

31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
	way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
	goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

	SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
	PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
	window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

	Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
	OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh.  I guess this isn't the
		bathroom, is it?

				BEN
		It's down the hall.

	They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you, Benjamin?

				BEN
		Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
		down at the end of the hall.

	Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
	of the bed.

				BEN
		Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
		mean to be rude but -

	Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
	lights it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is there an ashtray in here?

				BEN
		No.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh - I forgot.  The track star
		doesn't smoke.

	She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
	the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
	to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
	wastebasket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it a girl?

				BEN
		Is what a girl?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Whatever it is you're upset
		about.

				BEN
		Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
		disturbed about things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In general.

				BEN
		That's right.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to ask you
		something.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you take me home?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband took the car.  Will
		you drive me home?

	Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
	a set of car keys.

				BEN
		Here - you take it.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

				BEN
		Do you know how to work a
		foreign shift?

	Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

				BEN
		You don't?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.
			(there is a pause)

				BEN
		Let's go.

	She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

								CUT TO:

33	EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING THROUGH THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Mr. Braddock is
	talking to the Terhunes at the door.  Ben and Mrs.
	Robinson come down the hall.

				BEN
		Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride
		home.  I'll be right back.

	Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
	is walking ahead through the front door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(as she passes the
			CAMERA)
		Wonderful party.

								CUT TO:

34	OMITTED

35	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit
	for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	She doesn't move.  Ben gets out and goes around to her side
	and opens the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you come in, please?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want you to come in till I get
		the lights on.

				BEN
		What for?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't feel safe until
		I get the lights on.

	They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
	the door.

36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you mind walking ahead of
		me to the sun porch.  I feel
		funny about coming into a dark
		house.

				BEN
		But it's light in there now.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please.

	Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?  Bourbon?

				BEN
		Look - I drove you home.  I was
		glad to do it.  But I have some
		things on my mind.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		All right then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?

	He looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
		way, but I don't want to be
		alone in this house.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please wait till my husband
		gets home.

				BEN
		When is he coming back?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't know.

	She pours herself a drink.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drink?

				BEN
		No.

	She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

				BEN
		Are you always this much afraid
		of being alone?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, why can't you just lock
		the doors and go to bed?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'm very nuerotic.

	She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I ask you a question?

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you think of me?

				BEN
		What do you mean?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You've known me nearly all of
		your life.  You must have
		formed some opinion.

				BEN
		Well - I've always thought
		that you were a very - nice -
		person.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know I was an alcoholic?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know that?

				BEN
		Look - I think I should be
		going -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
		mind my saying so - this
		conversation is getting a
		little strange.  Now I'm sure
		that Mr. Robinson will be here
		any minute and -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband will be back quite
		late.

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He should be gone for several
		hours.

	She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
	retreats around the other side of the chair.

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Pardon?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What's wrong?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
		I mean you didn't expect -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean - you didn't really
		think that I would do something
		like that.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Like what?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I don't know.

				BEN
		For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
		here we are, you've got me into
		your house.  You give me a
		drink.  You put on music, now
		you start opening up your
		personal life to me and tell
		me your husband won't be home
		for hours.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		So?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
		to seduce me.

	There is a pause.  She looks at him.

				BEN
			(weaker)
		Aren't you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
		I feel rather flattered that
		you -

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
		me for what I just said?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's all right.

				BEN
		It's not all right, it's the
		worst thing I've ever said
		to anyone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down.

				BEN
		Please forgive me.  Because I
		like you.  I don't think of you
		that way.  But I'm mixed up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now finish your drink.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
		that I said that to you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'll forget it right now.
		Finish your drink.

				BEN
		What is wrong with me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you ever seen Elaine's
		portrait?

				BEN
		Her portrait?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We had it done last Christmas.
		Would you like to see it?

				BEN
		Very much.

	We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
	into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
	the doorway to Elaine's room.

37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

				BEN
		Elaine certainly is an
		attractive girl, isn't she?

	In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

				BEN
			(looking at the
			portrait)
		I don't remember her as having
		brown eyes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you unzip my dress?

	He steps back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I think I'll go to bed.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, goodnight.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Won't you unzip my dress?

				BEN
		I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you still think I'm trying
		to seduce you -

				BEN
		No, I don't.  But I just feel
		a little funny.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - you've known me all
		your life.

				BEN
		I know that.  But I'm -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Come on.

	She turns her back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's hard for me to reach.

	Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	Ben walks toward the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What are you so scared of?

				BEN
		I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then why do you keep running
		away?

				BEN
		Because you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Haven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?

				BEN
		Yes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

				BEN
		But I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What if he did?

				BEN
		Well, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you think he trusts us
		together?

				BEN
		Of course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't see why.  I'm twice as
		old as you are.  How could
		anyone think -

				BEN
		But they would!  Don't you see?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm not trying to
		seduce you.  I wish you'd -

				BEN
		I know that.  But please, Mrs.
		Robinson.  This is difficult
		for me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why is it?

				BEN
		Because I am confused about
		things.  I can't tell what
		I'm imagining.  I can't tell
		what's real.  I can't -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you like me to seduce you?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is that what you're trying to
		tell me?

				BEN
		I'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home
		right now.

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		BENJAMIN?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring up my purse before
		you go?

				BEN
		I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

	Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
	She is holding her dress in front of her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I really don't want to put this
		on again.  Won't you bring it
		up?

				BEN
		Where is it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On that chair in the hall.

	She walks out of the shot.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BEN
		Well here's the purse.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Could you bring it up?

				BEN
		Well I'll hand it to you.

	Ben starts back up the stairs.

				BEN
		Come to the railing and I'll
		hand it up.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin - I am getting pretty
		tired of all this suspicion.
		Now if you won't do me a simple
		favor I don't know what.

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

				BEN
		I'm putting it on the top step.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		For God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
	down the hall.

				BEN
		I'm putting it here by the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring it in to me?

				BEN
		I'd rather not.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		All right.  Put it in the room
		where we were.

				BEN
		Right.

38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.

				BEN
		Oh God.

	She smiles.

				BEN
		Let me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't be nervous.

				BEN
		Get away from that door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want to say something first.

				BEN
		Jesus Christ!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I want you to know
		I'm available to you.  If you
		won't sleep with me this time -

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you won't sleep with me this
		time, Benjamin, I want you to
		know you can call me up any
		time you want and we'll make
		some kind of arrangement.

				BEN
		Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand what I said?

				BEN
		Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I find you very attractive
		and any time -

	There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
	Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
	struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
	the hall and down the stairs.

39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

	Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
	FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
	the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
	SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Is that Ben's car in front?

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		Yes, sir!

	FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

				BEN
		I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
		home.  She wanted me to drive
		her home so I - I drove her home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Swell.  I appreciate it.

				BEN
		She's upstairs.  She wanted me
		to wait down here till you got
		home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Standing guard over the old
		castle, are you?

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

	Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Here.  It looks like you need
		a refill.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I've got to go.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is anything wrong?  You look
		a little shaken up.

				BEN
		No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
		a little worried about my
		future.  I'm a little upset
		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.

				BEN
		Thank you very much, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - how old are you now?

				BEN
		Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
		next week.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(taking out a
			cigarette)
		That's a hell of a good age
		to be.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I wish I was that age again.
		Because, Ben -

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. ROBINSON
		You'll never be young again.

				BEN
		I know.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, can I say something to
		you?

				BEN
		What?

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have we known each
		other now?

	Ben shakes his head.

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have you and I known
		each other?  How long have
		your Dad and I been partners?

				BEN
		Quite a while.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I've watched you grow up, Ben.

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		In many ways I feel as though
		you were my own son.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		So I hope you won't mind my
		giving you a friendly piece
		of advice.

				BEN
		I'd like to hear it.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I think - I think you
		ought to be taking it a little
		easier right now than you seem
		to.

	Ben nods.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
		as they come.  Have a good time
		with the girls and so forth.

	Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
	dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't get up.

	Ben sits.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I was just telling Ben here he
		ought to sow a few wild oats.
		Have a good time while he can.
		You think that's sound advice?

	Mrs. Robinson nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I do.

				BEN
		I've got to go.

	He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You have yourself a few flings
		this summer.  I bet you're
		quite a ladies' man.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?  You look like the kind
		of guy that has to fight them
		off.
			(to Mrs. Robinson)
		Doesn't he look to you like
		the kind of guy who has to
		fight them off?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, he does.

	They start out of the sunroom.

40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

				MR. ROBINSON
		Oh say - Elaine gets down from
		Berkeley on Saturday.

				BEN
		Oh yes.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I want you to give her a
		call.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Great.

	Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

41	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
	the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
	behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you for taking me home.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll see you soon, I hope.

	Ben continues to walk toward us.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen - your
		attention, please - for this after-
		noon's feature attraction.

								CUT TO:

42	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Hey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Are you ready in there, feature
		attraction?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Could I speak to you for a second,
		Dad?

	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
	and is readdressing his audience.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- what was I saying?

				MRS. ARNOLD
		Feature attraction.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
		you're paying attention.  A
		feature attraction that will be
		one of the most astounding
		events ever to take place in
		this particular backyard.

	They all laugh and some applaud.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Now I'm going to ask for a big
		round of applause to bring this
		boy out here - wait a minute -
		let me amend that - to bring
		this young man out here - because
		today he is twenty-one-years-
		old -

				MR. ARNOLD
			(his hands like
			a megaphone)
		Let's get on with the show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Just hang on a minute because
		I have a few words to say -

				MR. ARNOLD
		You always do.

	They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
	he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
	comeback.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - could we just talk about
		this for a second?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
		and gentlemen; four of those
		years spent accomplishing some
		rather extraordinary things at
		one of our nation's leading
		seats of learning -

				MR. ARNOLD
		Bring him out!

				PETER AND LOUISE
		On with the show!  On with the
		show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to the window)
		I can't hold them much longer,
		Ben.  You better get out here.

				BEN'S VOICE
		I'd like to discuss this.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to his audience)
		This boy - I'm sorry - this
		young man - is soon to continue
		his education as a Frank Halping-
		ham Award Scholar - but before
		he does -

	Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- before he does -
			(to the window)
		You're disappointing them, Ben.
		You're disappointing them.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - can you listen -

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(meaning it)
		I'll give you ten seconds.
			(back to the
			people)
		He is going to give us a
		practical demonstration of
		what I feel safe in saying is
		a pretty exciting birthday
		present - and it better work
		or I'm out over two hundred
		bucks - so let's hear it for -

	Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
	It slams against the wall inside.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- Benjamin Braddock!

44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY

	At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
	dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
	on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
	mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
	He holds a spear gun in his hand.

	The people applaud.

45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV

	The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
	outside the screen door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Folks - this remarkable young
		man is going to perform for you
		some spectacular and amazing
		feats of daring in water that is
		over six feet deep -

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)

	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
	the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
	down into it.

	PULL UP AND UP AND UP

	Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
	swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
	sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

								DISSOLVE TO:

47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
	the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
		know how to put this -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Look - I was thinking about that
		time after the party -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		- and I was wondering if I could
		buy you a drink or something -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		Uh - The Taft Hotel.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Did you get a room?

				BEN
		No.  Now I know it's pretty
		late and if you'd rather -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Give me an hour.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'll be there in an hour.

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.

				ROOM CLERK
		Can I help you, sir!

				BEN
		What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.

				ROOM CLERK
		Are you here for an affair,
		sir?

	Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
	helplessly at the clerk.

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		The Singleman party, sir?

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

				ROOM CLERK
		It's in the main ballroom.

				BEN
		Ahh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As Ben steps inside.

				VOICE
		Hello.

	Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
	they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
	LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
	are smiling with great determination.

				BEN
		Hello.

	It is the older lady who has said hello.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		You must be one of the Porters.

	She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm not -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'd like you to know my sister,
		Miss DeWitte -

	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
	been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

				MISS DeWITTE
		How do you do?

				BEN
		How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

	Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
	hand.

				BEN
			(apologetically)
		Oh - sorry -

				JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
		Fine, thank you.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		That's Jeffrey, of course.

	Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

				BEN
		Of course.

				MR. SINGLEMAN
		I didn't get your name, sir.

				BEN
		Benjamin Braddock, sir.

	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
	holding.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Braddock - Braddock?

				BEN
		Yes, but I'm afraid -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'll find your table in a moment.
		Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
		a Braniff.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm just looking
		for a friend.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'm afraid I don't understand.

				BEN
			(backing off)
		I'm not with your party - I'm
		sorry.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Hey - I don't get it.

	Ben is backing out.

				MISS DeWITTE
		I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
		Braniff.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Angela - please!

	Ben backs out of the ballroom.

49	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
	the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

50	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
	windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
	dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
	people seated around.

	The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
	and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
	by the window.

	PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

								CUT TO:

51	ANGLE ON BEN

	sitting smoking.

								CUT TO:

52	NEW ANGLE ON BEN

	sitting.

								CUT TO:

53	NEW ANGLE ON BEN

	sitting drinking.

								CUT TO:

54	ANGLE ON BEN

	In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
	She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
	toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
	not see her approach.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

	He rises quickly.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I sit down?

				BEN
		Of course.

	He pulls out a chair, for her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	They sit down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you?

				BEN
		Very well.  Thank you.

	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
	at the center of the table.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I have a drink?

				BEN
		A drink?  Of course.

	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
	The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
	Robinson apologetically.

				BEN
		He didn't see me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Waiter!

	For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
	waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
	moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
	The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I will have a martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Yes, madam.

	The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to be so nervous,
		you know.

				BEN
		Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
		nervous.  I mean it's - it's
		pretty hard to be suave when
		you're -

	He shakes his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you get us a room?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you gotten us a room yet?

				BEN
		I haven't.  No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to?

				BEN
		Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
		Or we could just talk.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want me to get it?

				BEN
		You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to get it now?

				BEN
		Now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I don't know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you get it.

				BEN
		Why don't I get it?  Well -
		I will then.
			(he stands up)
		If you'll excuse me.

	Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

55	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

				ROOM CLERK
		Yes sir?

				BEN
		A room.  I'd like a room,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		A single room or a double
		room?

				BEN
		A single.  Just for myself,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		Will you sign the register,
		please?

	He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
	name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
	crumples it up and fills out a second card.

				ROOM CLERK
		Is anything wrong, sir?

				BEN
		What?  No.  Nothing.

				ROOM CLERK
			(taking a key from
			behind the counter)
		Do you have any luggage, Mister --
			(looks at registration
			card)
		Gladstone?

				BEN
		Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is it?

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is your luggage?

				BEN
		Well it's in the car.  It's
		out in the car.

				ROOM CLERK
		Very good, sir.  I'll have a
		porter bring it in.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				ROOM CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		I mean I'd - I'd rather not
		go to the trouble of bringing
		it all in.  I just have a
		toothbrush.  I can get it my-
		self.  If that's all right.

				ROOM CLERK
		Of course.

	Ben reaches for the key.

				ROOM CLERK
		I'll have a porter show you the
		room.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
		soon find it myself.  I just have
		the toothbrush to carry up and
		I think I can manage it myself.

				ROOM CLERK
		Whatever you say, sir.

	He hands Ben the key.

				BEN
		Thank you.

56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
	absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
	her martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Mrs. Robinson.

	She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
	with a telephone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

	The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
	the table and hands her the receiver.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	The waiter nods and leaves.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(into phone)
		Hello.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		It's Benjamin.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Benjamin Braddock.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin -- where are you?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you look through the glass.

	Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
	glass into the lobby.

57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES

	Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
	feet away.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you see me now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I can.

58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH

	Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
	glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
	the Veranda Room.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

				BEN
		I got a single room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's fine.

				BEN
		But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
		seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
		I mean - I don't know what their policy
		is - but -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well - do you want to go up first?

				BEN
		Yes - I think that would be good.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll be up in five minutes.

				BEN
		Well - goodbye then -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Isn't there something you want to
		tell me?

				BEN
		To tell you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I want you to know how much
		I appreciate this - really -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The number.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The room number, Benjamin.  I think
		you ought to tell me that.

				BEN
		Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
		It's 512.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
		later, Mrs. Robinson.

	He hangs up.

59	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN

	He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

60	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
	to pat his breast pocket.

				BEN
		I've got it.

	The desk clerk looks up.

				BEN
		I say I've got it.

				CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

				CLERK
		Very good, sir.

				BEN
		Yes.  Well - goodnight.

				CLERK
		Goodnight, sir.

	Ben walks out of shot.

60A	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
	opens door.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
	it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
	is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
	on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
	from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
	off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
	the light.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
	through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
	opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
	purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
	mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
	finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

	He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

				BEN
		Well.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
		right?

				BEN
		Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
		stand here?  I mean - I don't know
		what you want me to do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you watch?

				BEN
		Oh - sure.  Thank you.

	She takes off her jacket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you bring me a hanger?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		A hanger.

	Ben opens the closet door.

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  Wood?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Wood or wire?  They have both.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Either one will be fine.

				BEN
		Okay.

	He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you help me with this,
		please?

	She turns her back.

				BEN
		Certainly.

	He undoes the zipper at her neck.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.

	She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would this be easier for you
		in the dark?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
		this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You what?

				BEN
		This is all terribly wrong.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
		I think you're the most attractive
		of all my parents' friends.
		I just don't think we could
		possibly --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you afraid of me?

				BEN
		No - but look - maybe we could
		do something else together,
		Mrs. Robinson - would you like
		to go to a movie.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, is this your first time?

				BEN
		Is this - what?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It is, isn't it?  It is your
		first time.

				BEN
		That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
		That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You can admit that, can't you?

				BEN
		Are you kidding?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's nothing to be ashamed of -

				BEN
		Wait a minute!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On your first time -

				BEN
		Who said it was my first time.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That you're afraid -

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		 - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
		just because you happen to be
		inadequate in one way - 

				BEN
		INADEQUATE!

	LONG pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(starting to dress)

				BEN
		Don't move.

	He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
	disappears.

	FADE IN

62	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool
	and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the
	pool.  Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds
	a beer can in one hand.

	SOUNDS:  teenagers YELLING and swimming in nearby pools;
	a radio PLAYING rock and roll; a television set TUNED to
	a ball game.

	SOUND of the back door CLOSING.  Ben opens his eyes and
	moves his head slightly.

66	WHAT HE SEES

	Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire.  Mrs.
	Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
	ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

67	SHOT - BEN

	He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
	climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
	chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
	goes through.

68	INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM

	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
	is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

	PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
	who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
	let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

	He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
	to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in
	front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt.

	He takes the cigarette out of his mouth.

69	INT. SPECIAL SET - BRADDOCK DEN AND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
	SHOT - NEW ANGLE

	We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock
	den, in which Ben is sitting.  In the dining room, Mr.
	and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking
	through the doorways toward Ben.  Ben stands, crosses back
	to the door to the den and shuts it.

70	INT. BRADDOCK DEN - NIGHT - REVERSE

	On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits.  A
	television set, facing the chair, is on.  Ben picks up a

	CLOSEUP Ben watching.  PULL BACK and we are in the Taft
	Hotel Room.  Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against
	the headboard, watching the television set which is on a
	stand facing the bed.

	SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

	PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
	from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
	half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television
	set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set.

	SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

	Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

	SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

	Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

	SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped
	closed.  Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying

	Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and
	exits.

76	INT. BENS' ROOM - CLOSEUP - BEN - DAY

	SOUND of DOOR closing.  Follow Ben as he gets up and moves

	sill.  He takes the suit and puts it on.  He moves to
	the bedroom door, opens it and goes out.

77	OMITTED

78	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	We see Mrs. Braddock in the kitchen.  Ben comes through

	Ben surfaces and, in one movememt, pulls himself up on

								CUT TO:

83	SHOT - BEN ON RAFT

				BEN
		- here - in the pool.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Why?

				BEN
		Well - it's very comfortable -
		just to drift here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Have you thought about graduate
		school?

				BEN
		No.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Would you  mind telling me then -
		what were those four years of
		college for?  What was the point
		of all that hard work?

				BEN
		You got me.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(trying unsuccessfully
			to control himself)
		Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
		a very good thing that a young
		man - after he's done some very
		good work - should have a chance
		to relax and enjoy himself, and
		lie around, and drink beer and
		so on.  But after a few weeks
		I believe that person would
		want to take some stock in him-
		self and his situation and start
		to think about getting off his
		ass.

	Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Robinson's are here.

	Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
	the sun.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
		yourself these days?

				BEN
		Oh - not too much.  Taking it
		easy.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's what I'd do if I could.
		Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
		Ben, Elaine's coming down from
		Berkeley soon.  I want you to
		call her up this time.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Because I just think you two
		would hit it off real well
		together.

	Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them.  (A long pause)

	Ben, halfway dressed to go out, in slacks, shirt and tie,
	sits in a chair.  The door opens and Mrs. Braddock enters.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Can I talk to you a minute?

				BEN
		Sure.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
		something but you don't have to
		tell me if you don't want.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well I'm going to ask you what
		you do when you go off at night.

				BEN
		When I go off?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		You don't have to tell me if
		you don't want.

				BEN
		No, I do.  I want to tell you.

	There is a pause.

				BEN
		I drive around.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What else?

				BEN
		Nothing else.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well you don't drive around from
		midnight until noon the next
		day, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh, no.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Then what do you do?  Do you
		meet someone?

				BEN
		Meet someone?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well this is your business,
		Benjamin.
			(she starts toward
			the door)
		If you -

				BEN
		No wait.  Wait.

	She stops.

				BEN
		I don't meet anyone, mother, but
		why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
		into your affairs, but I'd
		rather you didn't say anything
		at all than be dishonest.
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, wait.

	She looks at him.

				BEN
		You think I'm being dishonest?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well why do you - why do you
		think that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Because I know you don't drive
		around for twelve hours.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
		tell you what I do?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Not if you don't want to.

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But I don't want you to make
		up something.

				BEN
		I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
		proud of what I do.  I usually
		get kind of drunk.  I usually
		drive over to Los Angeles and
		go to some bars and get kind of
		drunk.  Then I take a hotel
		room.  So I won't have to drive
		home on the freeway.  I mean it
		kind of scares me to drive home
		after - 

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		You believe me, don't you?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		No.

				BEN
		You don't?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		But I want you to.  Please. Please
		will you believe me.

91	INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - SHOT - BEN

	Mrs. Robinson's hands are undoing his necktie.  Ben is
	dressed as in previous scene, plus a jacket.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.
			(he pushes her
			hand away)
		Sit down a minute.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

				BEN
		Will you please sit down a
		minute.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
	down to take off a shoe.

				BEN
		Will you leave that shoe on for
		a minute.  Please.

	She straightens up.

				BEN
		Now - do you think we could say
		a few words to each other first
		this time?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you want.

				BEN
		Good.  I mean are we dead or
		something?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I just don't think we have
		much to say to each other.

				BEN
		All we ever do is come up here
		and throw off the clothes and
		leap into bed together.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you tired of it?

				BEN
		I'm not.  No.  But do you think
		we could liven it up with a
		few words now and then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well what do you want to talk
		about?

				BEN
		Anything.  Anything at all.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to tell me about
		some of your college experiences?

				BEN
		Oh my God.

			MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best
		we can do let's just get the god-
		damn clothes off and --

	She reaches for her shoe.

				BEN
		Leave it on!  Now we are going to
		do this thing.  We are going to
		have a conversation.  Think of
		another topic.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How about art.

				BEN
		Art.  That's a good subject.
		You start it off.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You start it off.  I don't know
		anything about it.

				BEN
		Oh.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you?

				BEN
		Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
		about it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go ahead then.

				BEN
		Art.  Well what do you want to
		know about it.

	She shrugs.

				BEN
		Are you interested more in modern
		art or more in classical art.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Neither.

				BEN
		You're not interested in art?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Then why do you want to talk
		about it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

	Ben nods and looks at the rug.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I take off my clothes now?

				BEN
		No.  Think of another topic.
		Tell me what you did today.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you really want me to?

				BEN
		Yes I do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.

	Ben starts shaking his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to hear it or not?

				BEN
		Yes.  But you might try and spice
		it up with a little originality.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.  I ate breakfast and
		went shopping.  During the after-
		noon I read a novel.

				BEN
		What one.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		What novel did you read.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't remember.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then I fixed supper for my husband
		and waited until -

				BEN
		There!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
		There's something we could have
		a conversation about.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Him?

				BEN
		I mean everything.  I don't know
		anything about how you - how you
		work this.  I don't know how you
		get out of the house at night.  I
		don't know the risk involved.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There isn't any.

				BEN
		There's no risk?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		How do you get out of the house?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I walk out.

				BEN
		You walk right out the door.

	She nods.

				BEN
		What do you say to him?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He's asleep.

				BEN
		Always?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, this isn't a very
		interesting topic.

				BEN
		Please.  Now tell me.  How do
		you know he won't wake up
		sometime and follow you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because he takes sleeping pills.
		He takes three sleeping pills
		every night at ten o'clock.

				BEN
		But what about the noise from
		the car.  What if -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The driveway's on my side of
		the house.

				BEN
			(smiling)
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Calm down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Now let's keep going here.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I undress and talk at the
		same time?

				BEN
		Right.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Now.  You say the driveway's on
		your side of the house.  So I
		guess you don't sleep in the
		same room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We don't.

				BEN
		So you don't - I mean I don't
		like to seem like I'm prying
		but I guess you don't sleep
		together or anything.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No we don't.

				BEN
		Well how long has this been going
		on.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at the
			ceiling for a moment)
		About five years.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		You have not slept with your
		husband for five years?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Now and then.  He geats drunk a
		few times a year.

				BEN
		How many times a year.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
		his birthday.

				BEN
		Man, is this interesting.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		So you don't love him.  You
		wouldn't say you -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We've talked enough, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
		say you loved him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not exactly.

				BEN
		But you don't hate him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
		Unhook my blouse.

				BEN
			(unhooking her blouse)
		Well how do you feel about him,
		then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

				BEN
		Well that's kind of a bad
		situation then, isn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		I mean it doesn't sound like it
		could be much worse.  If you
		hated him at least you'd hate
		him.

	She nods and takes off her blouse.

				BEN
		Well you loved him once, I
		assume.  When you first knew
		him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I never did, Benjamin.  Now
		let's -

				BEN
		Well, wait a minute.  You married
		him.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you do that?

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(taking off her
			stockings)
		See if you can guess.

				BEN
		Well I can't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Think real hard, Benjamin.

				BEN
		I can't see why you did, unless
		...you didn't have to marry him
		or anything, did you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't tell Elaine.

				BEN
		Oh no.  You had to marry him
		because you got pregnant?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you shocked?

				BEN
		Well I never thought of you and
		Mr. Robinson as the kind of
		people who...

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now let's get to bed.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
		So how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean do you feel like telling
		me what were the circumstances?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not particularly.

				BEN
		Was he a law student at the time?

	She nods.

				BEN
		And you were a student also.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		At college.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		What was your major?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why are you asking me all this?

				BEN
		Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
		Now what was your major subject
		at college?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Art.

				BEN
		Art?

	She nods.

				BEN
		But I thought you - I guess you
		kind of lost interest in it over
		the years then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Kind of.

				BEN
		Well how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How do you think.

				BEN
		I mean did he take you up to
		his room with him?  Did you go
		to a hotel?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, what does it possibly
		matter?

				BEN
		I'm curious.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'd go to his car.

				BEN
		Oh no.  In the car you did it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't think we were the first.

	Ben thinks for a moment.

				BEN
		What kind of car was it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Do you remember the make of the
		car?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh my God.

				BEN
		Really.  I want to know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It was a Ford, Benjamin.

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
		Ford!  That's great!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's enough.

				BEN
		So old Elaine Robinson got started
		in a Ford.

	There is a pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't talk about Elaine.

				BEN
		Don't talk about Elaine?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't want you to.

	She walks to the bed.

				BEN
		Well why don't you?

	She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
	jacket.

				BEN
		I wish you'd tell me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There's nothing to tell.

				BEN
		Well why is she a big taboo
		subject all of a sudden?

	Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

				BEN
		Well - I guess I'll have to ask
		her out on a date and find out
		what's --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, don't you ever take
		that girl out.

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand that?

				BEN
		Well look.  I have no intention
		of taking her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		I was just kidding around.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		But why shouldn't I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I have my reasons.

				BEN
		Then let's hear them.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
		Robinson.  Because I think I
		know what they are.

	She pulls the covers down.

				BEN
		I'm not good enough for her to
		associate with, am I?  I'm not
		good enough to even talk about
		her, am I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Let's drop it.

				BEN
		We're not dropping it.  Now
		that's the reason, isn't it?
		I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
		I?  I'm not fit to -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		I'm good enough for you but I'm
		too slimy to associate with
		your daughter.  That's it, isn't
		it?  ISN'T IT?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		You go to hell.  You go straight
		to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
		think I'm proud of myself?  Do
		you think I'm proud of this?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I wouldn't know.

				BEN
		Well, I'm not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You're not.

				BEN
		No sir.  I am not proud that I
		spend my time with a broken-
		down alcoholic!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I see.

				BEN
		And if you think I come here
		for any reason besides pure
		boredom, then you're all wrong.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Because - Mrs. Robinson this
		is the sickest, most perverted
		thing that ever happened to
		me.  And you do what you want
		but I'm getting the hell out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you?

				BEN
		You're goddamn right I am.

	He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
	the bed and watches him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's how you feel about me.

	He nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That I'm a sick and disgusting
		person.

				BEN
		Now don't start this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Don't start acting hurt.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you expect me to be a
		little hurt?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
		and tell me I'm not good enough
		for your daughter.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did I say that?

				BEN
		Of course you did.

	She shakes her head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to apologize
		to you if that's the impression
		you got.

				BEN
		Well two minutes ago you told
		me I wasn't good enough for
		your daughter.  Now you say
		you're sorry I got that
		impression.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I didn't mean it.  I don't think
		you'd be right for each other.
		But I would never say you
		weren't as good a person as
		she is.

				BEN
		You wouldn't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Of course I wouldn't.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

				BEN
		What are you doing?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well it's pretty obvious you
		don't want me around any more.

				BEN
		Well look - I was kind of upset
		there.  I'm sorry I said those
		things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If that's how you feel -

				BEN
		But it's not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(smiling at him)
		That's all right.  I think I
		can understand why I'm disgusting
		to you.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
		wouldn't keep coming here if
		I didn't like you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But if it's sickening for you -

				BEN
		It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
		forward to it.  It's the one
		thing I have to look forward
		to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to say that.

				BEN
		Well I wouldn't.  I would never
		say it if it wasn't true.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I stay then?

				BEN
		Yes. Please.  I want you to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Well don't thank me, because I
		want you to.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But you won't ever take out
		Elaine, will you?  I want you
		to promise me that.

	There is another long pause.

				BEN
		Look.  Why the hell did you
		bring this up.  It never
		occured to me to take her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then give me your word you won't.

				BEN
		This is absurd.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Promise me, Benjamin.

				BEN
		All right, for christ's sake.
		I promise I will never take
		out Elaine Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.
			(pause)
		Benjamin -

				BEN
		Let's not talk about it.  Let's
		not talk at all.

	At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
	other, they begin to take off their clothes.

								FADE OUT

	FADE IN

92	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
	at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
	are there.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Elaine's back from school.  I
		think it might be a nice gesture
		if you asked her out.

	Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
	eating and reading.

								CUT TO:

93	INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
	doorway.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't you think that she's a
		terribly attractive girl?
		Because I think she's one of
		the prettiest girls I've
		ever seen.

	Ben gives a small whimper.

								CUT TO:

94	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
	Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
	is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
	down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
	in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
	Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
	swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
	their heads above the surface.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		It's pretty embarrassing.  I
		really don't know what to tell
		Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
		and strained for me every time
		he suggests that you call up
		Elaine.

				BEN
		Next time he suggests it,
		I'll tell him I have no
		intention of ever calling
		her up in my life.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess she's not good enough
		for you, is that it?

				BEN
		Look - Elaine Robinson and I
		do not get along.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		How do you know?  You haven't
		seen her since high school.  I
		guess your evenings, whatever
		you do with them, are just too
		valuable.

				BEN
		That has nothing to do with it -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
		that you're just too busy every
		evening - doing God knows what -

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't go on like this.  Now if
		Benjamin absolutely refuses to
		take her out -

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		- then I'll simply invite all the
		Robinsons' over for dinner on
		Thursday.

95	SHOT - BEN

	He slides off the raft and goes underwater.

96	SHOT - BEN UNDERWATER

	His hair streaming up, his eyes open.

							CUT TO:

97	INT. SPECIAL SET BRADDOCK DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
	table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
	the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
	back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
	facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
	the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
	eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
	Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
	continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
	Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

							CUT TO:

98	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the
	pool.

				BEN
		I'll go call Elaine now.

	Mr. and Mrs. Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and
	try to smile at each other.

	SOUND:  Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.

							CUT TO:

99	EXT. & INT. ROBINSON FRONT DOOR, HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

	The door opens.  Mr. Robinson stands there with a huge
	smile.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Braddock - it's about
		time you got around to this.
		Come on in.  I'm afraid the
		young lady isn't quite ready
		yet -

	Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
	sitting there.

				BEN
		Hello.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What would you say to a short one?
		Bourbon still your drink?

				BEN
		Yes.

	Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I'll see if she's ready.

	Mr. Robinson exits.

	Mr. Robinson and ELAINE enter.

				ELAINE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Hello.

101	CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Well - I want you to keep your
		wits about you tonight.  You never
		know what tricks Ben picked up
		back there in the East.

							LAP DISSOLVE TO:

102	EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
	leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
	and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

				ELAINE
		You're living at home now.  Is
		that right?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		Do you know what you're going
		to do?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Are you going to graduate school?

				BEN
		No.

	He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
	does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
	right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
	down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
	driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
	Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

				ELAINE
		Do you always drive like this?

				BEN
		Yes.

								CUT TO:

103	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS.
	Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.

				BEN
		Do you want some dinner?

				ELAINE
		I'd love some.

	A waiter moves forward toward them.

				BEN
		Bring a menu.

				WAITER #2
		Dinner for two, sir?

				BEN
		No.  Just for her.

	The waiter moves away.

				ELAINE
		Aren't you eating?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Why not?

				BEN
		If it's all right with you,
		I'm not hungry.

	The waiter returns with a menu.

				ELAINE
		I've changed my mind.  Thank
		you.

								CUT TO:

104	EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS

	Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

105	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
	entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
	who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
	he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
	Elaine is just behind him.

								CUT TO:

106	INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
	them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
	on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
	dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
	its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
	the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
	unsure.

				BEN
		Sit down.

	Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
	Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
	puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
	each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
	looking directly at Elaine.

				BEN
		Why don't you watch the show?

	The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - do you dislike me
		for some reason?

				BEN
		No - why should I?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

107	SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER

	She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
	twirling the tassels.

				BEN
		You're missing a great effect
		here.

	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
	back.

				BEN
		How do you like that?

	Elaine doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Could you do it?

				ELAINE
		No.

	The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
	Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
	walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

	The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
	spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
	face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
	her eyes.

	The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
	and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
	DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
	and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
	front of Elaine's face.

108	SHOT - BEN

	He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
	swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

	The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
	swing more frantically.

109	SHOT - ELAINE

	She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

110	SHOT - BEN

	With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

111	SHOT - ELAINE

	Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
	fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
	of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

112	SHOT - BEN

	He reaches up to remove the glasses.

113	SHOT - ELAINE

	As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
	spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
	her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
	at Ben.

114	SHOT - BEN

	With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
	and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

				STRIPPER
		Hey!

	Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
	Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

								CUT TO:

115	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
	bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
	is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
	her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
	catches her and holds her arm.

				BEN
		Elaine - I'm sorry.

	Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
	her arm away.

				ELAINE
		Will you take me home now?

				BEN
		I'm sorry I took you in there.

				ELAINE
		I think I'd better go home now
		please.

				BEN
		But, Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Where is the car?

				BEN
		I just want to tell you something.

	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
	to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

				ELAINE
		I want to go home.

				BEN
		But could I just tell you this
		one thing?

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		This whole idea - this date
		and everything.  It was my
		parents' idea.  They forced me
		into it.

				ELAINE
		Oh - that's very nice of
		you to tell me.

				BEN
		No.  What I mean is - that's
		why I've been acting this way.
		I'm not like this.  I hate
		myself like this.

	She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
	them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
	them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

				BEN
		Listen - could you stop crying,
		please?

				ELAINE
		No, I couldn't.

				BEN
		But could you try?

				ELAINE
		No.

	She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
	for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
	takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
	her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
	little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
	her eyes.

	He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
	of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
	her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
	on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
	to one side.

				BEN
		Elaine -

	He starts to pull her head back.

				ELAINE
		Not here.  Not here.

							DISSOLVE TO:

116	EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
	restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
	side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
	furiously.

				BEN
		I've had this feeling - ever
		since I've graduated - this -
		kind of compulsion that I have
		to be rude all the time.  Do
		you know what I mean?

				ELAINE
		Yes, I do.

	He looks at her.

				BEN
		It's like I've been playing
		some kind of - game - but the
		rules don't make any sense to
		me -

	She is watching him carefully.

				BEN
		- they're being made up by all
		the wrong people - no - I mean
		no one makes them up, they seem
		to have made themselves up.

	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
	slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
	and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
	across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
	kid behind the wheel.

				BEN
		Say - I wonder if I could request
		you to turn that down a little?

	The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
	windows up.

117	SERIES OF SHOTS

	From outside of car.  Ben is talking with great animation
	- Elaine is watching him.  They are both eating as Ben
	talks, telling Elaine a story.  Their windows are rolled
	up.

	SOUNDS: Cars GUNNING their ENGINES; horns HONKING;
	radios PLAYING; waitresses YELLING orders; customers
	YELLING at waitresses; kids LAUGHING and TALKING from
	car to car; MOTORCYCLES driving in and out, TRAFFIC.

								CUT TO:

118	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson
	house.  The RADIO plays QUIETLY.  Ben turns it OFF.  They
	sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's
	hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

				ELAINE
		Well - maybe I'd better go in.

	He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
	moment.

				ELAINE
		Would you like to come in?  I
		could make some coffee.

				BEN
		No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
		wake anyone up.

				ELAINE
		We won't.  Let's go inside.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				ELAINE
		Is anything wrong?

				BEN
		No - I was just thinking -
		look - it's still early -
		we could do something - go
		somewhere else.

				ELAINE
		All right.

	He starts the car immediately and drives away from the
	house.

119	INT. BEN'S CAR - NIGHT

	Ben is driving.

				ELAINE
		Where we going?

				BEN
		I'm trying to think of where
		there's a place to have a
		drink around here.

				ELAINE
		Isn't there one in the Taft

	There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off
	the road.

				ELAINE
		What is the matter?

				BEN
		Nothing.  I'm just wondering if

		let's go see.  Let's go see if
		they do or not.

120	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside
	the door.  They start in a few steps.

				BEN
		Listen, Elaine - it seems to me
		that there isn't a bar in here.
		I mean - as far as I know.

				ELAINE
		Of course there is.  Look -
		The Veranda Room - right there.

	ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out.

				CAR PARKER
		Good evening.

	CAMERS BEGINS TO PULL UP AND AWAY.  A BELLBOY passes
	them.

				BELLBOY
		Hello, how are you, sir?

	The room clerk smiles at them.

				ROOM CLERK
		Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

	Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the
	lobby.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT
	revealing many people moving back and forth in the
	lobby, passing Ben and Elaine.

				VOICE #1
		Hello again.

				VOICE #2
		Hi, Mr. Gladstone.  How are you

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - do they know you?

				BEN
		Of course not.

				VOICE #3
		Good evening, sir.

	He moves her toward the door.

				ELAINE
		Ben - what's happening?  Who

				BEN
		I don't know.  They must think
		I look like this guy Gladstone.

	PAN WITH THEM as they start down the steps.  Coming up
	the steps toward them is Miss DeWitte, on the arm of
	another ELDERLY LADY.

				MISS DeWITTE
		Hello, Mr. Brannif.

	SOUND:  Car STARTING noisily.

122	EXT. TAFT HOTEL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off
	the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car
	speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
	turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
	head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

				BEN
		Elaine - I like you.  I like you
		so much.  Do you believe that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Do you?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		You're the first - you're the
		first thing for so long that
		I've liked.  The first person
		I could stand to be with.

	She takes his hand.

				BEN
		I mean my whole life is such a
		waste.  It's just nothing.  I'm
		sorry.  I'll take you home now.

	He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - are having an
		affair with someone?

	He freezes with his hand still on the key.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.

	He turns off the engine.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.  That is not my
		business.

				BEN
		It just happened.  It was just
		this thing that happened along
		with everything else.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				ELAINE
		Was she married or something?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		With a family?

				BEN
		Yes.  She had a husband and a
		son.

				ELAINE
		Did they ever find out?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		And it's all over now.

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		I'm glad.

	He starts the car and drives out.

		During the day?  We'll go for

				ELAINE
		Okay.

				BEN
		You sure you really want to?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Because I wouldn't want you to

	SHOT - INT. BEN'S CAR - BEN DRIVING

	It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
	From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
	Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
	playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
	Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
	of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
	dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
	reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
	and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drive down the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I have a date
		with Elaine.  We're going for
		a drive.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at him
			for the first time)
		Do exactly what I say.

	Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.

125	ANOTHER ANGLE - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

	As they drive.

				BEN
		Now it seems to me -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Listen to me very carefully,
		Benjamin.  You are not to see
		Elaine again.  Ever.  Those
		are my orders.  Is that clear?

	Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down
	the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I can makes things quite unpleasant.

				BEN
		How?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In order to keep Elaine away
		from you - I am prepared to
		tell her everything.

				BEN
		I don't believe you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then you'd better start believing me.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it.  I'm
		asking you please not to wreck it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go home now.

				BEN
		I just don't believe you would do that.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Try me.

	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
	he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
	his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

	TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
	way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front
	door.

	Ben runs in.

		I'm not dressed yet.

	Ben runs up the stairs.  He still carries the package.
	Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door
	to her bedroom.  She is wearing a skirt and slip and
	carrying one shoe.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed -

	Ben pushes her back into her room.

		Hurry up.  Put your shoes on.

	Ben turns and looks.

128	SHOT - OVER BEN'S SHOULDER

	Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

				BEN
		NO.

	He turns around.

129	NEW ANGLE

	Elaine is standing in the doorway watching him.  She
	still holds the shoe in her hand.

				BEN
		Why aren't you ready?

		Because I want to know what's
		happening.

	SOUND of Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS in the hall below.

				BEN
		There isn't time!

130	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
	in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
	they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
	can be heard coming up the stairs.

				BEN
		Elaine - I have to tell you
		something.

	He holds her against the wall in the corner.

				ELAINE
		What is it?

				BEN
		That woman -

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		That woman.  The older woman.

				ELAINE
		You mean the one who -

				BEN
		Yes.  The married woman - it
		wasn't just some woman -

	Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the
	hall.

				ELAINE
		What are you telling me?

	The FOOTSTEPS stop.

131	ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE

	Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
	crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
	Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
	mother's eyes staring.

				ELAINE
		Please - will somebody tell me -

	She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
	Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
	door.  Elaine looks away.

				ELAINE
		Oh - no.

	Ben backs up.

				BEN
		Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Oh my God -

	Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
	as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

				BEN
		Please.

	Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
	then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
	of her eyes.

				BEN
		No - don't cry -

				ELAINE
		GET OUT!

				BEN
		Don't cry.
			(holds the package
			out to her)

				ELAINE
		Get out of here.

	She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into
	the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut.

				ELAINE
			(holding the door)
		Get out!

132	INT. ROBINSON HALL - DAY

	Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben.

	his chest.

	Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his

140	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	It is early morning.  We see a swinging door pushed open
	to reveal:  Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing
	at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can
	see an orange tree.  Mr. Braddock is pouring orange juice
	from a MINUTE MAID container.  Ben stands inside door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Say that again.

				BEN
		I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

	MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Well - well - well -

	He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand
	to shake it.  Mrs. Braddock appears in the doorway.  Ben
	is shaking his father's hand.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What's happening?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben says he and Elaine are getting
		married.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		I don't believe it.

				MR. BRADDOCK

				BEN
		I'm going up to Berkeley today.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
		We've got something to celebrate.

				BEN
		No.  I think you'll want to wait
		on that.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They don't know?

				BEN
		No - they don't.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well - when did you decide all
		this?

				BEN
		About an hour ago.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Wait a minute.  You talked to
		Elaine this morning?

				BEN
		No.  She doesn't know about it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		She doesn't know that you're
		coming up to Berkeley?

				BEN
		No.  Actually - she doesn't
		know about us getting married
		yet.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		When did you two talk this over?

				BEN
		We haven't.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben - this whole idea sounds
		pretty half-baked.

				BEN
		No - it's not.  It's completely
		baked.  It's a decision I've made.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But what makes you think she
		wants to marry you?

	Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.

				BEN
		She doesn't.  To be perfectly

	outside animal cages.  Ben is walking a step or two behind
	Elaine.  He is darting glances to the right and left.

				BEN
		Is that him over there?

				ELAINE
		No.

				BEN
		Where did he say he was going
		to meet you?

				ELAINE
		I thought he said by the monkey
		house.

				BEN
		Oh.

	She stops.  Ben stops.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I would like to know
		what you're doing here.

				BEN
		Here?  In Berkelely?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, I have this very pleasant
		room on Carter Street - and I've
		been getting to some classes -

				ELAINE
		But you're not enrolled.

				BEN
		No.  I just sit in.  They don't
		seem to mind.  They've been
		very congenial about it.

	She looks at him and starts to shake her head.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - you're - I don't
		know what to say - you're --

				BEN
		Maybe we could get together
		some time and talk about it.

				ELAINE
		- really incredible -

				BEN
		Here he comes.

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		I've got a real feeling that
		this is the fellow.

	Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
	briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

				CARL
			(waving)
		Elaine!

				BEN
		He certainly is a good walker.

	Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
	mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
	takes Elaine's hands.

				CARL
		Am I late?  I'm sorry.

				BEN
		We thought you said by the
		monkey house.

	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
	Ben smiles.

				ELAINE
		This is Benjamin Braddock.
		Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode
		here with me on the bus.

				CARL
		Glad to meet you, Ben.

	Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

				BEN
		Great meeting you, Carl.

	Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
	The three of them look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Swell seeing you.  Have a good
		time.

	Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
	and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
	stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
	cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
	at:

177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE

	Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
	gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

178	SHOT - BEN

	As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
	The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
	his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
	cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
	look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
	with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
	to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

							DISSOLVE TO:

179	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben is standing by the window, looking out.

180	EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - STREET - DAY
	SHOT - THROUGH THE WINDOW

	Elaine is walking up the street toward the rooming house.

181	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY - SHOT - BEN

	He jumps to the other side of the window and peers out
	carefully.

182	EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - STREET - DAY - SHOT - THROUGH THE
	WINDOW

	Elaine turns in and disappears into the rooming house
	front door below.

183	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM AND HALLWAY - DAY - SHOT
	BEN

	He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
	He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
	crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
	to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
	takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
	sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
	is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
	bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
	He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
	to straighten it out with the iron.

	There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
	back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
	then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
	on his lap.

				BEN
		Come in.

	There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens
	it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

				ELAINE
		I want to ask you a question.

				BEN
		Come in.

				ELAINE
		No.  I want to know why you're
		here in Berkeley?

				BEN
		Because - I am.

				ELAINE
		Is it because I'm here?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				ELAINE
		I think it is.

	Ben nods.

				ELAINE
		I said I think it is.

				BEN
		All right then!  Yes!

				ELAINE
		Well, I want you to leave.

				BEN
		Elaine - I love you.

				ELAINE
			(looking down)
		How could you do that, Benjamin?

	Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

				ELAINE
		Do you just hate everything?
		How could you possibly rape
		my...

				BEN
		What?

				ELAINE
		I don't understand -

				BEN
		Did you say rape her?

				ELAINE
		- how you - how anyone - could
		do a thing like that.

				BEN
		What did she say?

				ELAINE
			(holding his arm)
		Let me go.

				BEN
		You've got to tell me what she
		said.

	He touches her hair.

				ELAINE
		Why?

				BEN
		Because it isn't true.

				ELAINE
		I don't feel well.

	Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
	along side her.

				BEN
		Tell me.

	Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

				ELAINE
		She said she was having a drink
		in the hotel with a friend.
		You waited for her in the parking
		lot and told her she was too
		drunk to drive home and that
		you would get her a room for
		the night.

				BEN
		Then what?

				ELAINE
		Then you took her upstairs and
		you raped her.

				BEN
		Elaine - that is not what happened.

	She puts her hands on his shoulder.

				ELAINE
		Please let me go.

				BEN
		All right - but listen to me.
		What happened was there was
		this party at my parents.  I
		drove your mother home - then
		we went upstairs to see your
		portrait -

	Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

				ELAINE
		Don't tell me -

				BEN
		- and when we got up in the
		room she starts taking her her
		clothes off - and -

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - this is my mother!

				BEN
		- suddenly there she was without
		any clothes on - I mean really
		naked -

	Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
	long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
	the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
	water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
	door.

	SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
	Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
	from a hanger and puts it on.

	SOUND:  A KNOCK on the door.

				MR. McCLEERY'S VOICE
		What's going on in there?

	Elaine sits up and drinks the water.  Ben looks at
	her then goes to the door and opens it.

				BEN
		Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Who screamed?

				BEN
		It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Screaming isn't all right.  Not
		in my house it isn't.

				BEN
		It was just a visitor.  But it's
		all right now.

	Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see
	into the room.  Ben edges through the door into the
	hallway.

184	INT. ROOMING HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

				MR. McCLEERY
		What did you do to her?

				BEN
		Look - she's all right.  She's
		upset and she screamed.  But
		she's okay now.

				A BOY
		Shall I get the cops?

				BEN
		What?

				A BOY
		I'll get the cops.

	He starts for the stairs.

				BEN
		Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
		it - look.

	He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

				BEN
		See - she's just having some
		water.  Now there's no need
		for the cops or anything.

				MR. McCLEERY
		All right, boys - I think you
		can get back to your rooms.  I
		don't think we'll have any more
		of this agitation.  Will we,
		Braddock?

				BEN
		No, sir.

	The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
	stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

				MR. McCLEERY
		I want you out of here.

	Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
	down the stairs.

				BEN
		Mr. McCleery?

				MR. McCLEERY
		You heard me.  Out of here.

				BEN
		What for?

				MR. McCLEERY
			(going down the
			stairs)
		Because I don't like you.

	Mr. McCleery disappears down the stairs.  Ben turns and
	goes back into the room.

185	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Elaine is standing at the sink.  She is putting water on
	her face.  Ben goes to the closet and takes out his suit-
	case and carries it to the bed.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry I screamed.

	Ben opens the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin, when you came up here,
		what did you think was going to
		happen between us?

				BEN
		Elaine - right now I don't feel
		like talking much.  I'm sorry
		about everything but I think I'll
		just do this now.

	He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Can I just sit here while you're
		packing?

				BEN
		If you want.

	Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
	the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
	in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
	down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

				ELAINE
		What are you looking for?

				BEN
		My belt.

				ELAINE
		Don't you have it on?

				BEN
		No.  I have two.  The other one
		is the one I'm looking for.
			(he reaches under
			the bureau)
		What's this?
			(he brings out a
			marble)
		It's from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		The marble?

				BEN
		The belt I'm looking for was
		from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		Oh.

	Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

				ELAINE
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I don't know.

	He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
	and carries them to the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Are you going home?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Well - where are you going?

	He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
	some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the
	suitcase.

				BEN
		Elaine - you're going to have to
		stop asking me that.

	He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to
	the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some
	ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine
	gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

				BEN
		I don't understand.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to go anywhere
		until you have a definite plan.

				BEN
		But Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Goodbye.

	She walks out, shutting the door behind her.  He crosses
	to the window.

185A	EXT. ROOMING HOUSE STREET - DAY

	Past Ben, through the window, we see Elaine walking away.
	She walks the length of the street and disappears.

	Ben asleep in his bed.  Suddenly he sits up.

187	SHOT - ELAINE

	Standing in the darkness by the door.

				BEN
		What's happening?

	He gets out of the bed.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		What?

				ELAINE
			(taking a step
			forward)
		Will you kiss me!

	He goes to her and they kiss.

				BEN
		Will you marry me?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		You won't?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		But you might.

				ELAINE
		I might.

				BEN
		Is that so?  You might marry me?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		When?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		How about tomorrow?  I don't mean
		to be pushy but -

				ELAINE
		I don't know.  I don't know what's
		happening.

				BEN
		You mean you're confused?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well - look - don't be confused.
		We're getting married.

				ELAINE
		I don't see how we can.

				BEN
		We just can.

				ELAINE
		I have to go back now.

	She goes to the door.

				BEN
		Elaine - are you serious about this?

				ELAINE
		I'll think about it.

				BEN
		You really will?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

	She opens the door and steps into the hall.  He goes to the
	door.

				BEN
		Well - let's get together sometime.

	He closes the door.

		Good God!

				BEN
		Tomorrow then - can we get our

	She turns and looks at him.

				ELAINE
		Why don't you just drag me off

				BEN
		Why don't I just drag you

		Right after we get the blood

				ELAINE

				BEN
		Carl who?

	Elaine jumps up, applauding a shot.

				BEN
		Carl who?

		on his knees, I hope.

				ELAINE
		No, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

				ELAINE
		He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

				BEN
		Oh no.  He said that.

		Shhhh.

	She goes through the doorway into Wendell Hall.  Ben remains
	standing in exactly the same positin.  After a few moments
	the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben,
	kisses him, then runs back inside.  Ben turns and starts
	away from the door.  The door opens again.  Ben turns back
	and takes a step toward the door, smiling expectantly.  A

	pause.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(clearing his throat)
		Do you want - do you want to try
		and tell me why you did it?

				BEN
		Mr. Robinson?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you have a special grudge
		against me?  Do you feel a particularly
		strong resentment for me?

				BEN
		No, it's not --

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is there something I've said that's
		caused this contempt?  Or is it just
		the things I stand for that you
		despise?

				BEN
		It was nothing to do with you, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to
		do with me.

	Ben takes a step forward.

				BEN
		Now look - please -

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, I think we're two civilized
		human beings.  Do you think it's
		necessary to threaten each other?

				BEN
		I am not threatening you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you want to unclench your fists,
		please?  Thank you.  I can see in
		the dark, you know.  I've been here
		quite a while.

				BEN
		I am trying to tell you I have no
		personal feelings about you, Mr.
		Robinson.  I am trying to tell
		you I do not resent you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You don't respect me terribly
		much either, do you?

				BEN
		No, I don't.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, I don't think we have a
		whole lot to say to each other,
		Ben.  I do think you should know
		the consequences of what you've
		done.  I do think you should
		know that my wife and I are
		getting a divorce soon.

				BEN
		But why?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Why?

				BEN
		It shouldn't make any difference
		what happened.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's quite a statement.

				BEN
		Listen to me.  We got - we got
		into bed with each other.  But
		it was nothing.  It was nothing
		at all.  We might - we might just
		as well have been shaking hands.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Shaking hands.  Well, that's not
		saying much for my wife, is it?

				BEN
		You miss the point.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Don't shout at me, Ben.

				BEN
		The point is - I don't love your
		wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well - I'm sure you think you do,
		Ben, but after a few times in
		bed with Elaine I feel quite sure
		you'd get over that as quickly
		as you -

				BEN
		HUH?

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think I've talked about this
		enough.  I don't know how far
		I can go, Ben.  I don't know if
		I can prosecute or not, but I
		think maybe I can.  In the light
		of what's happened I think maybe
		I can get you behind bars if you
		ever look at my daughter again.
		I have seen Elaine and I have
		spent the afternoon taking steps
		to insure...

	Mr. Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door.
	Ben takes a step toward him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Stay away from me, Ben!

	Mr. Robinson stands at the door.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I don't want to mince words with
		you.  As far as Elaine's concerned
		you're to get her out of your
		filthy mind right now.  Is that
		perfectly clear ro you?  That's
		all, Ben.  You'll pardon me if
		I don't shake hands with you.

	Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are filth.

	Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are scum.

	Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs.  Mr. McCleery is

		Could I make one phone call first?

	As Ben moves further into the room, Mrs. Robinson, carrying

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello.  Get me the police, please.

				BEN
		Where is Elaine?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll be with you in a moment,
		Benjamin.
			(into phone)
		Will you send a police car to twelve

		ask him.
			(to Ben)
		Are you armed?
			(into phone)
		No - I don't believe he is.  Thank
		you.

	She hangs up.

				BEN
		What have you done to her?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I think we have everything quite
		under control now, Benjamin.  Would
		you like a quick drink before you go?

	She picks up a glass from the night table and takes a
	drink.

				BEN
		You can't stop me from seeing her,
		Mrs. Robinson.  I'll find her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'm sorry we won't be able to invite
		you to the wedding, Benjamin, but
		the arrangements have been so rushed -

				BEN
		What the hell have you done?

	SOUND of SEVERAL CARS TURNING INTO DRIVEWAY.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Ahh.  I don't think you'll have
		time for that drink after all.

				BEN
		I'll find her.

	People are YELLING as him from the cars going by.

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Carl - I think you and Elaine will
		make a good team.

				FRAT BROTHER #1
		He took off in the middle of the
		night to get married.

	He goes back to his breakfast.

				FRAT BROTHER #2

				FRAT BROTHER #2
		Why don't you ask Carter?

				BEN
		Would you happen to know where I

				FRAT BROTHER #2
		He's probably still in the sack.
		He's always in the sack.

	They start to laugh.

1	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
	SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 

	Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
	see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
	As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
	and PHRASES as though from a public address system.

2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN

	in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is
	BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading.

3	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY

	Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there.

4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY

				BEN
		- and today it is right that we
		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge
		that I shall endeavor to carry it
		with me forever.

5	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	The audience is gone.

15	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN

	us through the air.

16	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE

		Ladies and gentlemen, we are about

	SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.

								CUT TO:

17	INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT

	His eyes open suddenly.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE
		The sound you have just heard is the
		landing gear locking into place.  The
		Los Angeles weather is clear and the
		temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do
		not expect any traffic delay and will
		make our four hour and eighteen minute
		flight plan smack on the nose.  We
		enjoyed having you on board and look
		forward to seeing you again in the near
		future.

18	SHOT

	PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with
	snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the
	ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them.

19	REVERSE ANGLE

	Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every
	direction.

	SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH.

	START OF MAIN TITLES

	UNDER titles:

				STEWARDESS' VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your

21	INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK - NIGHT

	Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk.

28	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
	There are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
	in other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
	while, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
	of the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
	can be heard among them.

				MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE

		-- associate editor of the college
		newspaper in his junior year - 
		managing editor in his senior
		year -

	The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
	the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
	VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
	remainder of the sequence.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
	being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
	falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
	SNAPPED OFF.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What's the matter?

	Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		The guests are all downstairs,
		Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

				BEN
		Look, Dad - could you explain to
		them that I have to be alone for
		a while?

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		These are all our good friends,
		Ben.  Most of them have known you
		since - well - practically since
		you were born.

	Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
	as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What is it, Ben?

	The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

				BEN
		I'm just - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- worried?

				BEN
		Well - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		About what?

				Ben
		I guess - about my future.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		What about it?

				BEN
		I don't know.  I want it to be -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		To be what?

				BEN
			(quietly)
		Different.

	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
	MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Is anything wrong?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		No!  No - we're just on our way
		downstairs!

	Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
	picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Carlsons' are here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to Mrs. Braddock)
		They are?
			(to Ben)
		Come on.

	Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They came all the way from
		Tarzana.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		It's a wonderful thing to have
		so many devoted friends.

	They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
	Braddocks are moving down.

				MR. CARLSON
		Hey - there's our award winning
		scholar.

				MRS. CARLSON
		We're all very proud of you,
		Ben.

				BEN
		Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

				MR. CARLSON
		Is that the new car out there?
		The little red Wop job?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That's Ben's graduation present.

				MR. CARLSON
			(putting his arm
			across Ben's shoulder)
		Won't have much trouble picking
		them up in that, will you?

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. CARLSON
		The girls.  The chicks.  The -
		the teeny boppers.

				MRS. CARLSON
		I think Ben has gotten beyond
		the teeny bopper stage - haven't
		you, Ben?

	Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
	and return the wink politely.

				BEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

				BEN
		Excuse me - I think I'd just
		like to check something on
		the car for a minute -

	Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
	steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Here's the track star himself.
		How are you, track star?

				BEN
		Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

	Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
	hall.

				MR. LOOMIS
		I want to get a drink and then
		I want to hear all about that
		thing you won.  That Hopperman
		award.

				BEN
		Helpingham.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
		wait right here.

	Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
	moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
	the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
	lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

				LADY 1
		Ben - we're all so proud of
		you.

				LADY 2
		Proud, proud, proud, proud,
		proud.

				LADY 3
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I was going to go upstairs for a
		minute -

				LADY 3
		No - I meant with your future.

				LADY 2
		With your life.

				BEN
		Well - that's a little hard to say -

	MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben!

				Ben
			(to the ladies)
		Excuse me.
			(he turns around)
		Mr. McQuire

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(overwhelmed with pride)
		Ben.

				BEN
		Mr. McQuire.

	Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
	toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
	TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben - I just want to say one word to
		you - just one word -

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Are you listening?

				BEN
		Yes I am.

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(gravely)
		Plastics.

	They look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Exactly how do you mean?

				MR. MCQUIRE
		There is a great future in plastics.
		Think about it.  Will you think
		about it?

				BEN
		Yes, I will.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

	Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
	people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

				WOMAN #1
		Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

				BEN
		Excuse me just a minute -

	Ben goes into the house through the back door.

31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
	way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
	goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

	SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
	PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
	window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

	Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
	OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh.  I guess this isn't the
		bathroom, is it?

				BEN
		It's down the hall.

	They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you, Benjamin?

				BEN
		Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
		down at the end of the hall.

	Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
	of the bed.

				BEN
		Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
		mean to be rude but -

	Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
	lights it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is there an ashtray in here?

				BEN
		No.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh - I forgot.  The track star
		doesn't smoke.

	She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
	the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
	to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
	wastebasket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it a girl?

				BEN
		Is what a girl?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Whatever it is you're upset
		about.

				BEN
		Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
		disturbed about things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In general.

				BEN
		That's right.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to ask you
		something.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you take me home?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband took the car.  Will
		you drive me home?

	Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
	a set of car keys.

				BEN
		Here - you take it.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

				BEN
		Do you know how to work a
		foreign shift?

	Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

				BEN
		You don't?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.
			(there is a pause)

				BEN
		Let's go.

	She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

								CUT TO:

33	EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING THROUGH THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Mr. Braddock is
	talking to the Terhunes at the door.  Ben and Mrs.
	Robinson come down the hall.

				BEN
		Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride
		home.  I'll be right back.

	Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
	is walking ahead through the front door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(as she passes the
			CAMERA)
		Wonderful party.

								CUT TO:

34	OMITTED

35	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit
	for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	She doesn't move.  Ben gets out and goes around to her side
	and opens the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you come in, please?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want you to come in till I get
		the lights on.

				BEN
		What for?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't feel safe until
		I get the lights on.

	They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
	the door.

36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you mind walking ahead of
		me to the sun porch.  I feel
		funny about coming into a dark
		house.

				BEN
		But it's light in there now.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please.

	Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?  Bourbon?

				BEN
		Look - I drove you home.  I was
		glad to do it.  But I have some
		things on my mind.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		All right then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?

	He looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
		way, but I don't want to be
		alone in this house.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please wait till my husband
		gets home.

				BEN
		When is he coming back?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't know.

	She pours herself a drink.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drink?

				BEN
		No.

	She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

				BEN
		Are you always this much afraid
		of being alone?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, why can't you just lock
		the doors and go to bed?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'm very nuerotic.

	She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I ask you a question?

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you think of me?

				BEN
		What do you mean?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You've known me nearly all of
		your life.  You must have
		formed some opinion.

				BEN
		Well - I've always thought
		that you were a very - nice -
		person.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know I was an alcoholic?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know that?

				BEN
		Look - I think I should be
		going -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
		mind my saying so - this
		conversation is getting a
		little strange.  Now I'm sure
		that Mr. Robinson will be here
		any minute and -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband will be back quite
		late.

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He should be gone for several
		hours.

	She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
	retreats around the other side of the chair.

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Pardon?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What's wrong?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
		I mean you didn't expect -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean - you didn't really
		think that I would do something
		like that.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Like what?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I don't know.

				BEN
		For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
		here we are, you've got me into
		your house.  You give me a
		drink.  You put on music, now
		you start opening up your
		personal life to me and tell
		me your husband won't be home
		for hours.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		So?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
		to seduce me.

	There is a pause.  She looks at him.

				BEN
			(weaker)
		Aren't you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
		I feel rather flattered that
		you -

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
		me for what I just said?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's all right.

				BEN
		It's not all right, it's the
		worst thing I've ever said
		to anyone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down.

				BEN
		Please forgive me.  Because I
		like you.  I don't think of you
		that way.  But I'm mixed up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now finish your drink.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
		that I said that to you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'll forget it right now.
		Finish your drink.

				BEN
		What is wrong with me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you ever seen Elaine's
		portrait?

				BEN
		Her portrait?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We had it done last Christmas.
		Would you like to see it?

				BEN
		Very much.

	We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
	into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
	the doorway to Elaine's room.

37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

				BEN
		Elaine certainly is an
		attractive girl, isn't she?

	In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

				BEN
			(looking at the
			portrait)
		I don't remember her as having
		brown eyes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you unzip my dress?

	He steps back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I think I'll go to bed.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, goodnight.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Won't you unzip my dress?

				BEN
		I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you still think I'm trying
		to seduce you -

				BEN
		No, I don't.  But I just feel
		a little funny.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - you've known me all
		your life.

				BEN
		I know that.  But I'm -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Come on.

	She turns her back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's hard for me to reach.

	Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	Ben walks toward the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What are you so scared of?

				BEN
		I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then why do you keep running
		away?

				BEN
		Because you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Haven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?

				BEN
		Yes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

				BEN
		But I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What if he did?

				BEN
		Well, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you think he trusts us
		together?

				BEN
		Of course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't see why.  I'm twice as
		old as you are.  How could
		anyone think -

				BEN
		But they would!  Don't you see?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm not trying to
		seduce you.  I wish you'd -

				BEN
		I know that.  But please, Mrs.
		Robinson.  This is difficult
		for me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why is it?

				BEN
		Because I am confused about
		things.  I can't tell what
		I'm imagining.  I can't tell
		what's real.  I can't -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you like me to seduce you?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is that what you're trying to
		tell me?

				BEN
		I'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home
		right now.

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		BENJAMIN?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring up my purse before
		you go?

				BEN
		I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

	Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
	She is holding her dress in front of her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I really don't want to put this
		on again.  Won't you bring it
		up?

				BEN
		Where is it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On that chair in the hall.

	She walks out of the shot.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BEN
		Well here's the purse.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Could you bring it up?

				BEN
		Well I'll hand it to you.

	Ben starts back up the stairs.

				BEN
		Come to the railing and I'll
		hand it up.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin - I am getting pretty
		tired of all this suspicion.
		Now if you won't do me a simple
		favor I don't know what.

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

				BEN
		I'm putting it on the top step.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		For God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
	down the hall.

				BEN
		I'm putting it here by the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring it in to me?

				BEN
		I'd rather not.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		All right.  Put it in the room
		where we were.

				BEN
		Right.

38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.

				BEN
		Oh God.

	She smiles.

				BEN
		Let me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't be nervous.

				BEN
		Get away from that door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want to say something first.

				BEN
		Jesus Christ!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I want you to know
		I'm available to you.  If you
		won't sleep with me this time -

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you won't sleep with me this
		time, Benjamin, I want you to
		know you can call me up any
		time you want and we'll make
		some kind of arrangement.

				BEN
		Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand what I said?

				BEN
		Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I find you very attractive
		and any time -

	There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
	Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
	struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
	the hall and down the stairs.

39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

	Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
	FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
	the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
	SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Is that Ben's car in front?

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		Yes, sir!

	FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

				BEN
		I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
		home.  She wanted me to drive
		her home so I - I drove her home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Swell.  I appreciate it.

				BEN
		She's upstairs.  She wanted me
		to wait down here till you got
		home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Standing guard over the old
		castle, are you?

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

	Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Here.  It looks like you need
		a refill.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I've got to go.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is anything wrong?  You look
		a little shaken up.

				BEN
		No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
		a little worried about my
		future.  I'm a little upset
		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.

				BEN
		Thank you very much, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - how old are you now?

				BEN
		Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
		next week.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(taking out a
			cigarette)
		That's a hell of a good age
		to be.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I wish I was that age again.
		Because, Ben -

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. ROBINSON
		You'll never be young again.

				BEN
		I know.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, can I say something to
		you?

				BEN
		What?

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have we known each
		other now?

	Ben shakes his head.

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have you and I known
		each other?  How long have
		your Dad and I been partners?

				BEN
		Quite a while.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I've watched you grow up, Ben.

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		In many ways I feel as though
		you were my own son.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		So I hope you won't mind my
		giving you a friendly piece
		of advice.

				BEN
		I'd like to hear it.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I think - I think you
		ought to be taking it a little
		easier right now than you seem
		to.

	Ben nods.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
		as they come.  Have a good time
		with the girls and so forth.

	Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
	dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't get up.

	Ben sits.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I was just telling Ben here he
		ought to sow a few wild oats.
		Have a good time while he can.
		You think that's sound advice?

	Mrs. Robinson nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I do.

				BEN
		I've got to go.

	He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You have yourself a few flings
		this summer.  I bet you're
		quite a ladies' man.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?  You look like the kind
		of guy that has to fight them
		off.
			(to Mrs. Robinson)
		Doesn't he look to you like
		the kind of guy who has to
		fight them off?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, he does.

	They start out of the sunroom.

40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

				MR. ROBINSON
		Oh say - Elaine gets down from
		Berkeley on Saturday.

				BEN
		Oh yes.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I want you to give her a
		call.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Great.

	Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

41	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
	the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
	behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you for taking me home.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll see you soon, I hope.

	Ben continues to walk toward us.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen - your
		attention, please - for this after-
		noon's feature attraction.

								CUT TO:

42	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Hey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Are you ready in there, feature
		attraction?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Could I speak to you for a second,
		Dad?

	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
	and is readdressing his audience.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- what was I saying?

				MRS. ARNOLD
		Feature attraction.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
		you're paying attention.  A
		feature attraction that will be
		one of the most astounding
		events ever to take place in
		this particular backyard.

	They all laugh and some applaud.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Now I'm going to ask for a big
		round of applause to bring this
		boy out here - wait a minute -
		let me amend that - to bring
		this young man out here - because
		today he is twenty-one-years-
		old -

				MR. ARNOLD
			(his hands like
			a megaphone)
		Let's get on with the show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Just hang on a minute because
		I have a few words to say -

				MR. ARNOLD
		You always do.

	They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
	he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
	comeback.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - could we just talk about
		this for a second?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
		and gentlemen; four of those
		years spent accomplishing some
		rather extraordinary things at
		one of our nation's leading
		seats of learning -

				MR. ARNOLD
		Bring him out!

				PETER AND LOUISE
		On with the show!  On with the
		show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to the window)
		I can't hold them much longer,
		Ben.  You better get out here.

				BEN'S VOICE
		I'd like to discuss this.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to his audience)
		This boy - I'm sorry - this
		young man - is soon to continue
		his education as a Frank Halping-
		ham Award Scholar - but before
		he does -

	Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- before he does -
			(to the window)
		You're disappointing them, Ben.
		You're disappointing them.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - can you listen -

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(meaning it)
		I'll give you ten seconds.
			(back to the
			people)
		He is going to give us a
		practical demonstration of
		what I feel safe in saying is
		a pretty exciting birthday
		present - and it better work
		or I'm out over two hundred
		bucks - so let's hear it for -

	Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
	It slams against the wall inside.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- Benjamin Braddock!

44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY

	At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
	dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
	on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
	mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
	He holds a spear gun in his hand.

	The people applaud.

45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV

	The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
	outside the screen door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Folks - this remarkable young
		man is going to perform for you
		some spectacular and amazing
		feats of daring in water that is
		over six feet deep -

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)

	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
	the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
	down into it.

	PULL UP AND UP AND UP

	Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
	swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
	sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

								DISSOLVE TO:

47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
	the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
		know how to put this -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Look - I was thinking about that
		time after the party -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		- and I was wondering if I could
		buy you a drink or something -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		Uh - The Taft Hotel.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Did you get a room?

				BEN
		No.  Now I know it's pretty
		late and if you'd rather -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Give me an hour.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'll be there in an hour.

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.

				ROOM CLERK
		Can I help you, sir!

				BEN
		What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.

				ROOM CLERK
		Are you here for an affair,
		sir?

	Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
	helplessly at the clerk.

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		The Singleman party, sir?

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

				ROOM CLERK
		It's in the main ballroom.

				BEN
		Ahh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As Ben steps inside.

				VOICE
		Hello.

	Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
	they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
	LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
	are smiling with great determination.

				BEN
		Hello.

	It is the older lady who has said hello.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		You must be one of the Porters.

	She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm not -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'd like you to know my sister,
		Miss DeWitte -

	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
	been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

				MISS DeWITTE
		How do you do?

				BEN
		How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

	Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
	hand.

				BEN
			(apologetically)
		Oh - sorry -

				JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
		Fine, thank you.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		That's Jeffrey, of course.

	Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

				BEN
		Of course.

				MR. SINGLEMAN
		I didn't get your name, sir.

				BEN
		Benjamin Braddock, sir.

	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
	holding.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Braddock - Braddock?

				BEN
		Yes, but I'm afraid -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'll find your table in a moment.
		Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
		a Braniff.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm just looking
		for a friend.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'm afraid I don't understand.

				BEN
			(backing off)
		I'm not with your party - I'm
		sorry.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Hey - I don't get it.

	Ben is backing out.

				MISS DeWITTE
		I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
		Braniff.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Angela - please!

	Ben backs out of the ballroom.

49	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
	the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

50	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
	windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
	dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
	people seated around.

	The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
	and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
	by the window.

	PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

	In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
	She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
	toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
	not see her approach.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

	He rises quickly.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I sit down?

				BEN
		Of course.

	He pulls out a chair, for her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	They sit down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you?

				BEN
		Very well.  Thank you.

	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
	at the center of the table.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I have a drink?

				BEN
		A drink?  Of course.

	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
	The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
	Robinson apologetically.

				BEN
		He didn't see me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Waiter!

	For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
	waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
	moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
	The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I will have a martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Yes, madam.

	The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to be so nervous,
		you know.

				BEN
		Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
		nervous.  I mean it's - it's
		pretty hard to be suave when
		you're -

	He shakes his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you get us a room?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you gotten us a room yet?

				BEN
		I haven't.  No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to?

				BEN
		Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
		Or we could just talk.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want me to get it?

				BEN
		You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to get it now?

				BEN
		Now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I don't know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you get it.

				BEN
		Why don't I get it?  Well -
		I will then.
			(he stands up)
		If you'll excuse me.

	Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

55	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

				ROOM CLERK
		Yes sir?

				BEN
		A room.  I'd like a room,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		A single room or a double
		room?

				BEN
		A single.  Just for myself,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		Will you sign the register,
		please?

	He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
	name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
	crumples it up and fills out a second card.

				ROOM CLERK
		Is anything wrong, sir?

				BEN
		What?  No.  Nothing.

				ROOM CLERK
			(taking a key from
			behind the counter)
		Do you have any luggage, Mister --
			(looks at registration
			card)
		Gladstone?

				BEN
		Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is it?

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is your luggage?

				BEN
		Well it's in the car.  It's
		out in the car.

				ROOM CLERK
		Very good, sir.  I'll have a
		porter bring it in.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				ROOM CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		I mean I'd - I'd rather not
		go to the trouble of bringing
		it all in.  I just have a
		toothbrush.  I can get it my-
		self.  If that's all right.

				ROOM CLERK
		Of course.

	Ben reaches for the key.

				ROOM CLERK
		I'll have a porter show you the
		room.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
		soon find it myself.  I just have
		the toothbrush to carry up and
		I think I can manage it myself.

				ROOM CLERK
		Whatever you say, sir.

	He hands Ben the key.

				BEN
		Thank you.

56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
	absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
	her martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Mrs. Robinson.

	She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
	with a telephone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

	The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
	the table and hands her the receiver.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	The waiter nods and leaves.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(into phone)
		Hello.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		It's Benjamin.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Benjamin Braddock.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin -- where are you?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you look through the glass.

	Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
	glass into the lobby.

57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES

	Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
	feet away.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you see me now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I can.

58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH

	Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
	glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
	the Veranda Room.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

				BEN
		I got a single room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's fine.

				BEN
		But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
		seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
		I mean - I don't know what their policy
		is - but -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well - do you want to go up first?

				BEN
		Yes - I think that would be good.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll be up in five minutes.

				BEN
		Well - goodbye then -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Isn't there something you want to
		tell me?

				BEN
		To tell you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I want you to know how much
		I appreciate this - really -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The number.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The room number, Benjamin.  I think
		you ought to tell me that.

				BEN
		Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
		It's 512.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
		later, Mrs. Robinson.

	He hangs up.

59	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN

	He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

60	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
	to pat his breast pocket.

				BEN
		I've got it.

	The desk clerk looks up.

				BEN
		I say I've got it.

				CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

				CLERK
		Very good, sir.

				BEN
		Yes.  Well - goodnight.

				CLERK
		Goodnight, sir.

	Ben walks out of shot.

60A	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
	opens door.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
	it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
	is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
	on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
	from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
	off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
	the light.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
	through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
	opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
	purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
	mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
	finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

	He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

				BEN
		Well.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
		right?

				BEN
		Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
		stand here?  I mean - I don't know
		what you want me to do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you watch?

				BEN
		Oh - sure.  Thank you.

	She takes off her jacket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you bring me a hanger?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		A hanger.

	Ben opens the closet door.

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  Wood?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Wood or wire?  They have both.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Either one will be fine.

				BEN
		Okay.

	He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you help me with this,
		please?

	She turns her back.

				BEN
		Certainly.

	He undoes the zipper at her neck.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.

	She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would this be easier for you
		in the dark?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
		this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You what?

				BEN
		This is all terribly wrong.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
		I think you're the most attractive
		of all my parents' friends.
		I just don't think we could
		possibly --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you afraid of me?

				BEN
		No - but look - maybe we could
		do something else together,
		Mrs. Robinson - would you like
		to go to a movie.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, is this your first time?

				BEN
		Is this - what?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It is, isn't it?  It is your
		first time.

				BEN
		That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
		That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You can admit that, can't you?

				BEN
		Are you kidding?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's nothing to be ashamed of -

				BEN
		Wait a minute!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On your first time -

				BEN
		Who said it was my first time.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That you're afraid -

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		 - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
		just because you happen to be
		inadequate in one way - 

				BEN
		INADEQUATE!

	LONG pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(starting to dress)

				BEN
		Don't move.

	He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
	disappears.

62	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool

	Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
	ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

67	SHOT - BEN

	He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
	climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
	chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
	goes through.

68	INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM

	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
	is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

	PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
	who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
	let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

	He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
	to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in

	stand facing the bed.

	SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

	PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
	from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
	half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television
	set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set.

	SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

	Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

	SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

	Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

	SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped

				BEN

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Why?

				BEN
		Well - it's very comfortable -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Have you thought about graduate
		school?

				BEN
		No.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Would you  mind telling me then -
		what were those four years of
		college for?  What was the point
		of all that hard work?

				BEN
		You got me.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(trying unsuccessfully
			to control himself)
		Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
		a very good thing that a young
		man - after he's done some very
		good work - should have a chance
		to relax and enjoy himself, and
		lie around, and drink beer and
		so on.  But after a few weeks
		I believe that person would
		want to take some stock in him-
		self and his situation and start
		to think about getting off his
		ass.

	Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Robinson's are here.

	Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
	the sun.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
		yourself these days?

				BEN
		Oh - not too much.  Taking it
		easy.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's what I'd do if I could.
		Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
		Ben, Elaine's coming down from
		Berkeley soon.  I want you to
		call her up this time.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Because I just think you two
		would hit it off real well
		together.

	Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them.  (A long pause)

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Say hello to Mrs. Robinson,
		Benjamin.

84	SHOT - BEN

				BEN
		Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

							DISSOLVE TO:

85	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben, halfway dressed to go out, in slacks, shirt and tie,
	sits in a chair.  The door opens and Mrs. Braddock enters.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Can I talk to you a minute?

				BEN
		Sure.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
		something but you don't have to
		tell me if you don't want.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well I'm going to ask you what
		you do when you go off at night.

				BEN
		When I go off?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		You don't have to tell me if
		you don't want.

				BEN
		No, I do.  I want to tell you.

	There is a pause.

				BEN
		I drive around.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What else?

				BEN
		Nothing else.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well you don't drive around from
		midnight until noon the next
		day, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh, no.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Then what do you do?  Do you
		meet someone?

				BEN
		Meet someone?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well this is your business,
		Benjamin.
			(she starts toward
			the door)
		If you -

				BEN
		No wait.  Wait.

	She stops.

				BEN
		I don't meet anyone, mother, but
		why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
		into your affairs, but I'd
		rather you didn't say anything
		at all than be dishonest.
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, wait.

	She looks at him.

				BEN
		You think I'm being dishonest?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well why do you - why do you
		think that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Because I know you don't drive
		around for twelve hours.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
		tell you what I do?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Not if you don't want to.

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But I don't want you to make
		up something.

				BEN
		I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
		proud of what I do.  I usually
		get kind of drunk.  I usually
		drive over to Los Angeles and
		go to some bars and get kind of
		drunk.  Then I take a hotel
		room.  So I won't have to drive
		home on the freeway.  I mean it
		kind of scares me to drive home
		after - 

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		You believe me, don't you?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		No.

				BEN
		You don't?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		But I want you to.  Please. Please
		will you believe me.

85A	SHOT - MRS. BRADDOCK

				MRS. BRADDOCK
			(she exits)
		Goodnight.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Wait a minute.

								CUT TO:

86-
90	OMITTED

91	INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - SHOT - BEN

	Mrs. Robinson's hands are undoing his necktie.  Ben is
	dressed as in previous scene, plus a jacket.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.
			(he pushes her
			hand away)
		Sit down a minute.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

				BEN
		Will you please sit down a
		minute.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
	down to take off a shoe.

				BEN
		Will you leave that shoe on for
		a minute.  Please.

	She straightens up.

				BEN
		Now - do you think we could say
		a few words to each other first
		this time?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you want.

				BEN
		Good.  I mean are we dead or
		something?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I just don't think we have
		much to say to each other.

				BEN
		All we ever do is come up here
		and throw off the clothes and
		leap into bed together.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you tired of it?

				BEN
		I'm not.  No.  But do you think
		we could liven it up with a
		few words now and then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well what do you want to talk
		about?

				BEN
		Anything.  Anything at all.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to tell me about
		some of your college experiences?

				BEN
		Oh my God.

			MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best
		we can do let's just get the god-
		damn clothes off and --

	She reaches for her shoe.

				BEN
		Leave it on!  Now we are going to
		do this thing.  We are going to
		have a conversation.  Think of
		another topic.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How about art.

				BEN
		Art.  That's a good subject.
		You start it off.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You start it off.  I don't know
		anything about it.

				BEN
		Oh.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you?

				BEN
		Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
		about it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go ahead then.

				BEN
		Art.  Well what do you want to
		know about it.

	She shrugs.

				BEN
		Are you interested more in modern
		art or more in classical art.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Neither.

				BEN
		You're not interested in art?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Then why do you want to talk
		about it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

	Ben nods and looks at the rug.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I take off my clothes now?

				BEN
		No.  Think of another topic.
		Tell me what you did today.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you really want me to?

				BEN
		Yes I do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.

	Ben starts shaking his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to hear it or not?

				BEN
		Yes.  But you might try and spice
		it up with a little originality.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.  I ate breakfast and
		went shopping.  During the after-
		noon I read a novel.

				BEN
		What one.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		What novel did you read.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't remember.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then I fixed supper for my husband
		and waited until -

				BEN
		There!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
		There's something we could have
		a conversation about.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Him?

				BEN
		I mean everything.  I don't know
		anything about how you - how you
		work this.  I don't know how you
		get out of the house at night.  I
		don't know the risk involved.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There isn't any.

				BEN
		There's no risk?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		How do you get out of the house?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I walk out.

				BEN
		You walk right out the door.

	She nods.

				BEN
		What do you say to him?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He's asleep.

				BEN
		Always?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, this isn't a very
		interesting topic.

				BEN
		Please.  Now tell me.  How do
		you know he won't wake up
		sometime and follow you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because he takes sleeping pills.
		He takes three sleeping pills
		every night at ten o'clock.

				BEN
		But what about the noise from
		the car.  What if -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The driveway's on my side of
		the house.

				BEN
			(smiling)
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Calm down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Now let's keep going here.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I undress and talk at the
		same time?

				BEN
		Right.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Now.  You say the driveway's on
		your side of the house.  So I
		guess you don't sleep in the
		same room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We don't.

				BEN
		So you don't - I mean I don't
		like to seem like I'm prying
		but I guess you don't sleep
		together or anything.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No we don't.

				BEN
		Well how long has this been going
		on.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at the
			ceiling for a moment)
		About five years.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		You have not slept with your
		husband for five years?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Now and then.  He geats drunk a
		few times a year.

				BEN
		How many times a year.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
		his birthday.

				BEN
		Man, is this interesting.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		So you don't love him.  You
		wouldn't say you -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We've talked enough, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
		say you loved him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not exactly.

				BEN
		But you don't hate him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
		Unhook my blouse.

				BEN
			(unhooking her blouse)
		Well how do you feel about him,
		then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

				BEN
		Well that's kind of a bad
		situation then, isn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		I mean it doesn't sound like it
		could be much worse.  If you
		hated him at least you'd hate
		him.

	She nods and takes off her blouse.

				BEN
		Well you loved him once, I
		assume.  When you first knew
		him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I never did, Benjamin.  Now
		let's -

				BEN
		Well, wait a minute.  You married
		him.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you do that?

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(taking off her
			stockings)
		See if you can guess.

				BEN
		Well I can't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Think real hard, Benjamin.

				BEN
		I can't see why you did, unless
		...you didn't have to marry him
		or anything, did you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't tell Elaine.

				BEN
		Oh no.  You had to marry him
		because you got pregnant?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you shocked?

				BEN
		Well I never thought of you and
		Mr. Robinson as the kind of
		people who...

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now let's get to bed.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
		So how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean do you feel like telling
		me what were the circumstances?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not particularly.

				BEN
		Was he a law student at the time?

	She nods.

				BEN
		And you were a student also.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		At college.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		What was your major?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why are you asking me all this?

				BEN
		Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
		Now what was your major subject
		at college?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Art.

				BEN
		Art?

	She nods.

				BEN
		But I thought you - I guess you
		kind of lost interest in it over
		the years then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Kind of.

				BEN
		Well how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How do you think.

				BEN
		I mean did he take you up to
		his room with him?  Did you go
		to a hotel?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, what does it possibly
		matter?

				BEN
		I'm curious.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'd go to his car.

				BEN
		Oh no.  In the car you did it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't think we were the first.

	Ben thinks for a moment.

				BEN
		What kind of car was it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Do you remember the make of the
		car?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh my God.

				BEN
		Really.  I want to know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It was a Ford, Benjamin.

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
		Ford!  That's great!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's enough.

				BEN
		So old Elaine Robinson got started
		in a Ford.

	There is a pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't talk about Elaine.

				BEN
		Don't talk about Elaine?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't want you to.

	She walks to the bed.

				BEN
		Well why don't you?

	She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
	jacket.

				BEN
		I wish you'd tell me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There's nothing to tell.

				BEN
		Well why is she a big taboo
		subject all of a sudden?

	Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

				BEN
		Well - I guess I'll have to ask
		her out on a date and find out
		what's --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, don't you ever take
		that girl out.

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand that?

				BEN
		Well look.  I have no intention
		of taking her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		I was just kidding around.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		But why shouldn't I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I have my reasons.

				BEN
		Then let's hear them.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
		Robinson.  Because I think I
		know what they are.

	She pulls the covers down.

				BEN
		I'm not good enough for her to
		associate with, am I?  I'm not
		good enough to even talk about
		her, am I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Let's drop it.

				BEN
		We're not dropping it.  Now
		that's the reason, isn't it?
		I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
		I?  I'm not fit to -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		I'm good enough for you but I'm
		too slimy to associate with
		your daughter.  That's it, isn't
		it?  ISN'T IT?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		You go to hell.  You go straight
		to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
		think I'm proud of myself?  Do
		you think I'm proud of this?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I wouldn't know.

				BEN
		Well, I'm not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You're not.

				BEN
		No sir.  I am not proud that I
		spend my time with a broken-
		down alcoholic!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I see.

				BEN
		And if you think I come here
		for any reason besides pure
		boredom, then you're all wrong.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Because - Mrs. Robinson this
		is the sickest, most perverted
		thing that ever happened to
		me.  And you do what you want
		but I'm getting the hell out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you?

				BEN
		You're goddamn right I am.

	He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
	the bed and watches him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's how you feel about me.

	He nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That I'm a sick and disgusting
		person.

				BEN
		Now don't start this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Don't start acting hurt.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you expect me to be a
		little hurt?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
		and tell me I'm not good enough
		for your daughter.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did I say that?

				BEN
		Of course you did.

	She shakes her head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to apologize
		to you if that's the impression
		you got.

				BEN
		Well two minutes ago you told
		me I wasn't good enough for
		your daughter.  Now you say
		you're sorry I got that
		impression.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I didn't mean it.  I don't think
		you'd be right for each other.
		But I would never say you
		weren't as good a person as
		she is.

				BEN
		You wouldn't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Of course I wouldn't.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

				BEN
		What are you doing?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well it's pretty obvious you
		don't want me around any more.

				BEN
		Well look - I was kind of upset
		there.  I'm sorry I said those
		things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If that's how you feel -

				BEN
		But it's not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(smiling at him)
		That's all right.  I think I
		can understand why I'm disgusting
		to you.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
		wouldn't keep coming here if
		I didn't like you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But if it's sickening for you -

				BEN
		It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
		forward to it.  It's the one
		thing I have to look forward
		to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to say that.

				BEN
		Well I wouldn't.  I would never
		say it if it wasn't true.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I stay then?

				BEN
		Yes. Please.  I want you to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Well don't thank me, because I
		want you to.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But you won't ever take out
		Elaine, will you?  I want you
		to promise me that.

	There is another long pause.

				BEN
		Look.  Why the hell did you
		bring this up.  It never
		occured to me to take her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then give me your word you won't.

				BEN
		This is absurd.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Promise me, Benjamin.

				BEN
		All right, for christ's sake.
		I promise I will never take
		out Elaine Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.
			(pause)
		Benjamin -

				BEN
		Let's not talk about it.  Let's
		not talk at all.

	At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
	other, they begin to take off their clothes.

								FADE OUT

	FADE IN

92	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
	at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
	are there.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Elaine's back from school.  I
		think it might be a nice gesture
		if you asked her out.

	Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
	eating and reading.

								CUT TO:

93	INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
	doorway.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't you think that she's a
		terribly attractive girl?
		Because I think she's one of
		the prettiest girls I've
		ever seen.

	Ben gives a small whimper.

								CUT TO:

94	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
	Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
	is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
	down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
	in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
	Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
	swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
	their heads above the surface.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		It's pretty embarrassing.  I
		really don't know what to tell
		Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
		and strained for me every time
		he suggests that you call up
		Elaine.

				BEN
		Next time he suggests it,
		I'll tell him I have no
		intention of ever calling
		her up in my life.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess she's not good enough
		for you, is that it?

				BEN
		Look - Elaine Robinson and I
		do not get along.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		How do you know?  You haven't
		seen her since high school.  I
		guess your evenings, whatever
		you do with them, are just too
		valuable.

				BEN
		That has nothing to do with it -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
		that you're just too busy every
		evening - doing God knows what -

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't go on like this.  Now if
		Benjamin absolutely refuses to
		take her out -

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		- then I'll simply invite all the
		Robinsons' over for dinner on
		Thursday.

95	SHOT - BEN

	He slides off the raft and goes underwater.

96	SHOT - BEN UNDERWATER

	His hair streaming up, his eyes open.

							CUT TO:

97	INT. SPECIAL SET BRADDOCK DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
	table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
	the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
	back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
	facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
	the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
	eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
	Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
	continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
	Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

							CUT TO:

98	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the
	pool.

				BEN
		I'll go call Elaine now.

	Mr. and Mrs. Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and
	try to smile at each other.

	SOUND:  Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.

							CUT TO:

99	EXT. & INT. ROBINSON FRONT DOOR, HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

	The door opens.  Mr. Robinson stands there with a huge
	smile.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Braddock - it's about
		time you got around to this.
		Come on in.  I'm afraid the
		young lady isn't quite ready
		yet -

	Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
	sitting there.

				BEN
		Hello.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What would you say to a short one?
		Bourbon still your drink?

				BEN
		Yes.

	Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I'll see if she's ready.

	Mr. Robinson exits.

		about it, Benjamin.

	Mr. Robinson and ELAINE enter.

				ELAINE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Hello.

101	CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Well - I want you to keep your
		wits about you tonight.  You never
		know what tricks Ben picked up
		back there in the East.

							LAP DISSOLVE TO:

102	EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
	leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
	and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

				ELAINE
		You're living at home now.  Is
		that right?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		Do you know what you're going
		to do?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Are you going to graduate school?

				BEN
		No.

	He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
	does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
	right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
	down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
	driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
	Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

				ELAINE
		Do you always drive like this?

				BEN
		Yes.

103	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS.
	Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.

				BEN
		Do you want some dinner?

				ELAINE
		I'd love some.

	A waiter moves forward toward them.

				BEN
		Bring a menu.

				WAITER #2
		Dinner for two, sir?

				BEN
		No.  Just for her.

	The waiter moves away.

				ELAINE
		Aren't you eating?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Why not?

				BEN
		If it's all right with you,
		I'm not hungry.

	The waiter returns with a menu.

				ELAINE
		I've changed my mind.  Thank
		you.

104	EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS

	Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

105	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
	entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
	who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
	he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
	Elaine is just behind him.

								CUT TO:

106	INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
	them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
	on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
	dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
	its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
	the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
	unsure.

				BEN
		Sit down.

	Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
	Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
	puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
	each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
	looking directly at Elaine.

				BEN
		Why don't you watch the show?

	The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - do you dislike me
		for some reason?

				BEN
		No - why should I?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

107	SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER

	She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
	twirling the tassels.

				BEN
		You're missing a great effect
		here.

	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
	back.

				BEN
		How do you like that?

	Elaine doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Could you do it?

				ELAINE
		No.

	The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
	Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
	walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

	The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
	spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
	face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
	her eyes.

	The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
	and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
	DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
	and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
	front of Elaine's face.

108	SHOT - BEN

	He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
	swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

	The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
	swing more frantically.

109	SHOT - ELAINE

	She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

110	SHOT - BEN

	With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

111	SHOT - ELAINE

	Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
	fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
	of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

112	SHOT - BEN

	He reaches up to remove the glasses.

113	SHOT - ELAINE

	As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
	spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
	her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
	at Ben.

114	SHOT - BEN

	With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
	and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

				STRIPPER
		Hey!

	Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
	Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

								CUT TO:

115	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
	bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
	is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
	her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
	catches her and holds her arm.

				BEN
		Elaine - I'm sorry.

	Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
	her arm away.

				ELAINE
		Will you take me home now?

				BEN
		I'm sorry I took you in there.

				ELAINE
		I think I'd better go home now
		please.

				BEN
		But, Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Where is the car?

				BEN
		I just want to tell you something.

	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
	to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

				ELAINE
		I want to go home.

				BEN
		But could I just tell you this
		one thing?

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		This whole idea - this date
		and everything.  It was my
		parents' idea.  They forced me
		into it.

				ELAINE
		Oh - that's very nice of
		you to tell me.

				BEN
		No.  What I mean is - that's
		why I've been acting this way.
		I'm not like this.  I hate
		myself like this.

	She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
	them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
	them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

				BEN
		Listen - could you stop crying,
		please?

				ELAINE
		No, I couldn't.

				BEN
		But could you try?

				ELAINE
		No.

	She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
	for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
	takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
	her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
	little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
	her eyes.

	He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
	of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
	her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
	on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
	to one side.

				BEN
		Elaine -

	He starts to pull her head back.

				ELAINE
		Not here.  Not here.

							DISSOLVE TO:

116	EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
	restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
	side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
	furiously.

				BEN
		I've had this feeling - ever
		since I've graduated - this -
		kind of compulsion that I have
		to be rude all the time.  Do
		you know what I mean?

				ELAINE
		Yes, I do.

	He looks at her.

				BEN
		It's like I've been playing
		some kind of - game - but the
		rules don't make any sense to
		me -

	She is watching him carefully.

				BEN
		- they're being made up by all
		the wrong people - no - I mean
		no one makes them up, they seem
		to have made themselves up.

	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
	slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
	and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
	across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
	kid behind the wheel.

				BEN
		Say - I wonder if I could request
		you to turn that down a little?

	The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
	windows up.

117	SERIES OF SHOTS

	From outside of car.  Ben is talking with great animation
	- Elaine is watching him.  They are both eating as Ben
	talks, telling Elaine a story.  Their windows are rolled
	up.

	SOUNDS: Cars GUNNING their ENGINES; horns HONKING;
	radios PLAYING; waitresses YELLING orders; customers
	YELLING at waitresses; kids LAUGHING and TALKING from
	car to car; MOTORCYCLES driving in and out, TRAFFIC.

118	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson
	house.  The RADIO plays QUIETLY.  Ben turns it OFF.  They
	sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's
	hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

				ELAINE
		Well - maybe I'd better go in.

	He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
	moment.

				ELAINE
		Would you like to come in?  I
		could make some coffee.

				BEN
		No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
		wake anyone up.

				ELAINE
		We won't.  Let's go inside.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				ELAINE
		Is anything wrong?

				BEN
		No - I was just thinking -
		look - it's still early -
		we could do something - go
		somewhere else.

				ELAINE
		All right.

	He starts the car immediately and drives away from the
	house.

	Ben is driving.

				BEN
		I'm trying to think of where

				ELAINE
		Isn't there one in the Taft

	There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off
	the road.

				ELAINE
		What is the matter?

				BEN
		Nothing.  I'm just wondering if

120	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside

		Listen, Elaine - it seems to me

				ELAINE
		Of course there is.  Look -

	ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out.

		Hello, how are you, sir?

	The room clerk smiles at them.

		Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

	Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the

	revealing many people moving back and forth in the

				MISS DeWITTE
		Hello, Mr. Brannif.

	SOUND:  Car STARTING noisily.

122	EXT. TAFT HOTEL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off
	the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car
	speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
	turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
	head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

				BEN
		Elaine - I like you.  I like you
		so much.  Do you believe that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Do you?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		You're the first - you're the

		I could stand to be with.

	She takes his hand.

				BEN
		I mean my whole life is such a

		sorry.  I'll take you home now.

	He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - are having an

	He freezes with his hand still on the key.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.

	He turns off the engine.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.  That is not my

				BEN
		It just happened.  It was just

	She nods.

				ELAINE
		Was she married or something?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE

	It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
	From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
	Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
	playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
	Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
	of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
	dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
	reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
	and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drive down the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I have a date

		Do exactly what I say.

	Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.

125	ANOTHER ANGLE - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

	As they drive.

				BEN
		Now it seems to me -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Listen to me very carefully,
		Benjamin.  You are not to see
		Elaine again.  Ever.  Those
		are my orders.  Is that clear?

	Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down
	the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I can makes things quite unpleasant.

				BEN
		How?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In order to keep Elaine away
		from you - I am prepared to
		tell her everything.

				BEN
		I don't believe you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then you'd better start believing me.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it.  I'm
		asking you please not to wreck it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go home now.

				BEN
		I just don't believe you would do that.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Try me.

	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
	he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
	his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

	TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
	way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front

	Ben pushes her back into her room.

	Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

130	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
	in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
	they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
	can be heard coming up the stairs.

				BEN
		Elaine - I have to tell you

	He holds her against the wall in the corner.

				ELAINE
		What is it?

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		That woman.  The older woman.

				ELAINE
		You mean the one who -

		What are you telling me?

	The FOOTSTEPS stop.

131	ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE

	Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
	crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
	Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
	mother's eyes staring.

				ELAINE
		Please - will somebody tell me -

	She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
	Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
	door.  Elaine looks away.

				ELAINE
		Oh - no.

	Ben backs up.

				BEN
		Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Oh my God -

	Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
	as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

				BEN
		Please.

	Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
	then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
	of her eyes.

				BEN
		No - don't cry -

				ELAINE
		GET OUT!

				BEN
		Don't cry.

			out to her)

		No - they don't.

		Well - when did you decide all

				BEN
		No.  She doesn't know about it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		She doesn't know that you're

				BEN
		No.  Actually - she doesn't
		know about us getting married
		yet.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		When did you two talk this over?

				BEN
		We haven't.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben - this whole idea sounds
		pretty half-baked.

				BEN
		No - it's not.  It's completely
		baked.  It's a decision I've made.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But what makes you think she
		wants to marry you?

	Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.

	NO. 1, who sits at a reception desk.

				LADY RECEPTIONIST NO. 1
		May I help you?

				BEN

	The Receptionist runs her pencil along a list of names

				LADY RECEPTIONIST NO. 1
		Three-oh-eight.  Shall I call

	The Receptionist's hand moves to the receiver of a phone on
	the desk.  Ben looks at her hand for several seconds.  He
	takes a step backward.  Her hand starts to lift the receiver.
	Ben moves backward, puts his hand up as though to stop her

				MR. McCLEERY
		You a student?

				BEN
		Not exactly.

	Mr. McCleery stops and turns.  Ben almost runs into him.

				MR. McCLEERY
		What's that?

				BEN
		I said - not exactly - no.

				MR. McCLEERY
		What are you then?

				BEN
		Well - I'm just sort of traveling

				MR. McCLEERY
		I like to know who's living in

				BEN
		Ahhh.

	Mr. McCleery just looks up at him.

				BEN
		I'm not up too much, actually,
		I'm just visiting.  I mean -
		I've always wanted to see

	Mr. McCleery takes a couple more steps and stops again.

				MR. McCLEERY
		You're not one of those agitators?

				BEN
		What?

				MR. McCLEERY
		One of those outside agitators.

		Oh - no sir.

	They are getting quite near.  Suddenly they are joined
	by THREE AFRICAN EXCHANGE STUDENTS, in tribal robes.
	They all greet each other and continue to walk toward us.

166	SHOT - BEN

	He looks at the massed group moving toward him, horror
	taking over his face.  He starts forward.  As he passes
	Elaine and her friends he seems to take a deep breath and
	hold it.

	She stops and slowly turns to look in his direction.  Her
	companions also stop.  Ben changes his direction and
	makes a circle to his left as though he has just changed
	his mind.  He looks at her.  He does not stop walking.
	He makes a slow circle around her as he speaks.

				BEN
		Elaine.  Hey - what a surprise.

		Say - I thought I remembered that

	They watch him as he gets further and further away and

	He leans forward.

	Elaine comes out of a bookstore across the street.  She
	crosses the street and moves to a bus stop.  He stands,

	Ben comes out of the door just as Elaine gets into a bus
	and the doors close behind her.

	The bus starts off.  Ben runs after it.  The bus gets to

		Excuse me - I'm sorry - I

	There is a pause and then, immediately behind her:

		Well - how about this for a

	to the rear exit door.  Elaine continues to look out the

				BEN
			(leaning in a little)
		I was wondering where you were

	Elaine doesn't answer.  The lady sitting next to Elaine
	takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben,
	then looks at Elaine again.

				ELAINE
		I'm meeting someone.

				BEN
		Ah.  Where?

	She doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Where are you meeting this person?

				ELAINE
		At the Zoo.

				BEN
		The Zoo.  They have a pretty good
		one here, do they?

				ELAINE
		I've never been to it.

		Oh.  Well, I haven't either.  I
		might just ride out there with you.

	Hold on them riding.

							CUT TO:

	Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the

	Elaine.  He is darting glances to the right and left.

				BEN
		Is that him over there?

				ELAINE
		No.

				BEN
		Where did he say he was going
		to meet you?

				ELAINE
		I thought he said by the monkey

				BEN
		Oh.

	She stops.  Ben stops.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I would like to know

				BEN
		Here?  In Berkelely?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, I have this very pleasant
		room on Carter Street - and I've
		been getting to some classes -

				ELAINE
		But you're not enrolled.

				BEN
		No.  I just sit in.  They don't
		seem to mind.  They've been
		very congenial about it.

	She looks at him and starts to shake her head.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - you're - I don't

				BEN
		Maybe we could get together

				ELAINE
		- really incredible -

				BEN
		Here he comes.

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		I've got a real feeling that
		this is the fellow.

	Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
	briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

				CARL
			(waving)
		Elaine!

				BEN
		He certainly is a good walker.

	Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
	mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
	takes Elaine's hands.

				CARL
		Am I late?  I'm sorry.

				BEN
		We thought you said by the
		monkey house.

	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
	Ben smiles.

				ELAINE
		This is Benjamin Braddock.
		Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode
		here with me on the bus.

				CARL
		Glad to meet you, Ben.

	Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

				BEN
		Great meeting you, Carl.

	Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
	The three of them look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Swell seeing you.  Have a good
		time.

	Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
	and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
	stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
	cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
	at:

177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE

	Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
	gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

178	SHOT - BEN

	As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
	The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
	his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
	cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
	look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
	with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
	to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

	He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
	He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
	crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
	to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
	takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
	sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
	is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
	bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
	He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
	to straighten it out with the iron.

	There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
	back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
	then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
	on his lap.

				BEN
		Come in.

	There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens
	it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

				ELAINE
		I want to ask you a question.

				BEN
		Come in.

				ELAINE
		No.  I want to know why you're
		here in Berkeley?

				BEN
		Because - I am.

				ELAINE
		Is it because I'm here?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				ELAINE
		I think it is.

	Ben nods.

				ELAINE
		I said I think it is.

				BEN
		All right then!  Yes!

				ELAINE
		Well, I want you to leave.

				BEN
		Elaine - I love you.

				ELAINE
			(looking down)
		How could you do that, Benjamin?

	Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

				ELAINE
		Do you just hate everything?
		How could you possibly rape
		my...

				BEN
		What?

				ELAINE
		I don't understand -

				BEN
		Did you say rape her?

				ELAINE
		- how you - how anyone - could
		do a thing like that.

				BEN
		What did she say?

				ELAINE
			(holding his arm)
		Let me go.

				BEN
		You've got to tell me what she
		said.

	He touches her hair.

				ELAINE
		Why?

				BEN
		Because it isn't true.

				ELAINE
		I don't feel well.

	Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
	along side her.

				BEN
		Tell me.

	Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

				ELAINE
		She said she was having a drink
		in the hotel with a friend.
		You waited for her in the parking
		lot and told her she was too
		drunk to drive home and that
		you would get her a room for
		the night.

				BEN
		Then what?

				ELAINE
		Then you took her upstairs and
		you raped her.

				BEN
		Elaine - that is not what happened.

	She puts her hands on his shoulder.

				ELAINE
		Please let me go.

				BEN
		All right - but listen to me.
		What happened was there was
		this party at my parents.  I
		drove your mother home - then
		we went upstairs to see your
		portrait -

	Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

				ELAINE
		Don't tell me -

				BEN
		- and when we got up in the
		room she starts taking her her
		clothes off - and -

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - this is my mother!

				BEN
		- suddenly there she was without
		any clothes on - I mean really
		naked -

	Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
	long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
	the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
	water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
	door.

	SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
	Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
	from a hanger and puts it on.

	SOUND:  A KNOCK on the door.

		What's going on in there?

	Elaine sits up and drinks the water.  Ben looks at
	her then goes to the door and opens it.

				BEN
		Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Who screamed?

				BEN
		It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Screaming isn't all right.  Not
		in my house it isn't.

				BEN
		It was just a visitor.  But it's
		all right now.

	Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see
	into the room.  Ben edges through the door into the
	hallway.

184	INT. ROOMING HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

				MR. McCLEERY
		What did you do to her?

				BEN
		Look - she's all right.  She's
		upset and she screamed.  But
		she's okay now.

				A BOY
		Shall I get the cops?

				BEN
		What?

				A BOY
		I'll get the cops.

	He starts for the stairs.

				BEN
		Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
		it - look.

	He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

				BEN
		See - she's just having some
		water.  Now there's no need
		for the cops or anything.

				MR. McCLEERY
		All right, boys - I think you
		can get back to your rooms.  I
		don't think we'll have any more
		of this agitation.  Will we,
		Braddock?

				BEN
		No, sir.

	The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
	stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

				MR. McCLEERY
		I want you out of here.

	Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
	down the stairs.

				BEN
		Mr. McCleery?

				MR. McCLEERY
		You heard me.  Out of here.

				BEN
		What for?

				MR. McCLEERY

185	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Elaine is standing at the sink.  She is putting water on

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry I screamed.

	Ben opens the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin, when you came up here,
		what did you think was going to
		happen between us?

				BEN
		Elaine - right now I don't feel
		like talking much.  I'm sorry
		about everything but I think I'll
		just do this now.

	He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Can I just sit here while you're
		packing?

				BEN
		If you want.

	Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
	the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
	in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
	down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

				ELAINE
		What are you looking for?

				BEN
		My belt.

				ELAINE
		Don't you have it on?

				BEN
		No.  I have two.  The other one
		is the one I'm looking for.
			(he reaches under
			the bureau)
		What's this?
			(he brings out a
			marble)
		It's from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		The marble?

				BEN
		The belt I'm looking for was
		from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		Oh.

	Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

				ELAINE
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I don't know.

	He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
	and carries them to the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Are you going home?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Well - where are you going?

	He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
	some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the
	suitcase.

				BEN
		Elaine - you're going to have to
		stop asking me that.

	He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to
	the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some
	ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine
	gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

		I don't understand.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to go anywhere

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Why do you have to see him?

				ELAINE
		Well -- I said I might marry him.

	Elaine and several other girls run onto the court as a
	number of girls run off the court to the bench.

				BEN
			(yelling after her)
		You WHAT?

							CUT TO:

195	INT. LIBRARY - DAY

	Ben is seated across a study table from Elaine.  There are
	many other students scattered around the room.

				BEN
		How did he do it?  Did he get down
		on his knees?  He didn't get down
		on his knees, I hope.

				ELAINE
		No, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

				ELAINE
		He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

				BEN
		Oh no.  He said that.

				ELAINE
		Shhhh.

				BEN
		Where did he do it?

	She starts to get up.

				BEN
		I'd like to know where it happened?

	She starts to move away.

				BEN
		It wasn't in his car, was it?

							CUT TO:

196	EXT. WENDELL HALL - DAY

				BEN
		Are we getting married tomorrow?

				ELAINE
		No.

				BEN
		The day after tomorrow?

				ELAINE
		Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.

	She goes through the doorway into Wendell Hall.  Ben remains
	standing in exactly the same positin.  After a few moments
	the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben,
	kisses him, then runs back inside.  Ben turns and starts
	away from the door.  The door opens again.  Ben turns back
	and takes a step toward the door, smiling expectantly.  A
	tall bearded MAN comes out and goes past Ben.  Ben breaks up.

							CUT TO:

196A	EXT. BERKELEY STRRET - DAY

	Through the window of a hippy jewelry store we see a sales-
	woman modeling a ring for Ben.  He nods, she takes it off,

197	INT. ROOMING HOUSE STAIRS AND BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben is whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a
	time.  He opens the door to his room and steps in.  The room
	is dark.  The figure of a MAN is silhouetted against the
	window.  Ben freezes just inside the door.  There is a long
	pause.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(clearing his throat)
		Do you want - do you want to try
		and tell me why you did it?

				BEN
		Mr. Robinson?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you have a special grudge
		against me?  Do you feel a particularly
		strong resentment for me?

				BEN
		No, it's not --

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is there something I've said that's
		caused this contempt?  Or is it just
		the things I stand for that you
		despise?

				BEN
		It was nothing to do with you, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to
		do with me.

	Ben takes a step forward.

				BEN
		Now look - please -

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, I think we're two civilized
		human beings.  Do you think it's
		necessary to threaten each other?

				BEN
		I am not threatening you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you want to unclench your fists,
		please?  Thank you.  I can see in
		the dark, you know.  I've been here
		quite a while.

				BEN
		I am trying to tell you I have no
		personal feelings about you, Mr.
		Robinson.  I am trying to tell
		you I do not resent you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You don't respect me terribly
		much either, do you?

				BEN
		No, I don't.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, I don't think we have a
		whole lot to say to each other,
		Ben.  I do think you should know
		the consequences of what you've
		done.  I do think you should
		know that my wife and I are
		getting a divorce soon.

				BEN
		But why?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Why?

				BEN
		It shouldn't make any difference
		what happened.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's quite a statement.

				BEN
		Listen to me.  We got - we got
		into bed with each other.  But
		it was nothing.  It was nothing
		at all.  We might - we might just
		as well have been shaking hands.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Shaking hands.  Well, that's not
		saying much for my wife, is it?

				BEN
		You miss the point.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Don't shout at me, Ben.

				BEN
		The point is - I don't love your
		wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well - I'm sure you think you do,
		Ben, but after a few times in
		bed with Elaine I feel quite sure
		you'd get over that as quickly
		as you -

				BEN
		HUH?

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think I've talked about this
		enough.  I don't know how far
		I can go, Ben.  I don't know if
		I can prosecute or not, but I
		think maybe I can.  In the light
		of what's happened I think maybe
		I can get you behind bars if you
		ever look at my daughter again.
		I have seen Elaine and I have
		spent the afternoon taking steps
		to insure...

	Mr. Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door.
	Ben takes a step toward him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Stay away from me, Ben!

	Mr. Robinson stands at the door.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I don't want to mince words with
		you.  As far as Elaine's concerned
		you're to get her out of your
		filthy mind right now.  Is that
		perfectly clear ro you?  That's
		all, Ben.  You'll pardon me if
		I don't shake hands with you.

	Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are filth.

	Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are scum.

	Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs.  Mr. McCleery is
	standing on the stairway, listening.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You are a degenerate!

	Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr.
	McCleery who looks up at Ben.

				BEN
			(takes out some
			money)
		Look - I'll give you ten dollars
		for a dime - I'll give you
		twenty - for God's sake, will
		you let me use that phone?

				MR. McCLEERY
		I am going to call the police now.

				BEN
		Could I make one phone call first?

				MR. McCLEERY
		Get out!

	Ben stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the
	stairs and out of the building.  Through the door we see
	him run down the street and out of sight.

          OPENING TITLE.
          
          "ALTHOUGH THIS MOTION PICTURE IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY,
          CERTAIN CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL."
          
                                                   FADE IN:
          
          SUPER: 'SEPTEMBER 1973'.
          
          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          A phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the
          open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It
          sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty
          bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays.
          EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT
          
          A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the
          night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly,
          its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels
          sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver
          fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and
          he's in a hurry.
          
          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
          
          Two figures are struggling on the floor. The male is
          naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent,
          her breath fast. They appear to be having sex.
          
          EXT. TRIKE. DAWN
          
          The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show
          desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering
          neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
          
          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a
          bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there
          is also a man's shape, which now moves.
          
          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
          
          A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and
          woman are struggling. There is fear on her face.
          
          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly
          off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the
          sleep away and looks for the damn phone.
          
                                                                 2.
          
          
          
          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
          
          The woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest
          with her fists. He is motionless underneath her.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN
          
          The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the
          driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in
          one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped
          'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.
          
          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          The man finally answers the phone.   At last the ringing
          stops.
                               PHIL
                    Hello?
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
          
          The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking
          quickly through the room.
          
          As he searches, we hear:
          
                              WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Oh my God please help me! I
                    found your number in his pocket
                    and I don't know... I don't know
                    what to do.
          
                              PHIL'S VOICE
                    Ah, what... who are you?
                              WOMAN'S VOICE
                    He's dead... he's dead... and
                    I'm... just... I don't know what
                    to do.
          
          The man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers.
          
                               PHIL'S VOICE
                    Hold on.   Tell me who's dead.
          
                              WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met
                    in a bar and we had a lot to
                    drink and he just...
          
                              PHIL'S VOICE
                    Are you sure he's dead?
          
          He looks under the beds.
          
                                                                3.
          CON TINUE D:
          
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Yeah. He's really dead.    He
                         just...
          
                                   PHIL'S VOICE
                         Listen. Call an ambulance.
                         Where are you?
          
                                   WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn.
                         Room eight.
          
          He checks on top of the wardrobe.
          
                                   PHIL'S VOICE
                         Have you got a car?
                                   WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Yes.
          
                                   PHIL'S VOICE
                         Call an ambulance. Then get out
                         of there. Okay? Okay?
          
                                   WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...
          
          He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and
          glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and
          for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.
          
          EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING
          
          The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital.
          There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a
          reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background.
          Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks
          to the entrance.
          
          INT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
          
          We move through the reception area up to the nurses'
          station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a
          nurse's uniform.
          
                                   NURSE
                         You wanna run that by me again,
                         sir?
          
                                  PHIL
                         Okay. I'd like to see Gram
                         Parsons.
          
          They stare at each other.
          
                                                                4.
          CON TINUE D:
          
                                   NURSE
                         You want to see Gram Parsons?
          
                                   PHIL
                         Yes. Alone, if possible. And
                         would you have a gurney standing
                         by in case I need to move him?
          
          She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from
          under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is
          wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked
          cigar.
          
                                   NURSE
                         And you are.... his physician?
                         Or perhaps a close relative?
          Phil clears his throat.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Actually, I'm his road manager.
          
          The big nurse smiles mirthlessly.
          
                                   NURSE
                         So you're not his physician or a
                         close relative?
          
          A beat.
          
                                   PHIL
                         No.
          
                                   NURSE
                         Mister Parsons is awaiting a post
                         mortem. He will then be
                         delivered to his family. I
                         suggest you speak to them if you
                         wish to pick through his personal
                         effects. Sir.
          
          She turns away.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Now listen here...
          
                                   NURSE
                         No, you listen here. Mister
                         Parsons is dead and no longer
                         appears to need a road manager.
                         Which makes two of us.
          
          The nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits
          until she's gone and then walks through a door marked
          'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'.
          
                                                                  5.
          
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM. MORNING
          
          Phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash.
          He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a
          hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING
          
          Phil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and
          checking signs. He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'.
          
          INT. HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB. MORNING
          
          The room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on
          trolleys. Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils
          at whatever it is which lies beneath.
                              PHIL
                    Sheesh!
          
          He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet.   He
          stares down at the body, visibly moved.
          
                              PHIL (CONT'D)
                    Hello buddy. How you been?
          
          He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking
          down at his friend. Then he snaps out of it.
          
                              PHIL (CONT'D)
                    Well, I can't stand around here
                    chatting with you all day.
                    Things to do...
          
          He wheels the gurney towards the door.
          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING
          
          Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit.
          A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a
          clipboard.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Can I help you?
          
                              PHIL
                    Naw, I'm cool thanks.
          
          The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    What are you doing?
          
                               PHIL
                    Just taking some stiff down to
                    neurology.
          
                                                                  6.
          CON TINUE D:
          
                                   DOCTOR
                         We don't have a neurology
                         department.
          
                                    PHIL
                         Urology.
          
          The doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the
          doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes
          his head in frustration.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Okay. Just hold your horses -
                         I'll go check the paperwork.
          
          The doctor holds up his clipboard.
                                   DOCTOR
                         I have the paperwork.
          
                                   PHIL
                         No. You have your paperwork. I
                         need to go check my paperwork.
          
          He slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly     for
          a few seconds, and then pushes open the door.
          
                                    DOCTOR
                         Hello?   Hello...
          
          He glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in
          sight.
          
          EXT. DESERT. MORNING
          Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction.      To
          the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the
          left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it
          skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying
          across the road.
          
          NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through
          the desert, set to music.
          
          EXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAY
          
          The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two
          enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant
          Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six
          foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets
          out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his
          pocket.
          
                                                                 7.
          
          
          
          INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
          
          Phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. He
          slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We
          see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips
          through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is
          SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes.
          
                                 SUSIE
                    Guess who?
          
                              PHIL
                    Martin Luther King.
          
                              SUSIE
                    Try again...
          Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a
          long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes
          kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull
          away with little success.
          
                              PHIL
                    This.... ...isn't.... ...the
                    best time... ...Baby....
          
          Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to
          resist. He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss
          passionately.
          
          INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Phil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table.   He takes
          a drag from her cigarette and passes it back.
                                 SUSIE
                    God damn!     I'm so sorry, baby.
          
                              PHIL
                    Yeah, out of a job again.
          
                              SUSIE
                    Would never have happened if you
                    were there.
          
                              PHIL
                    How do you know I wasn't?
          
                              SUSIE
                    Well, if you were, you wouldn't
                    have let him die.
          
                              PHIL
                    I was still 'on staff'. He was
                    still my responsibility.
          
                                                                      8.

          They sit quietly for a moment.      Then:
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         So where have you been, anyway?
          
          She sighs, and stands up.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         How long this time? Two weeks?
          
                                   SUSIE
                         Yeah, let's have this
                         conversation again. Like you
                         haven't just done six weeks on
                         the road...
                                   PHIL
                         Yeah, but I usually leave a note.
                         And there's a paycheck involved.
          
          Susie disappears through the door. Phil's shoulders sag
          and he slumps against the wall. Then Susie reappears with
          a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses. She
          pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil.
          
                                   SUSIE
                         Come here...
          
          After a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room.
          
          INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
          
          Susie guides Phil to a chair and sits him down.
          
                                   PHIL
                         What's this?
          
                                   SUSIE
                         This is a remembrance.
          
          She crosses to a record player and turns it on, pausing to
          let down the blind on the way back. 'In My Hour of
          Darkness'(or similar music) fills the room.

                         that it had never been sung
                         before. It was 'country rock',
                         if you like. And it was kinda
                         catchy. At least, the young
                         people seemed to lap it up. It's
                         fair to say that when Gram
                         Parsons died, he died a star.

                                   REPORTER
                         And another light burns out in
                         the desert. Gram Parsons - the
                         standard bearer of the new
                         country music movement - is dead,
                         following an overdose of drugs.
                         While many of America's young
                         people are today in mourning,
                         their parents will view this as
                         another example of how today's
                         drug culture can so easily claim
                         a life. We'll leave you tonight
                         with the young man's own words.
                         Gram Parsons wrote a song called
                         'In My Hour of Darkness', which
                         contains these words: 'In my hour
                         of darkness...'
          
          We are back in Phil's sitting room. Fade up on the music,
          to match the reporter's words, as Gram's voice fills the
          room: (or similar music).
          
                                   GRAM'S VOICE

                         time of need, Oh Lord grant me
                         vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.
                         Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord

          Susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping Phil as

          Susie walks in with a coffee. She sits beside Phil and
          strokes his head until he wakes. She kisses him and passes
          him the cup.

          He sits up and stretches. She leans over to kiss him, then
          stands and starts to tidy. He watches her. She picks up
          some clothing from near his chair and moves away. He drops
          another piece of clothing on the same spot. She says
          nothing and picks it up. He takes a sock off and drops it.
          It has stopped being a game and started being a statement.
          She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. He pushes
          it back onto the floor. She opens her arms and everything
          falls to the floor. She walks out of the room and into the
          kitchen. He follows.

                         When you're here, I spend my time
                         wondering when you're going. And
                         when you're back, I wonder where
                         you've been.
          
          She turns and walks round to face him.

                         great time. But I'm not sure if
                         that's enough.

                         You should hook up with someone

                         dinner every Friday, cleans his
                         shoes twice a week and buys his
                         ties in bulk because it works out
                         cheaper that way. I'll put you

          A suburban street of small, neat bungalows. We move down
          the street, past house and identical house, until we rest
          outside another that is identical to the rest. The front
          door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small
          overnight bag. He carefully locks the door and walks down
          the path to where a cab waits. We can clearly see 'New

          Barbara walks back into the hall.
                                   BARBARA
                         Welcome to the seventies.

                         What do you want, Barbara?
          
          Barbara lights a cigarette.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         I'm here to fulfill Gram's
                         wishes.
          
          She waits for him to speak.
          
                                   PHIL
                         That's nice. I have no idea what
                         you're talking about.
          
          She holds up an old piece of writing paper.
          
                                                               13.

          Phil reaches for it, but Barbara snatches it away.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                     It's Gram's will.
          
          She reads it out.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                     To whom it may concern: I would
                     like it to be known that it is my
                     wish to leave Barbara Mansfield
                     my assets and belongings in the
                     event of my death. Signed:
                     Ingram Cecil Parsons.
          
          Phil looks surprised.
          
                               PHIL
                     Did he write that with joined up
                     writing or was it before he knew
                     how?
          
          Barbara gives a wry smile.
          
                               BARBARA
                     Still the jester Kaufman, and
                     still very unfunny.
          
                               PHIL
                     That's not a will Barbara, and
                     you know it.
                               BARBARA
                     It's better than a will,
                     actually. It's a signed promise
                     from Gram to leave me all his
                     assets and belongings. And
                     anyway, it's really none of your
                     business what this is. I've come
                     for the guitar.
          
          Phil shakes his head.
          
                               PHIL
                     Guitar?
          
                               BARBARA
                     Yes. Gram's guitar.   He always
                     kept it here.
          
                               PHIL
                     It's been a while since you were

          Barbara leans forward until their noses are almost
          touching.
          
                               BARBARA
                     I don't believe you, Kaufman.
          
          Barbara pushes past Phil who gives no resistance. She
          walks straight over to the couch and starts pulling up the
          cushions. Susie moves to stop her, but Phil holds her back
          and lets Barbara carry on.
          
          INT. PHIL'S LOUNGE. DAY
          
          Phil and Susie sit on the sofa, an island of calm in a sea
          of chaos. Around them, the floor is covered with papers,
          clothing, empty record covers, torn open cushions and
          books. A broken drawer is propped against the table. A
          lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings, throwing strange
          shadows around the room. Suddenly, Susie gets up and kicks
          a cushion across the room.
          
                               PHIL
                     Hey, well done. You found the
                     only unbroken thing.

                               SUSIE
                     How can she behave that way?
                     Gram's not even in the ground
                     yet.
          
          Phil stares at her.

          A man with glasses and an ill-fitting black suit does some
          paperwork. He is surrounded by coffins displaying garish
          'special offer' price tickets. The phone rings, and the
          undertaker takes his time answering it.

          Phil is lying down in the back of Susie's station wagon,
          his feet sticking out of the back. Susie comes out of the
          house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she
          watches him. After a minute:

          Without a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house.
          Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her
          bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car
          door. Phil gets out of the back.

          She gets into the car and slams the door. She starts the
          engine, and Phil stands back, but the car doesn't move.
          After a moment the window winds down.

          Phil arrives on his trike outside a small house.

          A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick
          burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background.
          This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a
          loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having
          heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no
          response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye
          appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears
          and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The
          window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face
          appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.
          
                              PHIL
                        (O.S)
                    Hello? Anyone there?
          Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The
          letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.
          
                              PHIL (CONT'D)
                        (O.S)
                    There you are. I'm looking for
                    Larry Osterberg.
          
          Larry sighs, and stretches. He gets up slowly, gently
          shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door,
          which he opens.
          
                              LARRY
                    The door is unlocked.
          
          Phil barrels in and closes the door behind him.   He turns
          to take a look around the room.
                              PHIL
                    You Larry Osterberg?
          
                               LARRY
                    Yes.   Welcome to my house.
          
          This might be sarcastic, but any nuance is lost on Phil,
          who props the guitar up against the wall.
          
                                 PHIL
                    Very nice.     What's that noise?

                    Phil stares at him.
          
                                                                      19.

          He pops a cigar into his mouth.

          Phil stares meaningfully at the burning joss stick, but
          puts the cigar away.

                         Yes, of course. It's just that
                         I'm told your car is more
                         suitable.
          
                                   LARRY
                         I see. In what way is my car
                         more suitable?

                         Yes.
          
          They both look at each other.         Larry waits for Phil to
          speak.
          
                                                                20.

                               PHIL
                     No, it's more of a fifty dollar
                     surprise.
          
                               LARRY
                     I can lend you a bicycle.
                     Besides, the car is booked.

                     I use it to carry equipment for a

          Phil pulls some cash out of his pocket and sorts through
          it.
          
                               PHIL
                     Well, here's two hundred dollars

          Phil passes the money over.   Larry starts to count it.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     You don't need to count it.   You
                     could trust me.
          
          Larry doesn't pause counting.

                               PHIL
                     That last twenty is for gas.
                     Anyway - I haven't even seen the

          EXT. OUTSIDE LARRY OSTERBERG'S GARAGE. DAY
          
          The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into
          the sun. It is bright yellow and covered in painted
          flowers. One of the side windows is broken and a headlight
          hangs out. Phil's jaw drops open. Larry gets out of the
          driving seat and pats the roof, proudly.
          
                               LARRY
                     Meet Bernice.

                               LARRY
                     Bernice is a Cadillac Superior
                     Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral
                     Coach. We've got a Seven gallon

                     six hundred revolutions per

                     But they're all black.

                         So how is a yellow hearse covered
                         with flowers less of a surprise
                         than a black hearse?
          
                                   PHIL
                         I paid you two hundred dollars

                         No, you paid me a hundred and
                         eighty dollars for a hearse, and
                         a hearse is what you've got. If
                         you take a long, hard look at
                         Bernice, you'll see that she's
                         one of a kind. She's big, she's
                         fast, she's comfortable, and
                         she's beautiful. But she's not
                         black.
          
          They stare at each other for a moment.       Then Phil sighs
          deeply.
          
                                    PHIL

          Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again.

                         Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere
                         without me.
          
          Phil thinks this over.

                         Okay.   Well, let's boogie.
          
          Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps
          and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts
          the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car.

          Larry looks pleased.

          EXT. LA HIGHWAY. DAY
          
          One backfire, and Bernice is ready. The hearse weaves
          erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud
          of exhaust smoke.
          
          INT. BARBARA'S HOME. EVENING
          
          Barbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen, reading the

          EXT. LAX. EVENING
          
          The hearse drives under a huge sign which reads 'Welcome to
          Los Angeles Airport' and peels off the main road past some
          offices and cargo stores. Bernice drives into a giant
          hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office.
          
          INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING
          
          Phil glances out of the window.
          
                                      PHIL
                         Pull over.
          
          Larry parks, and Phil looks at his watch.
          
                                      PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Shit.
          
                                                                   24.

                         What's the matter?
          
                                     PHIL
                         Nothing.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Well... What flight are they on?
          
                                   PHIL
                         We'll wait here.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Okay. Well, what time is the
                         flight due?
                                     PHIL
                         Soon.
          
                                    LARRY
                         Okay.   How soon?
          
                                    PHIL
                         Why do you ask so many damn
                         questions?
          
                                   LARRY
                         Well... I don't know.
          
          There is silence.         Then:
          
                                   LARRY (CONT'D)
                         Shouldn't we be at arrivals?
          
                                   PHIL
                         Look, will you please shut up
                         asking me stuff?
          
                                     LARRY
                         Okay.
          
          He looks out of the window, and then back at Phil, who now
          has his eyes closed.
          
                                   LARRY (CONT'D)
                         So how long are we going to wait?
          
          Phil doesn't answer for a moment.      Just as Larry opens his
          mouth to ask again, Phil speaks.
          
                                     PHIL
                         Morning.
          
          Larry looks at Phil with astonishment.
          
                                                               25.

                                LARRY
                     Morning?   What do you mean,
                     morning?
          
                               PHIL
                     We'll make the pick-up in the
                     morning.
          
          Larry tries to start the car. Phil leans over and plucks
          the screwdriver from his hand. He reclines his seat and
          closes his eyes.
          
                               LARRY
                     You wait till morning.   I'm going
                     home.
          Larry opens the door and gets out of the car. He slams the
          door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom. Phil
          doesn't move.
          
          INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The drivers' door opens and Larry gets back into the car.
          
                               LARRY
                     I'm only back because I don't
                     trust you with Bernice. I don't
                     even know you, and if you think
                     I'm going to leave my car with
                     you and just walk away, then
                     you've got another thought on the
                     way.
          
          He stares at Phil, who hasn't moved an inch: eyes still
          closed, unlit cigar hanging out of the corner of his mouth,
          feet up on the dash.
          
                               LARRY (CONT'D)
                     I'm staying right here. Where I
                     can keep an eye on things...
          
          There is still no response from Phil. After a moment,
          Larry settles back in his seat and closes his eyes.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. NIGHT
          
          The hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and
          night falls.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE BARBARA'S HOME. MORNING
          
          A door swings open, and Barbara appears. She is looking
          quite stunning, with a tight black suit doing equal justice
          to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner. She
          strides down the sidewalk, and as a group of schoolchildren
          appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right.
          
                                                               26.
          CON TINUE D:
          Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to
          a halt inches away, horn blaring. The driver leans out of
          the window, furious.
          
                                      DRIVER
                         Hey, lady!
          
          Barbara stops and whips round, her hair cascading across
          her shoulders, her blue eyes flashing. The man simply
          stares at her, enchanted by her beauty.
          
                                      BARBARA
                         Yes?
          
          He continues to stare, and is only shaken back to his
          senses by a burst of abuse from further back in the road.
                                   DRIVER
                         You... should be careful.
          
          Barbara smiles.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         Why, thank you...
          
          INT. AIRPORT CHECK IN DESK - LAX. MORNING
          
          Stanley is standing at the Airport Airlines check-in desk,
          facing the check-in clerk.
          
                                      STANLEY
                         Parsons.
          
          The clerk checks her paperwork.
          
                                   CHECK-IN CLERK
                         You've just arrived from New
                         Orleans, mister Parsons?
          
                                      STANLEY
                         Yes.
          
                                   CHECK-IN CLERK
                         And you're flying directly back
                         to New Orleans? On the same
                         plane?
          
                                   STANLEY
                         That is correct.
          
          The clerk awaits an explanation, but none is forthcoming.
          She raises an eyebrow.
          
                                   CHECK-IN CLERK
                         Okay. Well, enjoy your stay at

          Stanley turns to go, but then pauses.
          
                                   STANLEY (CONT'D)
                         I've come to pick up my son's
                         body.
          
          The line behind him falls quiet, and the officious clerk
          wobbles slightly. Stanley raises his voice.
          
                                   STANLEY (CONT'D)
                         My son died out here, you see?
                         So I've come to bring him home.
          Everyone looks at Stanley.            Stanley looks at the clerk.
          
                                   STANLEY (CONT'D)
                         I'm wondering if that's enough
                         information for you?
          
                                   CHECK-IN CLERK
                         Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. We'll...
                         see to it that you get every
                         assistance on your journey, sir.
          
                                      STANLEY
                         Most kind.
          
          INT. BANK. MORNING
          
          There is a line leading to the information desk, but
          Barbara ignores it. She walks up to a female teller, who
          is serving another customer, and cuts in.
                                   BARBARA
                         I'd like to see the manager,
                         please.
          
                                   CUSTOMER
                         Wait your turn.
          
          Barbara's eyes immediately water, and her lower lip
          trembles.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         I'm sorry. It's just that the
                         man I loved died yesterday. I
                         was forgetting my manners...
          
          She dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief.           The
          customer looks embarrassed.
          
                                      CUSTOMER

          Barbara fixes the teller with a no-nonsense look.   The

                                   BARBARA

          A man unlocks the shutters with a clatter and goes inside.
          
          INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          The sound wakes Phil, who glances around and stretches,
          before getting out of the car.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING
          Phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary.
          
          INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          The clerk busies himself opening up. Phil wanders around
          and knocks into a coffin. The lid bangs closed and the
          sound echoes around the hangar.
          
                                   CLERK
                         Can I help you?

                         I'm here to pick up a... coffin.
          
          The clerk looks Phil over. He's dressed in denim, with
          scuffed Harley-Davidson cowboy boots, topped off with a cut-
          down denim jacket with 'Sin City' stitched into the back.
                                   CLERK
                         No you're not.
          
                                     PHIL
                         Yes I am.
          
                                  CLERK
                         No. You're here to pick up a
                         casket.
          
          Phil looks irritated.
          
                                    PHIL
                         Okay.   A casket.

          The clerk turns and shouts over his shoulder.
          
                                   CLERK

          INT. BANK - MANAGER'S OFFICE. MORNING
          The Bank Manager is staring at the piece of paper.
          
                                   BANK MANAGER
                         I simply can't give you any money
                         based on this piece of paper.
          
          Barbara is totally calm.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         It's not a piece of paper. It's
                         a promise from Gram to leave me
                         all his money.
          
                                   BANK MANAGER
                         Well, I'm sorry, but it's highly
                         likely that the estate will go to
                         probate and be divided up
                         accordingly, subject to a valid
                         will existing.
          
                                                               30.

          She just looks at him.      He tries again.
          
                                   BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
                         Mister Parsons was a customer of
                         ours. We can't just pass his
                         money across to someone who says
                         they're in the will. There
                         are... rules.
          
          Barbara, realizing that she's getting nowhere, starts to
          cry.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         You don't seem to understand.
                         These are his wishes.
          Barbara is now sobbing, and the bank manager is becoming
          increasing uncomfortable. He gives her his handkerchief.
          
                                   BANK MANAGER
                         No... I do... understand, Miss
                         Mansfield. Really I do.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         Please tell me how I'm supposed
                         to get my money.
          
                                   BANK MANAGER
                         Well I imagine that you first
                         need to prove that mister Parsons
                         is actually dead.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         Are you saying that I'm lying?
                                   BANK MANAGER
                         No, absolutely not. But getting
                         a copy of the death certificate
                         would probably be a good first
                         step.
          
          INT. PLANE - LAX. MORNING
          
          Stanley takes a swig from a hip flask and looks out of the
          window. A very overweight, red-faced man squeezes into the
          next seat. He bangs Stanley with his knee as he sits, but
          Stanley doesn't move. He peers at Stanley and shuffles in
          his seat, but there is still no reaction. Next, a deep
          sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly
          keen to start a conversation. Stanley keeps looking out of
          the window. He is watching the cargo being loaded.
          
                                   P. J. GAMBRELL
                         Paw on the space, don'tcha think?
          
          Stanley turns slowly.
          
                                                                   31.

                         I'm sorry?
          
          The fat man smiles and extends a chubby hand, which Stanley
          shakes awkwardly and reluctantly.
          
                                   P. J. GAMBRELL
                         P J Gambrell, at yer assistance.

                         on the space in dese buckets.
          
          Stanley is obviously having problems fully understanding
          what is being said. After a moment:
          
                                   STANLEY
                         Stanley Parsons.

                         Yes.   I suppose so.
          
          INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          The clerk scribbles on a form.
          
                                      CLERK
                         Papers?

                         They'll be along. With this
                         being a rush job, they said you'd
                         understand.
          He passes a folded banknote across.      The clerk pockets it
          without a change of expression.
          
                                   CLERK
                         Well, you'd better tell them that
                         we've got rules.
          
          The men stare at each other. Then Phil pulls another note
          out of his pocket and passes that over. Again, the clerk
          pockets it.
          
                                   CLERK (CONT'D)
                         And this is the exception which
                         proves that particular rule.
          
          A beat.   Then:
          
                                    CLERK (CONT'D)
                         Although you don't need to tell
                         them that.

          Phil smiles broadly at him. The clerk turns and selects a
          casket from a gurney behind the counter.
          
                                   CLERK (CONT'D)
                         And this... is your deceased.
          
          INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          Phil is wheeling a casket on a gurney down the middle of
          the hangar. He can see Larry peering through the window at
          him. He can also see a uniformed policeman approaching
          Larry from the other side of the street. As he speeds up
          to try and reach Larry first, the clerk calls out from his
          desk.
          
                                   CLERK
                         Good luck with her.
          
          Phil closes his eyes and slows to a halt.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          Larry is jumping up and down nervously outside the window.
          The policeman appears at his shoulder.
          
                                   COP
                         Excuse me, sir.    Is that your
                         hearse?
          
          Larry turns slowly.
          
                                    LARRY
                         Hearse?
          
          The cop points at Bernice.
                                   COP
                         That hearse.
          
          Larry has started to sweat profusely.
          
                                   LARRY
                         That hearse?
          
          The cop looks at him carefully.
          
                                   COP
                         Are you okay, sir?
          
                                    LARRY
                         Okay?   Sure...
          
          He leans against the window for support.
          
                                                                 33.

          Stanley is looking out of the plane's window, but the fat
          man is now locked on. He gestures around him.
          
                              PJ GAMBRELL
                    Jes sayin' 'bout the space.
          
          Another thoughtful pause from Stanley.
          
                               STANLEY
                    Yes.
          
          He glances out at the cargo loaders.
          
                              PJ GAMBRELL

                    Right.
          
                              PJ GAMBRELL

                               STANLEY
                    I see.
          
          He leans forward to watch a loader wheeling a casket
          towards the back of the plane.
          
                              PJ GAMBRELL
                    What's your bidness?
          Stanley watches the coffin and doesn't answer. A tear
          rolls down his face. The fat man pulls some candy out of
          his pocket and takes a bite.
          
          INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          Phil and the clerk peer into the open casket.
          
                               PHIL
                    Yup.   That's a she.

                    Yeah...
          
          The clerk walks back to the counter and peers at his
          paperwork.
          
                                                                       34.

                         box back?
          
          The clerk raises an eyebrow.         Phil understands immediately.
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         You're a damn thief.

                         That's very hurtful.
          
          Phil reluctantly hands another note over and the clerk
          speaks into a radio.

          Larry is standing by the hearse.          The cop is reading his
          license.
          
                                   COP

          INT. PLANE - LAX. MORNING
          
          Stanley has his eyes closed. The fat man eats. Suddenly,
          Stanley's eyes snap open and he peers out of the window. A
          motorized cart chugs into view with the casket covered in a
          blanket on the back. It is driving away from the plane.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         What the hell?
          
          He stands up and turns to the fat man.
          
                                      STANLEY (CONT'D)

          The fat man reluctantly struggles to his feet and squeezes
          out into the aisle.

          Phil glances nervously out to where Larry is being
          interrogated by the cop. The clerk is reading a paper.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Can you speed things up?
                                   CLERK
                         What's the hurry?
          
          Phil is distracted, watching the cop and Larry out of the
          window.
          
                                   PHIL
                         I'd like to get to the Joshua
                         Tree while it's still light.
          
          The clerk looks up.
          
                                   CLERK
                         I thought you were taking him to
                         New Orleans?
          
                                     PHIL
                         What?
                                   CLERK
                         When you came in, you said you
                         were driving the casket out to
                         New Orleans. But just now you
                         said you were headed for the
                         Joshua Tree...
          
          Phil is under pressure.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Joshua Tree, yeah.
          
          A buzzer sounds.         No-one moves.

                         community struggling to get by.
          
          The buzzer goes again, and Phil attempts to change the
          subject.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Use your phone?
          
          After a moment, the clerk nods towards the phone on the
          desk, before turning and disappearing into the rear of the
          mortuary. Phil wipes some sweat from his forehead, picks
          up the phone and dials.
          
          INT. PHIL'S LOUNGE. MORNING
          Susie is packing. The phone rings and she hesitates for a
          moment. Then she continues loading her case, leaving the
          phone unanswered.
          
          INT. CHECK IN DESK. DAY
          
          Stanley tries to ask a question at the check in desk, but
          gives up and walks toward an exit.
          
          INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          The clerk returns with a casket on a gurney and Phil
          replaces the receiver as the clerk flips open the top of
          the casket and peers inside.

                         you.
          
          He wheels the casket over and Phil has a quick look inside.
          
                                   CLERK (CONT'D)
                         Need you to sign for it again.

          Phil again glances out of the window.
          
                                                                    37.

          The cop is wandering around the hearse.    Larry trails
          behind him, disconsolately.
          
                              COP
                    I don't like the look of you.

                    Right.   Good saying.
          
          He prods at the broken light with his baton.

                    Yes.   It's a... surprise.
          
                               COP
                    Which parts the surprise: The
                    fact that you're in a bright
                    yellow hearse, the fact that
                    you're dressed like something out
                    of a horror film, or the fact
                    that you're half a mile from the
                    terminal and they're gonna have
                    to walk across two runways to
                    reach you?
          
          Larry is looking increasingly desperate.
          
                                                               38.

                         Well... the first part.
          
          The cop nods and repeats it to himself.
          
                                   COP
                         The first part.
          
          They stare at each other.
          
                                   COP (CONT'D)
                         Okay, now why don't you tell me
                         what the hell's going on?
          
                                     LARRY
                         Going on?
          They stare at each other. The cop shifts position and
          purses his lips. Larry stares at the ground looking for
          some kind of inspiration. Just when the silence moves
          beyond uncomfortable, the door of the mortuary opens and
          Phil clatters out with the casket.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Well, I don't care if it is first
                         thing in the morning - but I sure
                         need a coffee. I tell you, I've
                         never seen so many darned bits of
                         paper to sign! It's paperwork
                         which is slowing this great
                         country down. We're drowning in
                         triplicate!
          
          He's busying himself at the back of the hearse, and appears
          to notice the cop for the first time.
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Good morning officer.
          
          The cop peers at him suspiciously.
          
                                     COP
                         Mornin'.

                         I was just saying how people with
                         work to do - people like
                         yourself, officer - are just
                         getting engulfed by paper. Grab
                         the end, will you? Doesn't that
                         just drive you plain crazy?
          
          The cop hesitates and then takes the end of the casket and
          helps load it into the hearse.
          
                                                               39.

          Phil gestures at Larry to get into the car, which he does.
          
                               PHIL
                     One casket, six sheets to sign.
                     Six! That can't be right. Does
                     that sound right to you?
          
          He closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat.

          It looks like they've got away with it.   But:

                     You see the gentleman we're
                     meeting from the plane doesn't
                     yet know about the sad passing of
                     his... aunt.

                     flight with her coffin?
          
          He raises an eyebrow.
          
                                                               40.

                     for the avoidance of doubt.
          
          He gestures at Larry to start the car. Larry pulls out the
          screwdriver and starts to jig it about in the ignition.
          The cop watches. As the engine refuses to catch, Larry
          starts to panic.
          
                               LARRY
                     Ignition's a bit temperamental.

                     We'd best be off...
          
          He looks meaningfully at the cop, who grudgingly moves
          back. As they move off, Stanley hurries round the corner
          with his overnight bag in his hand.

                                   LARRY
                         I don't like them and I don't
                         know what to say to them. They
                         make me feel uneasy.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Well of course they make you feel
                         uneasy. They're supposed to make
                         you feel uneasy.
          
          Larry sulks. Phil shakes his head and glances back at the
          cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar
          wall.
          EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          We pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry has
          missed.
          
          INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          They both sit there, staring out of the windshield at the
          wall.
          
                                   PHIL
                         You hit the wall.
          
                                   LARRY
                         I clipped it. I clipped the
                         wall.
          
                                   PHIL

                         There's a gap fifty yards wide!
                         You just had to aim for the gap.
                         How could you miss the gap?
          
                                   LARRY
                             (babbles)
                         I was distracted. We're supposed
                         to be picking someone up and you
                         arrive with a coffin and I'd only
                         just woken up and...
          
          The cop peers in at the window and gestures at Phil to wind
          it down. As he does, the glass falls out.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Hello, officer. I guess they
                         make these hearses wider than
                         they need to...
          
          The cop ignores him and concentrates on Larry.
          
                                                                      42.

          Larry swallows hard.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Uh, not at this time, no sir.
          
                                   COP
                         Not at this time. Okay, well
                         let's see. You just missed a gap
                         of fifty yards and hit a wall in
                         broad daylight. Why was that?
          
          Larry licks his lips.
                                      LARRY
                         Well...
          
          Pause.   Phil wills him to speak.
          
                                      PHIL
                         Well...
          
          Still nothing. Larry looks like he's trying to form words,
          but nothing emerges.
          
                                   COP

          The radio in his car crackles into life. We - and he - are
          too far away to hear what is said. He is torn for a
          moment, but then:
          
                                      COP (CONT'D)
                         Wait.
          
          He walks back to his car.           Phil shakes his head.
          
                                      PHIL
                         Fantastic.     Well done.
          
                                      LARRY
                         Oh, right.     So it's all my fault?
          
                                   PHIL
                         You... you just drove into a
                         wall! Of course it's your fault.
                         Jesus!
          
          They both stare out of the window at the cop, who is
          talking animatedly into his radio. Then the flashing
          lights and siren go on.

          The police car drives up to, and then past, the hearse,
          before disappearing out of the hanger at speed. Phil and
          Larry look at each other.
          
                                  PHIL (CONT'D)
                     Well?
          
                                  LARRY
                     Well what?
          
                               PHIL
                     Well, what are we doing now?
          
                               LARRY
                     He said to wait.
          Phil just stares at him. After a moment, Larry reverses
          Bernice and then drives the battered car through the gap
          and out of the hangar. Phil slumps back in his seat.
          
                               PHIL
                     Nice going, hippie. Went right
                     through the gap that time.
          
          Larry says nothing.     Phil leans back in his seat.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     Well, we got it. Whoooh!!!
          
          Larry slams the brakes on and the huge car skids to a halt
          in a cloud of dust. Phil is flung forward in his seat.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     Jesus... What now?
                                  LARRY
                     Get out.

                     What are you talking about?
          
          He looks nervously out of the back window.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     C'mon, we gotta keep moving.
          
                               LARRY

                     throw me out onto the street with
                     a coffin.
          Larry slips the car into gear and it moves forward.
          
                                  PHIL (CONT'D)
                     Thank God.
          
          Larry makes a U-turn.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     What the hell are you doing?
          
                               LARRY
                     I'm driving back to the mortuary.
          
                               PHIL
                     You can't do that.
          
          Nearly at the turn now. Phil opens the car door with a
          mind to jump out, but one look at the fast-moving road
          changes his mind. He glowers at Larry and shuts the door.
          The hearse skids round the corner, Larry slams on the
          brakes and the car slides to a halt outside the mortuary.
          
                                  LARRY
                     Talk.

                     What talk?
          
          Larry gestures towards the back of the car.

          woman in a suit. Her allure appears lost on the official,
          who gives the dress a disapproving look.

          With a flourish, Barbara places a copy of the LA Times on
          the table. The headline is 'Country-Rock Pioneer Dead' in
          large black print. The official glances at it and gives a

          INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
          
          Stanley and the clerk are staring at each other.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         You just gave the body away?
          
                                   CLERK
                         Well, it's not like this is a
                         bank. People round here don't
                         generally take dead bodies
                         they're not entitled to.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         Why did you give it to him?
          
                                                                        47.

                                   STANLEY
                         Who signed for it?
          
          The clerk peers at his paperwork.        When he eventually
          speaks, it is wearily.
          
                                   CLERK
                         John Nobody.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         And where do I find this John
                         Nobody?
          The clerk's attention switches to a point just above
          Stanley's shoulder. He points out through the window to
          where the hearse is parked over a hundred yards away.
          
                                   CLERK

          Larry is staring at Phil.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Empty?
          
                                   PHIL
                         Absolutely, completely, totally.
          
                                   LARRY
                         It looked pretty heavy, for an
                         empty casket.
          
                                   PHIL
                         They are made of finest...
                         poplar. That's very heavy wood.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Poplar? No way?   Mahogany, or
                         oak, but not...
          
                                   PHIL
                         Look, I'm not going to argue with
                         you now. Poplar is very well
                         suited to the making of coffins.
          
          Larry stares hard at Phil. We see the door of the mortuary
          open over Larry's shoulder and Stanley and the clerk
          emerge. Then:
          
                                                                    48.

                         Okay. So why have we got an
                         empty coffin in the back of the
                         car?
          
          Phil glances at the approaching Stanley.
          
                                   PHIL
                         I'm... selling them on to a
                         company in Palm Springs. Lots of
                         stiffs, lots of money. And then
                         of course, it's very
                         environmentally sound. And...
                         look, under the circumstances,
                         perhaps we should renegotiate the
                         financial arrangement between us.
          Larry still stares at Phil.      Stanley is almost at the car.
          
                                    PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Fifty-fifty? That baby's worth
                         two grand.
          
          Stanley is getting ever closer. Phil can see him in his
          wing mirror. Larry releases the safety brake and the giant
          car roars away, leaving Stanley standing in a cloud of
          dust.

          Larry drives. Phil is still pitching.        They are driving
          alongside the airport runway.

          and calls from outside.

          The tank is full, and the attendant screws the cap back on.

          passes it to the guy.

          winks.

          The man gapes at him. Larry walks over to the car and Phil
          gets into the passenger seat. He passes some money to the
          attendant and takes the can.

                         This little number is for

                         Oh, one of those.   Like a well-
                         paid gopher.
          
                                   PHIL
                         No, not like a well-paid gopher.
                         I'm responsible for movement,
                         maintenance and management. I'm
                         a confidante and a companion, a
                         partner and a patron, an ally,
                         agent and ambassador. I'm like
                         an executive nanny. Not a
                         gopher.
          
          Larry backs down with hint of sarcasm
          
                                   LARRY
                         An executive nanny, not a gopher.
                         Thanks for clearing that up.

          and Barbara is standing outside.

                         the desert.

          The hearse is parked by the side of the road, near a
          rickety stall where an old lady sits, selling melons.
          Larry sits inside and Phil walks to a phone by the side of
          the road. He dials.
          
          INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
          
          The girls are still arguing.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         You'll learn about Phil Kaufman.
                         If you stick around long enough.
          
                                   SUSIE
                         And you know him?
                                   BARBARA
                         I know he's a brainless,
                         interfering asshole, yes.
          
                                   SUSIE
                         I don't need to listen to this
                         garbage.
          
          The phone starts to ring. Susie instinctively moves
          towards it, then stops. Barbara watches carefully.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         That's him, isn't it?

                         Generally, it's best to answer
                         the phone to discover who's
                         calling.
          
          She still makes no move to answer it.

                         Hello Kaufman. I know what
                         you're up to, you thieving
                         bastard. I know where you're
                         going, and I know about your
                         sick, revolting plans, and I'm
                         coming after you. And when I
                         catch you...

                         Hello Barbara. How nice to hear
                         from you again. And so soon...
          
          Suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs
          out. Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's
          shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. He
          watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently
          sick. He glances across to where the old melon woman
          watches, expressionless, from her stall. After a moment,
          Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Sorry Barb, gotta go.
          
          He goes to replace the receiver, and then pops in a last
          comment.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         It's been real, though.
          
          He puts the phone down, cutting off Barbara's squawk and
          watches Larry get into the hearse. He frowns.
          
                                                                   56.

          Barbara slams the phone down. Then she picks up the
          receiver again and smashes it onto the table.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Sonofabitch!
          
          She walks to the door, brushing past Susie.   Then she
          stops.
          
                              BARBARA (CONT'D)
                    Okay, honey. Do you want to see
                    who Phil Kaufman really is? Do
                    you want to see what he's capable
                    of?
          Barbara shows Susie the door.
          
                              BARBARA (CONT'D)
                    Or maybe you already know I'm
                    right.
          
          Susie hesitantly dismisses the challenge.
          
                              SUSIE
                    You don't know shit about him.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Well why don't we find out?
          
          Barbara turns and walks out.    Susie looks at her packed
          bags then follows.
          
          INT. HEARSE. DAY
          Phil gets into the hearse, looks back at the coffin and
          sniffs. He looks down at the air conditioning and turns it
          up full. Larry starts the engine and the car stalls.
          
                              PHIL

                    You've hardly left the car since

          at a small road that heads off into the desert.

                         a hearse pass this way in the
                         last couple of hours?
          
                                   OLD WOMAN
                         What's it look like?
          
          The question throws Stanley.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         Well... It... It's a big car. A
                         big yellow car. Two guys inside.
          
                                   OLD WOMAN
                         Was one of 'em sick in them
                         bushes?
          
                                   STANLEY
                         Well... I don't know.   Maybe.
          
          The old woman nods.
          
                                    OLD WOMAN
                         Yup.   I seen it.

          Larry drives and talks, Phil looks tense.

                         See, the Yin is the negative -
                         the darkside. And the Yang
                         represents positive - good. If
                         you like, the first is earth and
                         the second heaven.

          Larry still talks.       Phil now looks bored.
          
                                   LARRY
                         The Yin Yang symbol is really
                         evocative about the whole
                         concept. As you travel around
                         the circle, white or black will
                         increase until the opposite color
                         is almost gone. But never
                         totally gone, right? And this
                         cycle then repeats for the
                         opposite color.
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
                                                               59.

          Larry still talks, glancing across to Phil to make his
          point every now and then. Phil is tossing a cigarette into
          the air and trying to catch it between his teeth.
          
                              LARRY
                    What seems like Yin is often
                    supported by Yang, and vice
                    versa. Let me give you an
                    example: To truly know good, you
                    must first know evil, and without
                    good as a comparison, nothing can
                    be evil. So by allowing Yin to
                    flourish, you welcome Yan. By
                    letting go of Yin, you are
                    waiting for its return. Another
                    example is...
          
          There is a crash, and the car slams to a halt. Larry is
          thrown forward, but manages to grab the wheel. Phil is not
          so lucky, and catapults into the dashboard, before being
          thrown back into his seat, the crumpled cigarette still
          gripped between his teeth.

          Bernice has driven into a road sign set into a concrete
          pillar. In fact, the sign that Bernice has driven into is
          the only thing anywhere near the road for miles in any
          direction.

          Phil is dazed. He checks his forehead, which is bleeding.
          Then he gazes out at the desolate road and the solitary,
          buckled sign.
          
                              PHIL
                    It would be really nice if we
                    could get through a couple of
                    hours without crashing the car.
          
                              LARRY
                    I was distracted.
          
          Phil looks out of the window at the vast expanse of nothing
          but desert.
          
                              PHIL
                    Of course you were.
          
                                                                     60.

          There is a faint noise. Larry hears it first and then Phil
          and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny
          dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as
          they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identify
          it and... it's a motorcycle cop.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         I don't believe it. Middle of
                         nowhere, and... quick - stand in
                         front of the car!

          They jump out of the car and shuffle sideways, until they
          are standing in front of the actual point of collision.
                                     LARRY
                         What now?
          
                                   PHIL
                         Pretend we're having a
                         conversation.
          
          The buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both
          grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner.
          
                                    LARRY
                         Okay.   What about?
          
                                   PHIL
                         I don't know what about! Ever
                         since I met you, you've talked.
                         Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking
                         minute. Religion, your
                         supersonic, supercharged car, the
                         darkside. Now you need to talk,
                         and you can't think of anything
                         to say.
          
          The cop slows down but drives past.        Phil waves at him.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Whatever your damn fool religion
                         is called, I think it works.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Well... it's more a philosophy
                         than a religion.
          
          The cop does a U-turn and motors towards them.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Oh, well done. Good work.
          
          He shoots a vicious look at Larry.      The cop parks his bike
          and removes his helmet.
          
                                                                      61.

                         going today?
          
          The sign gives an ominous creak.         Larry takes a sideways
          step, out of danger.
          
                                   MOTORCYCLE COP
                         Oh, it's going fine, thank you.

                         got around here.
          
          The cop takes his sunglasses off and takes a look around,
          as if it's the first time he's seen it.

          They all look appreciatively at the desert, and the cop
          glances down at the keys in Larry's hand.

                         today, sir?
          
          Larry looks flustered.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Ooooh, I'm well. Really well,
                         actually. Thank you.
          
          The cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at Larry with a
          pleasant half-smile on his face.
          
                                   MOTORCYCLE COP
                         The reason I ask, is that you

          Larry wobbles with shock.
          
                                  LARRY
                     A body?     Stole a body?

          The cop ignores him.        Phil lights his cigar.

                     they're supposed to be driving
                     out this way.

          He looks to Phil for support.   Phil raises an eyebrow.
                               PHIL
                     I think he's onto us, Larry.
                     He's just having a little fun at
                     our expense.
          
          The cop is no longer smiling.

          Phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into
          the road. They get into the car and the cop cuffs them
          together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys.
          Then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into
          the radio.

                     He didn't say 'coffin'. He said
                     'body'. Tell me we haven't
                     stolen a real person.
          
                                                                     64.

                         Look, the place that I get the
                         coffins from probably haven't
                         filed a report yet. It'll all be
                         sorted out within the hour.
                         Trust me.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Oh, I'm just overflowing with
                         trust for you, man. I feel this
                         overwhelming feeling of... trust
                         every time I look at you.
          
          He shakes his head.
          
                                   LARRY (CONT'D)
                         I'm gonna check inside that box
                         just as soon as we're out of
                         here.
          
          They both stare out of the window.        Phil bangs the cuffs
          against the wheel.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Jesus!
          
          They sit glowering out of different windows at different
          bits of desert. The motorcycle cop can be heard talking
          into his radio.
          
                                   LARRY
                         What are we going to do?
          
                                   PHIL
                         Time.
                                   LARRY
                         What?
          
                                   PHIL
                             (bitterly)
                         We're going to be arrested,
                         that's what we're going to do.
                         Then we'll go to court and then
                         we'll go to jail and we'll do
                         that for a while.
          
          Larry mulls this over.
          
                                   LARRY
                         What about if I could slip out of
                         these cuffs?
          
          Phil treats the theoretical question with indifference.
          
                                                               65.
          CON TINUE D: (2)
          
                               PHIL
                     Yeah, that would be great. Then
                     we could suspend you from a
                     bridge in a straitjacket and set
                     the rope on fire.
          
                               LARRY
                     No, really. I really can slip
                     these cuffs.
          
          He has Phil's attention now.
          
                                PHIL
                     Okay.   Show me.
          
          Larry pops his middle finger out of its socket, squeezes
          his hand and slides it out of the handcuff. He hands the
          other cuff to Phil, who stares at him in astonishment.
          
                               LARRY
                     Do you think we should go?
          
                               PHIL
                     Yes, I think we should go.
          
          Larry starts the car. He throws it into reverse and the
          bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. Suddenly
          the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the
          cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its
          trailing wire. Larry slams on the brakes.
          
                                LARRY
                     Oh shit.
          
                               PHIL
                     Nicely done.
          
          He rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is
          staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     We'll be moving on, now that your
                     sign no longer appears to be
                     impeding our forward progress.
          
          Bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a
          wide ark and circles the smashed bike. The cop chases
          them.
          
          INT. HEARSE. DAY
          
          Phil screams at Larry.
          
                               PHIL
                     What the hell are you doing?
          
                                                                 66.

                         I can't - he's got the keys.
          
          Phil turns to watch the chasing policeman.
          
                                   PHIL
                         So, we've escaped but we can only
                         drive in a circle?
          
                                    LARRY
                         Yes.
          
          EXT. DESERT. DAY
          
          They do another circuit. The exhausted cop stops,
          breathing heavily, and then watches in astonishment as the
          hearse turns and heads back towards him.
          
          INT. HEARSE. DAY
          
          Phil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window as
          the car sweeps past. The cop gets his gun out of his
          holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out
          the screwdriver. He leans across Larry, jams it into the
          wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two. The
          hearse's direction immediately changes.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Can we please go?
                                    LARRY
                         Okay.

          The hearse roars away and the cop watches it go.

          Barbara drives and Susie sits in the passenger seat.   It
          doesn't look as if they've spoken for hours.

                         Well, that's really touching.
                         But... you've got to come to
                         terms with the fact that he's
                         dead.
          
          Barbara shoots her a withering look.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         I know he's dead, Honey. But he
                         hasn't been officially
                         identified, and there's no
                         certificate of death.

                         I don't understand.

                         Let's just say I'm overly
                         sentimental, okay?
          
                                   SUSIE
                         This is all about money, isn't
                         it?
          
                                   BARBARA
                         Isn't everything?

                         Why do you think you deserve
                         anything?
          
                                   BARBARA
                         I was a great support to Gram
                         before Kaufman came along and
                         spoiled the party.
          
                                   SUSIE
                         Phil's not responsible for your
                         problems with Gram.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         What do you know?
          
                                   SUSIE
                         I know that he can be a pain in
                         the ass, but when it came to
                         Gram, Phil only ever did the
                         right thing.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         In his whole life, Phil Kaufman
                         didn't do anything because it was
                         the right thing to do. You can
                         bet the ranch that wherever he
                         is, he's having some fun.

                               BARBARA
                     Sure it is, honey. That's why
                     your bags were packed.
          
                               SUSIE
                     Have you any idea what it's like
                     to really love someone?
          
          Barbara laughs.
          
                               BARBARA
                     You might exclusively love Phil
                     Kaufman - but unfortunately, so
                     does he. You're just handy to
                     have around.
          
                               SUSIE
                     I don't have to listen to this.
          
          Susie leans over, grabs the safety brake and pulls it up
          hard. The car swerves and skids to a stop.
          
                               SUSIE (CONT'D)
                     Okay, you vindictive bitch. I'm
                     going with you to Joshua Tree
                     because my life seems to have
                     been turned upside down and I
                     want to know why. But you don't
                     know me and I won't let you judge
                     me. Do it again and I'll smash
                     that pretty little face of yours
                     off the fucking road. Got it?
          
          Barbara dismisses her anger with a tight little smile.
          
                               BARBARA
                     The truth can hurt, can't it?

          Phil finishes his beer, rubs his eyes and slumps back in
          his seat. He looks terrible, but not as bad as Larry who
          is pasty and sweating.
          
                               LARRY
                     Well, that's it! They're going

                         over that cop's bike. That's
                         destruction of police property,
                         or something.

          Phil finishes his beer and peers at the empty bottle. Then
          something catches his eye and he leans forward in his seat.

                         It's a dinosaur.

          As they get nearer, they can see that the huge model is
          carrying a sign.

          The hearse pulls up around the back of the building, and
          parks in a place that is hidden from the road. Phil gets
          out and stretches. He is joined by Larry, and they both
          peer round the side of the building to check that they have
          not been observed. Then they walk towards the entrance.

          INT. KITCHEN - THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY
          
          We are with a short-order cook. He expertly flips a burger
          from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with
          bacon, sausage and fries. He slips this plate onto a tray
          on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of
          plain bread and some lettuce. He dings a bell and a waiter
          enters and picks up the tray. We move with the tray as he
          carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. He
          stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and
          a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and
          Larry, who are sitting in a window booth. Larry has his
          head resting on the table. He lifts it as soon as the food
          arrives.
          
                               PHIL

          They both look at Larry's bread and lettuce.

          Phil picks up the first beer and downs it in one go.
          
          INT. STANLEY'S CAR. DAY.
          Stanley is driving along the road. He puts his hand in his
          pocket, takes out his hip flask, pops the lid and goes to
          take a drink. It's empty. Then he notices the dinosaur.
          
          INT. THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY
          
          Phil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the third
          beer. He gets up. Larry notices he hasn't eaten anything.
          
                                   LARRY
                         I thought you were hungry.

          He glances around and then walks over to the bar.

          He jerks his head by way of direction. Phil wanders off
          just as the door opens and Stanley walks in.

                         He said someone took Gram
                         Parson's body. Two people...
          
                                   PHIL
                         Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth.
                         In fact, I thought he was never
                         gonna stop talking. Anyway,
                         although that's real interesting,
                         we've gotta keep to the schedule.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Schedule? What schedule?   There
                         is no schedule...
          
                                   PHIL
                         Well, I think we should just make
                         our delivery as soon as possible,
                         don't you? Get our package to
                         Palm Springs. Remember?
          
          Larry looks horrified.
          
                                    LARRY
                         Package?   We've stolen that man's
                         son.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Stolen... his son? That's
                         outrageous! I'm appalled that
                         you could even think we'd do such
                         a thing.
          
          They move round the back of the Polyonax Place, where
          Bernice is hidden behind an outhouse.
          
                                   LARRY
                         I don't know what you take me
                         for. I want to see in that box.
          
          Larry walks round to the back of the car.
          
                                   PHIL
                         We've really got to go.
          
          Larry swings open the back window and pulls at the casket.
          
                                   LARRY
                         It's heavy.
          
                                                                76.

                               PHIL
                     Okay, then. Well, if you're
                     satisfied, let's go.
          
                               LARRY
                     I said it's heavy.
          
                               PHIL
                     Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of
                     wood. Wood is heavy. Actually.
          
                               LARRY
                     Yeah, I remember.    Finest poplar.
          Larry slides the top of the casket off and looks inside.
          He recoils.

                     Jesusjesusjesus...
          
          He drops the lid and looks at Phil, horrified.   Phil walks
          over and looks inside.
          
                               PHIL
                     Gosh, they must have given us a
                     full one. We'll have to sort
                     that all out when we get to Palm
                     Springs and...
          
          Larry is staring at him with horror.
          
                                  LARRY
                     Oh my God.     You stole Gram
                     Parsons.
          
          Phil gives up.
          
                               PHIL
                     Well, technically, we stole Gram
                     Parsons.
          
                               LARRY
                     I stole a coffin, I didn't know
                     there was a body in it.
          
                               PHIL
                     I'd save that line for court.
          
          As the enormity of the news starts to sink in, Larry hops
          up and down in panic. Phil watches him.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     What are you doing now?

                     I don't know! What am I doing?
                     I mean... What-am-I-doing? Why
                     am I here? Why am I with you?
                     WHAT IS GOING ON?
          
                                  PHIL
                     Calm down.
          
                               LARRY
                     I thought it was bad enough when
                     I ran over the cop's bike, but
                     now I'm a fucking body snatcher.
                               PHIL
                     Well, when you've quite finished,
                     we should go.
          
          Larry goggles at him.     His voice takes on a level of
          hysteria.
          
                               LARRY
                     Go? You go. I tell you what I'm
                     going to do. I'm going inside
                     and I'm going to give that man
                     his son back. I'm going to do
                     the right thing, I'm going to
                     follow my conscience, I'm going
                     to...
          
          Larry walks towards the bar, then quick walks, then runs.
          Phil tackles him around the legs and they both fall.
          Larry's head hits the ground hard and he lies there
          unconscious.
          
                                  PHIL
                     Shit!
          
          Phil picks him up, slings him into the passenger seat, and
          slides behind the wheel. The hearse moves off.

          Stanley takes another drink and glances out of the window,
          just as the bright yellow hearse drives past. He stands up
          and walks to the window.
          
                               STANLEY

                              SUSIE
                    It might get you further.
                              BARBARA
                    I do okay. Listen, I was an
                    orphan at fourteen and a waitress
                    at fifteen. I do what I do
                    because it puts food on my table,
                    and because if I don't look after
                    myself, no-one else will.
          
                              SUSIE
                    So what do you want from us?
          
                              BARBARA
                    I don't want anything from you.
                    It would be a bonus to see
                    Kaufman crash and burn, but I
                    don't need to be there when it
                    happens.
                              SUSIE
                    Why do you hate Phil so much?
          
          Barbara lights another cigarette.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Gram was the first good guy I
                    ever hooked up with. He wasn't
                    perfect, but it worked between
                    us. We just seemed to fit
                    together. But Gram was already
                    wild, and I made him wilder.
                    Kaufman watched over him like a
                    hawk, and when he felt things
                    were getting out of control, he
                    turned Gram against me. I lost
                    the only decent thing in my life.
          
                              SUSIE

                         That's fine. I just want what's

                         sitting here, driving your bones
                         out into the desert?

                         You've missed the point. See, it
                         doesn't matter what he would do,
                         or what you and your tie-dyed
                         friends think is the correct way
                         to behave. To me, it only
                         matters what I do. Where you
                         have boundaries and limits and
                         thresholds - I only have right
                         and wrong. If I make a promise,
                         I keep it - that's right. If I
                         break that promise - that's
                         wrong.
          
          Phil rubs his eyes, tired. Suddenly, Larry smashes Phil
          across the head with a bottle of Jack Daniels. Phil slumps
          back in the seat and Larry, dropping the bloodied weapon,
          reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse.
          
                                                               81.
          
          
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT
          
          Bernice fishtails across the road as Larry struggles to
          retain control. It eventually slides to a halt. Larry
          gets out and runs round to the drivers' door.
          
          INT. HEARSE. NIGHT
          
          Larry stares down at Phil.
          
                                LARRY
                    Ohmygod.
          
          He slides Phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel.
          He shouts at the unconscious Phil.
                              LARRY (CONT'D)
                    You made me do it, you bastard!
                    I've never hit anyone in my life,
                    but you pushed and you pushed
                    and... you gave me no choice.
          
          Larry prods Phil to ensure he's unresponsive.
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT
          
          The hearse executes a wide U-turn before gently rejoining
          the highway and heading back towards town. A moment after
          completing the turn, the one remaining headlight stutters
          and goes out. Bernice pulls off the road.
          
          INT. HEARSE. NIGHT
          
                                LARRY
                    Shit.
          He flicks the headlight switch, but to no avail. Then, in
          the distance, he sees a car approaching. Stanley can be
          glimpsed in the driving seat as the car flashes past.
          
                               LARRY (CONT'D)
                    Shit.   Shitshitshit.
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT
          
          Bernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the
          darkness after Stanley.
          
          INT. HEARSE. NIGHT
          
          Phil is motionless, and Larry peers out into the darkness
          as the car limps on, lit only from the light of the moon.
          Larry sees a glow in the distance ahead, and drives towards
          a neon sign; 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
          
                                                               82.
          CON TINUE D:
          He stops by the entrance to the inn and stares at Stanley's
          car parked in the bay outside room 8. He glances across at
          Phil, turns the car around and drives in.
          
          EXT. JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT
          
          Bernice glides to a stop in the bay next to Stanley's car.
          Larry gets out and looks around. After a moment, he walks
          over to the door of room eight and knocks.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8 - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT
          
          A tired-looking Stanley opens the door.
          
                                     STANLEY
                         Yeah?
                                     LARRY
                         Hi.
          
                                     STANLEY
                         Hello.
          
          They stare at each other.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Um. I'm one of the guys that
                         took your son.
          
          After a moment, Stanley steps back and opens the door.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         You'd better come in.
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR PARK - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT
          A car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids
          across the road. It reverses and pulls in, parking next to
          the hearse. Barbara and Susie get out and look around.
          Then Susie walks over to the hearse's passenger window and
          raps on the glass, and Barbara marches to the back of the
          hearse and attempts to open it. She can't.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         Where's the catch on this piece
                         of shit?
          
          Susie notices Phil, slumped in the seat.
          
                                     SUSIE
                         Phil?    Phil!
          
                                                               83.
          
          
          
          INT. HEARSE - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT
          
          Phil comes to. He looks out of the window at Susie, then
          at the 'Joshua Tree' sign, then at the door to room eight,
          then round to the back of the shaking hearse as Barbara
          tries to get the door open. His jaw drops open and he rubs
          his eyes again, before getting out of the car.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8 - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT
          
          Phil stands in front of Susie.
          
                              SUSIE
                    What happened to your head?
          
          He touches his head and looks at the blood on his fingers.
          His handcuff hangs from his wrist and Susie stares at it.
          
                              PHIL
                    A hippie hit it.   I thought you'd
                    gone.
          
                              SUSIE
                    Hold that thought.
          
                              PHIL
                    What the hell does that mean?
          
                              SUSIE
                    I need to know what it is you're
                    doing.
          
          Barbara shouts from the back of the car.
          
                              BARBARA
                    I told you what he's doing! He's
                    going to set fire to my Gram in
                    some freaky ceremony with witches
                    and black magic and... dolls.
          
                              PHIL
                    Dolls?
          
                              SUSIE
                    Dolls to stick pins in.
          
                              PHIL
                    What the hell are you talking
                    about?
          
                              BARBARA
                        (shouts)
                    I want my man back!
          
                              PHIL
                    Enough of this shit.
          
                                                                       84.
          CON TINUE D:
          
          Phil walks over to the door of room 8.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         They've gotta be in here.    It's
                         fate.
          
          He opens the door and walks in.
          
          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
          
          Larry and Stanley are sitting on the bed.          Phil shoots a
          vicious look at Larry.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Whatever happened to peace, love
                         and understanding, hippie?
                                   STANLEY
                         You're Kaufman?
          
                                   PHIL
                         Yup.
          
          Stanley folds his arms.         Susie and Barbara follow Phil into
          the room.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         And you are?
          
                                   SUSIE
                         I'm with him.
          
          She indicates Phil.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         Hello Stanley. Remember me?     The
                         psychotic girlfriend?
          
                                   STANLEY
                         Hello Barbara. Nothing wrong
                         with your memory.
          
          He turns to Phil.
          
                                   STANLEY (CONT'D)
                         Did you sell tickets or
                         something? Now, you boys want to
                         tell me why you stole my son?
          
                                   LARRY
                         Well, I didn't even know he was
                         in the box.
          
                                                                85.

                         I'm going to cremate him, here in
                         the desert where he felt most at
                         home. That's what he wanted.

                         The hell you are, Kaufman.
          
          Stanley picks up the phone and starts to dial.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         You know I can't let you do that?

                         I know you have to.
          Stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table.   Everyone
          jumps.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         I don't have to do anything,
                         Mister Kaufman. This is MY loss!
                         This was MY son! How dare you
                         try to take my grief away from
                         me.

                         It's too late to claim him now.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         What the hell does that mean?
          
          They are almost nose-to-nose now.
          
                                   PHIL
                         It means that you were never
                         there when it mattered to Gram.
                         It means that you stopped being a
                         father the moment he stopped
                         doing your bidding. It means
                         that you learned to care too
                         late. That's what it means.

          Stanley sits down.

                         It's true that when Gram left
                         college, we drifted apart.

                     He was a disappointment to me,
                     because he wouldn't use his
                     brain. He had so much to offer,
                     but he let it trickle away.

                     No - he gave it his all, but in a
                     way you could never understand.
                     And all he ever wanted from you
                     was approval. He wanted you to

          Stanley looks up at Phil.
          
                               STANLEY
                     I understand that you were his
                     right-hand man, as well as his
                     friend?
          
                               PHIL
                     I was both, yes.
                               STANLEY
                     And that you weren't there when
                     he died? When he needed you
                     most?
          
          A beat, then:
          
                                 PHIL
                     Yes.    That's right.
          
                               STANLEY
                     So the guilt isn't all mine,
                     then?
          
                               PHIL
                     I guess not.
          
          Susie walks over and takes Phil's hand. Stanley says
          nothing for a moment, but his eyes fill with tears.
          
                                                               87.
          CON TINUE D: (3)
          
                               STANLEY
                     You boys took away my son. I
                     lost him once in life, and now
                     you're trying to take him from me
                     again.
          
          He starts to cry. Larry shoots an imploring look at Phil.
          Barbara glances around the room.
          
                               BARBARA
                     Can we just cut through this?
          
          She gestures at Phil and Larry.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                     You two stole the body. Theft.
          Indicates Susie.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                     Sweetie, I'm sorry, but you seem
                     to be in the whole thing up to
                     your neck. Accessory.
          
          Waves a hand at Stanley.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                     And you are an old fool who
                     should have called the police,
                     but hasn't. Stupidity.
          
          She walks over to the phone.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                     Now, let's just call the cops and
                     get it done. The sooner we get
                     us a death certificate and bury
                     him, the sooner his soul will be
                     properly laid to rest.
          
          Phil walks over to Barbara, picks her up and carries her
          into the bathroom.
          
                              BARBARA (CONT'D)
                     Hey! What the hell are you
                     doing?
          
          He emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle,
          effectively locking the door.
          
                               STANLEY
                     Son, you had your chance to look
                     after Gram, and now he's dead.
          
          There is a 'bang' from the bathroom, and the door shakes.
          
                                                                88.

                     Bastard!
          
                               PHIL
                     I only failed because I couldn't
                     save him from himself. You
                     failed him all his life. You
                     never believed. I never doubted.
          
          Stanley pauses.
          
                               STANLEY
                     Okay. You tell me why I should
                     let you take my boy.
                               PHIL
                     I was his road manager and his
                     friend. We loved it out here in
                     the desert, and we made a pact
                     that whoever died first, the
                     other would come down here and
                     set them free. Gram gave his
                     word and I gave mine.
          
          Stanley thinks about this.
          
                               STANLEY
                     You're a couple of druggies.   Why
                     should I believe you?
          
          Phil doesn't like the inference.
          
                               PHIL
                     I don't take drugs.
          Another 'bang' from the bathroom.   Stanley turns to Larry.
          
                               STANLEY
                     What about you? Are you a
                     druggie?
          
          There is a long pause.    Then:
          
                                 LARRY
                     Yes.    Yes I am.
          
          Phil closes his eyes. Stanley picks up the receiver and
          starts to dial. Then Phil jumps up off the bed and walks
          out of the room. After a moment, Larry and Susie follow.
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8 - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT
          
          Phil is waiting by the car.
          
                                                                      89.

                         Nice work. Let's go.
          
          Larry gives Phil the screwdriver.
          
                                   LARRY
                         I can't do this.      This isn't
                         right.
          
          Larry walks away leaving Phil with Susie.         He looks at her.
          
                                   SUSIE
                         Just do whatever feels right to
                         you.
                                     PHIL
                         God damn!
          
          After a moment, Phil walks back into room eight.
          
          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
          
          Stanley is sitting on the bed, the receiver in his hand.
          Phil sits facing him.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Did you call them?
          
                                     STANLEY
                         No.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Are you going to call them?
                                   STANLEY
                         Well, you haven't given me a
                         reason not to.
          
          There is another 'crash' from inside the bathroom.        The
          door shakes.
          
                                   PHIL
                         There isn't a reason. If someone
                         tried to steal my son's body, I'd
                         stop them. For sure.
          
          Larry and Susie quietly enter the room.
          
                                   STANLEY
                         So you are prepared to go to
                         jail?
          
                                   PHIL

                                   STANLEY
                         What is it, son?
          
                                   LARRY
                         I've been a junkie for over four
                         years. I started taking heroin
                         on June 5th 1969 at a concert in
                         Indiana. I...
          
                                   STANLEY
                         You don't need...
          
          Larry holds his hand up to stop Stanley.
          
                                   LARRY
                         I've taken heroin, speed, uppers,
                         downers, blues, morphine,
                         methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes,
                         acid, valium, barbiturates,
                         straight LSD, marijuana,
                         marijuana laced with opium,
                         nembutal, mescalin of course, and
                         medical methaqualone, which made
                         me shake uncontrollably for six
                         weeks and vomit every hour.
                                   STANLEY
                             (dryly)
                         That's very impressive, son.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Not my point.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Better make the point.
          
                                    LARRY
                         I started working my way through
                         that list on June 5th 1969, and
                         since then there hasn't been a
                         day when I didn't at least smoke
                         one joint.
          
          Phil shoots Larry a dangerous look.
          
                                                                  91.

                               PHIL
                     Are we sure that this is helping?
          
          Larry ignores him.
          
                               LARRY
                     And now I've stopped. I stopped
                     because it seems that I had
                     something more important to do.
          
          They all look at him.   He gestures at Phil.
          
                               LARRY (CONT'D)
                     He's doing this because he gave
                     his word. I'm prepared to do
                     this now because I think it's
                     right. And because I believe
                     that each body has a soul. And
                     Gram's soul doesn't belong in a
                     family plot surrounded by
                     strangers. It belongs here,
                     where he was happiest.
          
          In the silence, Susie walks over and grips Phil's hand.
          Then Stanley gets up off the bed.
          
                               STANLEY
                     I'm going to go say goodbye to my
                     son.
          
          Everyone looks surprised. Phil gives Larry a look of
          appreciative approval. Barbara starts to kick furiously at
          the door from inside the bathroom. Stanley pauses for a
          moment, and then walks outside. Phil and Larry watch him
          go, and Susie walks over to kiss Phil.
                               PHIL
                     What's that for?
          
                               SUSIE
                     That's for failing to reinforce
                     my expectations.
          
                               PHIL
                     Well... I'll have to do that more
                     often.
          
          The three of them move to the door, and Phil turns to
          Larry.
          
                               PHIL (CONT'D)
                     Did you really take all those
                     drugs?
          
                               LARRY
                     Of course not.

                               LARRY (CONT'D)
                     I may have got a little carried
                     away...
          
          The door of the bathroom shakes and one of the hinges flies
          across the room.
          
                               PHIL
                     C'mon, time to go...
          
          EXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8. NIGHT
          
          Phil, Larry and Susie leave room eight. They look around
          with surprise, but there is no sign of Stanley. Phil opens
          the back of the hearse and takes a quick peek inside the
          casket.
          
                               PHIL
                     Just checking.
          
                               LARRY
                     Yeah, he took the body and
                     stuffed it in the trunk of his
                     car before escaping into the
                     night.
          
          Larry is already behind the wheel.   Phil opens the car door
          and looks at Susie.
          
                               PHIL
                     Are you coming?
          
          She smiles at him.
                               SUSIE
                     I reckon I am.
          
          She gets in. There is a final, almighty 'crash' from
          inside room eight. The three of them look at each other,
          and then Bernice is gone into the darkness. A moment later
          Barbara runs outside. She leaps into her car and screeches
          after them. In the distance a blue flashing police light
          suddenly materializes.
          
          INT. BARBARA'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          Barbara is on the road, driving fast. Suddenly a blue
          flashing police light fills her mirror.
          
                                  BARBARA
                     Thank God!
          
          She pulls over and the police cruiser pulls in behind her.
          The traffic cop walks up and looks through the window.
          
                                                               93.

          Barbara gives it everything.
          
                                   BARBARA
                         Please help me, they've got my
                         boyfriend's corpse and they're
                         going to perform a ritual with
                         his body.
          
          The cop turns on his torch and peers at her carefully.
          
                                   TRAFFIC COP

                         I've just told you that they've
                         stolen a body and you want to see
                         my driving license?
          
          He just stares at her.      Barbara is losing it.
          
                                   BARBARA (CONT'D)
                         You people are supposed to be on
                         the lookout for a hearse. A
                         hearse is a big long car. You
                         can usually tell which ones are
                         the hearses, because they have
                         coffins in the back. The one
                         we're looking for is painted
                         yellow. Does this look like a
                         yellow hearse to you, asshole?
          
          Long pause. Barbara realizes that she might have gone too
          far. He starts to write a ticket.
          
                                   BARBARA (CONT'D)
                         Is that a ticket? Are you
                         writing me a ticket?

          INT. HEARSE. NIGHT
          
          Phil indicates an area just off the road.
          
                                                                   94.

                         Really peaceful...
          
          Larry pulls the hearse over near the rock. They all sit
          there for a moment. Phil and Larry look at each other.
          
          EXT. DESERT. NIGHT
          
          Phil opens the back of the hearse and slides the casket out
          of the car. He notices that Larry has made no move to
          help. Susie sits on a rock and watches.
          
                                   PHIL
                         You wanna give me a hand here?
          Larry walks over and grabs the other end of the casket.
          They walk it away from the car and lay it down. As they
          lower it, the coffin slips out of Phil's hands and bangs
          down in the sand.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Sorry, Gram.
          
          They stand and stare at the casket.      Susie walks over with
          the guitar and takes Phil's hand.
          
                                     LARRY
                         What now?

                         Now we... do it.
          
          He gets the gasoline can from the car and stands over the
          casket.
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Take the top off.
          
                                     LARRY
                         Why?
          
                                   PHIL
                         Flesh burns easier than wood.
          
                                   LARRY
                         I can't believe you just said
                         that. I'm not taking the top
                         off.
          
          He walks off. Phil puts the can down and removes the top
          of the casket. He peers inside.
          
                                                                    95.

                                   PHIL
                         Right.
          
          He pours some gasoline into the casket.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         Do you think that's enough?
          Against his better judgment, Larry walks over and peers
          inside.
          
                                   LARRY
                         Well, I don't know.   Maybe a
                         little more.
          
          Phil pours a little more fuel in.       He looks over at Susie.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Enough?

                         I'm not having a conversation
                         with you about how much gasoline
                         you need to burn a body.
          
          She backs off.
                                   LARRY
                         I think that'll do it.
          
          Phil stops pouring and shakes the can.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Only a little left.
          
          He pours the rest of the can into the casket. Susie walks
          over to stand next to Phil. He looks down at Gram.
          
                                   PHIL (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry I wasn't there for you
                         when it mattered, but I was there
                         before, and I've been there ever
                         since. Gram, good luck to you,
                         wherever you are.
          
          They all stare at the casket. Phil wipes a tear away and
          tucks a can of beer into the coffin.
          
                                                               96.

          He rests Gram's guitar against the casket, takes big puffs
          on his cigar to get the flame up, then tosses it into the
          coffin. They wait. Nothing happens. Phil edges nearer
          and looks inside. Then the coffin explodes into flames.
          All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast.

          Phil, Larry and Susie pick themselves up. They stare at
          the pyre. Phil is close to tears, and Susie puts her arm
          around him. For a moment, Phil thinks he sees the flames
          morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin.
          The image disappears when Larry speaks.
          
                               LARRY
                     Maybe too much fuel.

                     Nah, I just didn't factor in the
                     booze inside of him. Gram

          He breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the
          darkness, followed by a siren.

          Larry and Susie run to the car. Phil lingers a moment,
          looking down at the flames. Then he follows the others.

                         If you want to catch someone in
                         the dark, it's best not to turn
                         on big flashing lights and make a

          The traffic cop stares into the fire.

          Phil is fast asleep and snoring in Bernice's passenger
          seat. He wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright
          sunshine that pours through the windscreen. He pulls a
          flask out of the glove compartment and takes a long gargle,
          spitting the result out of the window.
          
                                                               98.

          Then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man
          sitting in the casket bay.
          
                                   GRAM
                         Sure is hot.
          
                                   PHIL

                         Phil.
          
          Gram pulls himself along the bay and onto the back seat.
          He then climbs into the front, settles next to Phil and
          holds his hand out for the flask.
          
                                   PHIL
                         Do you think you should?

                         Not gonna hurt me now, is it?
          
          He takes a drink and looks around.
          
                                   GRAM (CONT'D)
                         Nice wheels. Very stylish.
          
                                   PHIL
                         They're very handy for
                         transporting dead people around.
                         Nothing better.
          
                                   GRAM
                         I am dead, then?
          
                                   PHIL
                         You're more than dead, Gram. You
                         and the box are down to bones and

                         eye.
          
          He takes another drink and hands the flask back to Phil.
          
                                   PHIL

                         I just burned you to a cinder,

          And Gram is now Larry, peering down at Phil.

          Phil sits bolt upright and looks around the car.   Larry and
          Susie stare back at him.
          
                               PHIL
                     Doesn't matter. Can we go now?
                     I'm getting sick of sand.
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY
          
          We hear Gram's: 'Return Of The Grievous Angel' or some
          similar music.
          
          We follow Bernice as she drives through the desert, and
          into Los Angeles. We follow her through the city streets,
          and we stay with her as she parks.
          Fade down music.
          
          INT. HEARSE. DAY
          
          Phil turns off the ignition and sits back in his seat.   He
          and Larry look at each other.
          
                               LARRY
                     Well, we did it.    We saved a
                     soul.
          
          He leans across to hug Phil, who looks awkward and pats him
          on the shoulder instead.
          
                               PHIL
                     Singed my damn mustache, that's
                     for sure.
          
          Phil pulls a cigar out of his pocket and lights it. The
          handcuff dangles from his wrist and bangs against the dash.
          He stares at the match as it burns.
          
                               LARRY
                     Well, shall we?
          
          Phil blows the match out.

          There is a small moment of tension, before Phil grins at
          her. They kiss.
          
                                   SUSIE
                         Get out of here.   Finish it.
          
          Phil pats Bernice's battered wing as he walks away and over
          to where Larry is waiting. They cross the road and walk
          into a building through heavy wooden doors. Pull back to
          reveal a sign: 'Los Angeles Police Department'.

          appeared in West L.A. Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 -
          Gram Parsons's 27th birthday. Since a corpse has no
          intrinsic value, the two were charged with misdemeanor
          theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment:
          $708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for each of
          the bodysnatchers.

          HONG KONG - AN OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE
          Crowded. Filled with oriental and British merchants.
          You can buy anything here. Electronics. Food. Any-
          thing.

          RAND PELTZER
          walks through the owd. An American businessman.1-He
          wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished
          good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old.
          Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people
          and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL,
          WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite
          smile.

          RAND
          Hi. I'm from out of town...
          on business from the U.S.
          The woman nods and smiles.

          AN ORIENTAL MAN
          passes by. He is very old. Deep wrinkles. Long white
          hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing
          Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop.

          RAND
          (explaining to
          Oriental woman)
          I'm looking for a present...
          for my son.
          The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She
          holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head.

          RAND
          He's not really involved in
          sports...
          The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony
          "Walkman". Rand again shakes his head.,

          RAND
          No. I want something unusual...
          something he can't get at home...
          something different..

          
          

          .2.

          A HAND
          reaches out and grabs Rand's arm. Startled, he turns.
          The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's
          eyes.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I can help you.
          He leads Rand away from the booth.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I offer something very different.
          Very unusual.
          Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Follow me.
          He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow. Rand
          pauses, skeptical.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Come. Take a look. It will cost
          you nothing.
          (a beat)
          You won't be disappointed.
          The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and follows.

          INSIDE
          Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs.
          At the top, they enter a room.

          INT. ROOM

          Dark. No windows. No furniture. Filled with cardboard
          boxes and wooden crates.
          Rand crinkles his nose. It su,Qlls bad in here.
          The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb. He leads the
          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.
          The Oriental picks up a small, metal box. A HIGH PITCHED
          GIGGLE echoes from inside the box.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          Rand is very puzzled.
          The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens
          the box.
          A TINY CREATURE is inside'.
          The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on
          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered
          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The
          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.
          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,
          square teeth.
          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.
          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything
          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney
          character.
          The Oriental claps his hands.
          The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder.
          The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the
          creature.
          The Oriental claps his hands again.
          The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand
          with those cute green eyes'.

          RAND
          (to the Oriental)
          What is it?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It is called ' Mogwai ' .
          (a beat)
          A very rare and intelligent animal.
          I found it in the fields near my
          home It will obey all orders.
          It learns fast.
          The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands.

          --Mogwai leaps to the ground. It scurries across the floor,
          to a wooden crate.
          Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate. It tears off a
          chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man..
          He takes the fish. Mogwai hops back into the box.
          Rand shakes his head. Amazed by the animal.
          he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs
          own his chin. He smiles at Rand.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          And if you are ever in need of
          a song...
          He claps his hands to the creature.

          ORIENTAL MAN.
          (Chinese; English

          SUBTITLES)
          Music.
          Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It's
          beautiful.
          Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.

          RAND -
          How much?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          One hundred American Dollars.
          Cash.
          Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives
          them to the man.
          The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps
          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute
          giggle.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It never sleeps. It will eat any-
          thing... but prefers raw meat.

          (PAUSE)
          It must always be kept indoors during
          the day. It lives in shadow. It
          hates bright light. Direct sunlight
          will kill it.
          Rand nods. He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it
          into the box. Rand puts the box under his arm. The
          Oriental smiles

          

          

          

          

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Your son will enjoy his new friend.
          Rand smiles and exits. The Oriental takes a bite from
          his raw fish.

          CUT TO:..

          Rand is on the pay telephon His baggage rests beside
          him.
          Mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box. The creature's
          bright eyes shine from inside.

          RAND

          Billy is 26 years old. His sturdy build and good looks are
          buried beneath wire rimmed glasses, slicked dirty-blonde
          .hair, a red sweater vest, a loose fitting checkered shirt,
          baggy corduroys and worn loafers.
          râ¢ Finishing the transaction with his customer, Billy looks to

          BILLY
          Next.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          an elderly woman, walks to Billy's window. She's a real
          prude. Tight lips. Heavy make-up. Bleached hair. Cheap
          fur coat. She hands Billy a personal check.

          TRACY ALLEN
          another teller, works beside Billy. Tracy is pretty. Big
          brown eyes. A sexy smile. Long dark hair. Perfect figure.
          25 years old.
          Tracy counts out some cash to a customer. She's trying
          to concentrate, to keep her mind on work.. But it's diffi-
          cult when

          GARY LUCIA
          the bank security guard, is trying to make her laugh. He
          stands by the bank entrance, making funny faces at Tracy.
          Gary is 30 years old. Former high school jock. Dark,
           thick hair. Deep brown eyes. Muscular. A strong, handsome
          face.
          Meanwhile, Billy gives the check back to Mrs. Deagle.

          BILLY
          I can't cash this, M'am. Your
          last check hasn't cleared.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't you recognize me?

          BILLY
          No, M'am. I'm sorry...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          That's the problem with this world.

          clear, M'am,

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't get smart with me, oung man.

          BILLY
          I wasn't getting smart, I was...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          (shouting,-looking

          AROUND)
          Where's the president? I want to
          see the bank president!
          Billy rubs his eyes. Tense. Embarrassed.
          Everyone watches the scene. Tracy. Gary. The customers.

          ROLAND FRESCO
          the bank's Vice President, walks over to Billy and Mrs.
          beagle. Roland is tall, slender with thin grey hair and
          a pencil thin moustache. Friendliness and courtesy are
          his job. He smiles at Mrs. Deagle.

          ROLAND
          What seems to be the problem,
          M'am?

          MRS. DEAGLE
          My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This
          young teller is being very rude! I
          demand that you fire him!

          Roland looks at Billy. Billy rolls his eyes. Roland
          smiles.

          ROLAND

          (COMFORTING)
          Now,-Mrs. Deagle...I'm sure this
          isn't that serious. I'm sure an
          apology would fix things right
          up. Wouldn't it?
          The woman shrugs.' Roland turns to Billy.

          ROLAND
          Apologize to the woman, Billy.
          Billy leans to Roland.

          BILLY

          Just apologize.
          Roland.leans back and smiles at Mrs. Deagle.
          Billy looks at her. He doesn'-t want to do this.
          Everyone in the bank is watching him, waiting for him
          to take a stand.
          Billy sighs. He needs his job.

          BILLÂ°
          (forcing himself)
          I'm sorry, Mrs. Deagle.
          She nods and smiles. Roland puts his hand on the woman's
          shoulder.

          ROLAND
          Come back to my desk, Mrs. Deagle.
          I'll personally take care of your
          banking problems.
          Roland walks back to his office with Mrs. Deagle.
          Gary chuckles. Tracy goes back to work.
          Billy just sits. Angry. Humiliated. He calls the next
          customer.

          TRACY
          stands in the lobby, putting on.her coat. Billy moves to
          help her.

          BILLY

          He helps her on with the coat.

          Gary walks up. He puts his arm through Tracy's.

          What's this?

          BILLY
          It's a book. You read 1t.
          Billy exchanges a smile with Tracy. Gary isn't amused.

          C'mon. Let's go.
          Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away.
          Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side.
          He lifts the sword and lunges forward. At Gary.
          Billy sits at a table. Alone. He's reading his book. He
          eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He's fas-
          cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny
          section.. He laughs.

          PETE FOUNTANE
          walking home from school. Pete is 16 years old. A chunky,
           pleasant baby faced kid. With his bright orange down jacket,

          Pete...You okay?
          Pete nods. Billy helps him up. Pete brushes himself off.
          Billy is amused by the boy.

          BILLY
          You want a ride home?

          PETE

          Billy digs into his pocket and gives Pete the copy of
          "Once And Future King".

          BILLY

          Pete takes the book.

          PETE

          DORRY DOUGAL
          the 64 year old storekeeper, stands behind the counter.
          Dorry is husky, bald on top, with thick patches of red hair
          on his temples. A huge, red moustache sits beneath his
          bulbous nose. His arms are thick, hairy. A strong Irish-
          man.

          DORRY
          Good afternoon to you, Billy.

          BILLY
          Hi, Dorry.
          (eyes light)
          Is it ready yet?
          Dorry smiles. He reaches to a shelf behind the counter.
          He removes ,a long object, wrapped in a piece of green cloth.
          He rests it on the counter.

          Billy watches with.wide eyes. Pete is curious.
          Dorry slowly unwraps the object. Inside the cloth, is a
          long silver sword, with a gleaming blade and an engraved
          steel.holster.. - Pete is impressed..

          DORRY
          (to Pete)
          It's an authentic replica of an
          Eleventh Century sword.
          Billy's eyes examine every inch of the sword. It's
          beautiful.

          DORRY
          I got most of the rust off...But
          there were a couple spots that
          wouldn't budge.
          Billy runs his finger along the blade.

          DORRY
          Careful. It's sharp.
          A big smile covers Billy's face.- He's in love with the
          sword.

          BILLY
          What do I owe you?

          DORRY
          Two hundred. You can pay me twenty
          a week.
          Billy pulls a twenty from his wallet and pays Dorry.
          Billy carefully wraps the sword and puts it under his
          arm.

          BILLY
          Thanks, Dorry.

          DORRY

          Billy enters. He rests the sword on his bed. He unwraps
          it. He picks up the sword.
          He turns to the mirror and poses with the sword. He holds
          it at a few differentangles, trying to decide which looks
          best for him.
          He takes a few swings with the sword.
          He stops and smiles to himself. A real warrior.

          CUT TO:

          DINING ROOM
          Billy sits at the table, eating dinner with Lynn.

          LYNN
          How was work?

          BILLY
          Okay.

          LYNN
          Have you asked that Tracy girl
          out yet?

          

          

          

          

          18.

          LYNN
          I was just curious.

          BILLY
          Yeah,.well it's none of your
          business.
          Nervous,Lynn popsvalfum with her wine.

          .{ LYNN

          (OFFENDED)
          I guess it's none of my business
          that your clothes are washed and
          ironed, or that you have a hot
          meal on the table...

          BILLY
          No. It isn't. I'm old enough
          to take care of that stuff myself.
          I'm old enough to get a place of
          my own.

          LYNN
          Don't start that again. Your
          Father's coming home tonight.

          BILLY
          Good. I think we should talk
          about it.

          LYNN
          It'll put him in a bad mood.

          BILLY
          No, it'll put you in a bad mood.
          Lynn and Billy exchange a glare. They look down at their
          food.
          A few silent, uncomfortable moments pass.
          Lynn looks back to Billy. She smiles. Time for the
          tender approach. She touches his hand.

          LYNN
          Billy, honey...

          BILLY
          (moves his hand
          from hers)
          Stop calling me 'honey'.

          

          

          

          

          19.
          She smiles and tries again.

          LYNN
          Dad and I just don't want you to
          have to struggle like we did.
          We want to help, until you can
          support yourself as a writer.

          BILLY
          Bit it's gonna take me another-
          year to finish my novel. . .and what
          if it doesn't get published?

          LYNN
          It'll get published.

          BILLY
          But what if it doesn't? Are you
          gonna take care of me until I'm
          old and grey, working on my 25th
          unpublished novel?...

          LYNN
          If it takes that long, yes.

          BILLY

          (FRUSTRATED)
          Don't you understand?.. .I've got
          to 'leave now! I rve got to try and
          make it on my own now!
          Before Lynn.can reply, A VOICE INTERRUPTS.

          RAND (O . S . )
          Is anybody home?
          Lynn stands and whispers to Billy.

          LYNN
          Please, let's forget about this.
          Just for tonight. Okay?
          Billy pauses. Finally gives in and nods.
          Lynn stands. She pops another valium and exits to greet
          her husband. We hear them, exchange an excited ".hello".
          They kiss and laugh, glad to be in each other's arms.
          Billy just sits. Burning.

          INT. FRONT HALLWAY

          Rand hugs his wife. Barney is jumping up and down, tugging
          at Rand's coat.
          Suitcases rest on the floor.' Beside them, is, Mogwai's
          plastic case.
          Billy enters. Rand sees him.

          RAND

          (SMILES)
          Billy .. ,
          Billy walks to his Father. They embrace.

          BILLY
          (happy to see him)
          Hi, Dad.
          They hold each other for a second. Lynn closes the front
          door. Rand picks up Mogwai's case. Lynn turn's to her
          husband.

          RAND
          (takes Lynn's hand)
          Not now. I've got a surprise for
          both of you. Come on.
          He leads them into the living room. Lynn and. Billy exchange
          a puzzled glance. They follow Rand.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Rand dims the lights. He motions for Billy and Lynn to
          sit on the sofa. They do. Barney sits on Billy's lap.
          Rand sits in front of them, on a leather easy chair. He
          rests Mogwai's case on his lap. He opens the case.
          Mogwai leaps out, onto the coffee table.
          Lynn and'Bill are startled. They stare at the creature in
          wonderment.
          Barney hates it. He growls at Mogwai.

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Rand lights a cigarette. He turns to Mogwai and claps
          his hands. The creature picks up an ash tray and carries
          it to Rand. Mogwai hops onto Rand's lap.
          Lynn and Billy are amazed...

          BILLY
          (staring at Mogwai)
          What is it? A.monkey? A rat?.

          RAND
          Your new pet.

          BILLY

          (UNCERTAIN)
          Mj Oh, yeah?...
          Mogwai starts to sing, humming in that unearthly falsetto.

          BILLY
          What's that?

          RAND
          He's singing.

          BILLY
          Sounds kind of creepy.
          Barney still growls.

          RAND
          Barney! Be a good dog and go up-
          stairs!
          Barney reluctantly hops off Billy's lap and exits.
          Lynn stares at Mogwai.

          LYNN
          I think he's just darling.
          Mogwai.
          Rand holds the creature out to Billy.

          

          

          

          

          22

          RAND
          Hold him.

          BILLY
          (inching back)
          Maybe later.

          RAND
          C'mon. He won't bite.
          Billy forces himself to take the creature. Mogwai nestles
          close to Billy. Rand smiles at his son.

          RAND
          He likes you.
          Billy looks nauseous. Lynn stands.

          LYNN
          You two look so cute together.
          I have to take a picture.
          Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a
          Kodak Instamatic.
          Mogwai is on Billy's shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy
          hates it.

          RAND -
          I want you to take good care
          of him.
          Lynn focuses the camera on Billy and Mogwai.

          LYNN
          Okay smile.
          Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still licks his cheek.
          Lynn snaps the picture. Flash!
          Mogwai lets out a high scream. Frightened of the bright
          light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally scratching Billy's
          cheek.

          BILLY
          Little bastard.
          Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature,
          comforting it

          

          

          

          

          11 23.
          Settle down, Billy-There's no
          reason to get upset. The little
          fellow's scared. He hates bright
          light..
          Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on
          his face. He looks -at t em.
          There's blood on hisï¿½4ingertips.
          Billy looks at Mogwai.
          The creature looks at Billy. It giggles.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BILLY'S ROOM - LATER

          Billy sits at his desk, working on his novel. His typing
          is fast, intense. A small desk lamp lights.his working
          area.
          Mogwai watches Billy. from the darkness of the book shelves.
          Above Billy., The creature begins to sing.
          Billy tries to ignore Mogwai's singing. No good. It gets
          on his nerves. Billy slams his hand on the desk top. He
          glares at the creature.

          BILLY
          Shut up.
          Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing.
          Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct
          light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles
          up to Billy's arm. He jumps back.

          BILLY
          Get off of me.
          Mogwai just looks at him.

          BILLY
          Get.off`my desk.
          Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's
          eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor.
          Billy looks down at the creature.

          BILLY
          Stay down there.
          Billy goes back to his work.
          Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It
          sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's
          too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the
          floor.
          Billy turns.
          Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened.
          Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.

          BILLY
          (angry, to Mogwai)
          You stupid little...
          Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill
          the tiny creature.
          Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It
          is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery.
          Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and
          picks up the.creature.

          BILLY

          (TENDER)
          I'm sorry.. .just try to be more
          careful.
          Billy holds Mogwai to his chest. He's petting it, com-
          forting it.

          get so carried away. It's only a
          dream.

          BILLY
          Hey...Don't give up on your dreams.
          They just might come true.
          Tracy shrugs and takes a sip of coffee.

          BILLY
          Can I ask you a personal question?
          (Tracy nods)
          What is it with you and Gary? Is
          he your boyfriend?

          TRACY
          He thinks he is.

          BILLY
          Do you think he is?

          TRACY
          No. I think of him more as a friend.
          But he thinks of me as a lot more.

          BILLY
          So there's a possibility...I mean...
          I.just might have a chance with you?

          Mggwai's case sits on the ed. The creature is inside.
          Billy finishes his watering. He sits at his desk. He
          takes adrink from glass of milk and snacks from a plate
          of brownies. He proofreads some pages from his novel.

          PETE (O.S.)
          Hello? Is anybody home?

          BILLY

          (SHOUTS)
          n here, Pete.
          Billy holds the tray of brownies to him.

          BILLY
          Want some?

          PETE _
          I'm s'posed to be on a diet...
          He grabs a brownie. He notices Mogwai's case.

          PETE
          What's in there?
          Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto
          the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is, taken aback.

          PETE
          What is it?

          BILLY
          A present from my Dad.
          Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.

          PETE
          It's neat.
          Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops
          from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie
          and starts to eat.

          PETE
          Hey, Billy.. .You think I might
          be able to borrow it? Just for
          a night?

          BILLY
          I dunno, Pete...

          PETE
          C'mon...My Mom will never know.
          I'll hide it under my bed.
          Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily
          knocks over the water bottle.
          A few drops of water splash Mogwai.
          The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched
          scream.
          Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared.
          Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with
          water begin to bubble... .expand...'
          Billy can't believe his eyes.
          Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more,
          getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode.
          Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated.
          The spots burst.

          FOUR NEW CREATURES
          popout. Clones of Mogwai.
          The spots on Mogwai's body bond together and disappear, as
          if they were never there.
          There are now five identical creatures on the desktop.
          Billy and Pete share a shocked glance.
          Billy grabs the water bottle. He has to be certain that
          he wasn't halucinating. He splashes a little more water
          on one of the new creatures.
          The process begins again. The creature's body,contorts.
          A few lumps form. The lumps expand until...they burst.

          Billy tries to make sense out of it all.
          EIGHT CREATURES stand on.the desk top, examining their
          new world.
          Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk
          on one of the crealtures.
          Nothing happens.

          BILLY
          They must only multiply with plain

          BILLY
          (still dazed)
          Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so.
          Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group.
          It cries out. In a high, piercing scream.
          The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature
          and bring it back to their group.

          PETE

          (SCARED)
          Maybe I won't take one.
          The creatures have moved to the brownies. They rip the

           Billy spots something. He nudges his Father.
           There are NINE INDIVIDUAL PODS, stuck to various places-on
          the floor. The pods are 16 inches long, 12 inches in dia-

          with a thick, syrupy glaze.

          Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head
          and swings down, hard. Against the pod.
          The bat snaps in two.
          The pod is unblemished.

          attic-are cocoons. Inside,. the
          creatures are going through some
          sort of change...a metamorphosis.

          BILLY
          Why did they attack my dog?

          ROY
          Simple. They're animals. They
          were hungry. Aside from water,
          food is their main concern.

          I get back from Seattle on

          struction people. They'll come
          in next week and cut these things
          out of the floor.

          BILLY
          I don't think we should wait. Let's
          do it ourselves.

          The cocoons are bubbling furiously; as if they were being
          baked in an oven.
          Suddenly, a crack appears on one. Then another. And
          another. Cracks begin to cover all the cocoons.
          Green smoke seeps from the thin openings. A slow soft
          hiss is heard.
          They're hatching.

          There, he lunges forward with his sword. Bullseye. Mogwai
          is stabbed. Straight through the chest.

          The three creatures hop to the floor and move towards

          BILLY:
          He clutches his sword. Tight.
          Two creatures leap at him.
          He spears one in mid-air.
          He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the
          ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists
          the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood.
          The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg.
          It takes a bite from his calf.
          Billy cries out in pair.
          Mogwai stays on. Biting hard.
          Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace.
          Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go.
          Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring
          flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to
          a crisp.
          Billy removes his steaming sword.
          The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead.
          Billy checks his leg. A small bite.

          The startled creature spins inside.. Mogwai's screams
          die as it is chopped into a green mush.
          The remaining creature growls at Billy.

          Mogwai leaps out of the way, onto the kitchen cabinet.
          Billy turns to the creature.
          Mogwai stands in front of the open microwave oven.

          sword, but Mogwai is clawing and biting at him.
          Billy's hand finally reaches the sword. He snatches it.
          He brings down the blade, into the creature's arm.
          Mogwai jumps back. Wounded.
          Billy stands. He raises his sword to finish off the creature.
          Mogwai dodges theblade, jumping to the window ledge.
          Billy moves toward the creature.
          Mogwai smashes through'the window, escaping into the night.

          into the darkness.
          Following the footprints, Billy runs after the creature.

          Peggy! Come inside! It's too
          dark! You'll ruin your eyes
          building the snowman!

          'Skippy The Snowman' will be

          Before Peggy can scream, Mogwai grabs her.
          The creature pulls Peggy inside the snowman.
          Peggy puts up afight. But she isn't strong enough. Her
          little feet kick as she is pulled inside of the snowman.

          BILLY(
          arrives in Peggy's backyard. He sees the young girl's
          legs kicking from the snowman's torso.
          Billy rushes over. He grabs Peggy's legs. A tug of war.
          Billy pulls Peggy out of the snowman.

          A monster came out of Skippy
          the Snowman.
          Billy quickly attacks the snowman with his sword.
          He swings and swings until "Skippy" is nothing but a pile
          of snow.
          But there is no sign of Mogwai.
          Billy spots footprints leading away from the snowman.
          Mogwai has escaped.
          Billy runs after the footprints.
          Peggy watches him disappear around the corner of the house.
          Peggy's Mother opens the door. She is puzzled by the pile of
          snow in front of Peggy.

          THEM
          He flips on the police siren and heads for town.

           CUT TO:

          THE SUBURBS
          Peaceful. Calm. Christmas lights twinkle.

          THE POLICE CAR
          suddenly squeals down the main road. Lights flashing.
          Siren blaring.

          BILLY
          steers the patrol car into the first driveway.
          The car screeches to a stop. Billy gets out. Sword in
          hand, he runs to the front door of the house. He
          knocks. Hard.

          MR. FUTTERS
          a balding, middle-aged man, wearing a bathrobe and pajamas,
          answers the door.

          MR. FUTTERS

          (PUZZLED)
          Billy Peltzer?...What's going on
          here?..

          

          

          

          

          70.

          BILLY

          (BREATHLESS)
          They're coming.

          MR. FUTTERS
          Huh?..

          BILLY
          (fast, hyper)
          You've got to keep your wind ws
          locked. Or better yet...boa d them
          up! And your lights... You've got
          to leave them on!
          f+ MR. FUTTERS
          What are you talking about, boy?

          BILLY
          There are these little things...
          animals...They're all over the
          place! They'll kill you and your
          family!...
          Mr. Futters starts to laugh.

          MR. FUTTERS
          Have you been drinking?

          BILLY
          No sir, I...

          MR. FUTTERS
          And what the hell is that? A
          sword?

          BILLY
          Yes...

          MR. FUTTERS
          And what are-you doing with the
          Sheriff's car? Are you on drugs?
          Billy starts to explain when

          MR. DEAGLE
          the next door neighbor, walks onto his porch.
          Deagle is a portly man, with curly grey hair and a beard.
          He calls to Mr. Futters

          

          

          

          

          71.

          MR. DEAGLE
          Hey, Joe...I saw the police car.
          You in some kind of trouble?

          MR. FUTTERS
          ,No, it's this Peltzer kid. He
          thinks we're gonna get: eaten up
          by wild animals. And he's
          carrying a sword.

          MR. DEAGLE
          Did you say 'Peltzer'? Billy
          Peltzer?

          MR. FUTTERS
          1 Yeah...

          MR. DEAGLE
          (shakes his head)
          He's a nut. Went crazy in the
          bank today. Called my wife all
          kinds of names.
          (to Billy)
          You smartass son of a bitch. If
          I was ten years younger I'd beat
          the crap out of you.
          Billy sighs, frustrated.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          joins her husband on the porch.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          What's the matter?...
          (she sees Billy)
          Oh, it's you. Here to
          apologize?

          MRS. DEAGLE

          I knew he was crazy from the
          start.
          (glares at Billy)
          I hope they lock you up for
          good, and throw away the key.
          Mr. Deagle puts his arm around his wife.

          MR. DEAGLE
          C'mon back inside, dear. Let's
          finish watching 'Dallas'.

          G'night, Joe.

          MR. FUTTERS
          Good night, Ed.
          (to Billy)
          You've got ten seconds to get
          the hell out of my yard. Then
          I'm.calling the Sheriff...if he
          isn't out looking for you already.
          He slams the door and goes inside.
          Billy just stands there. Defeated. Frustrated.

          A CREATURE
          hisses. Behind Billy.
          Billy turns. Mogwai leaps at him.
          Billy raises his sword and swings.
          He knocks the creature down. He stabs Mogwai.
          Mogwai dies with a long scream.
          Billy looks up and sees

          THE PACK OF CREATURES
          moving down Main Street. They have arrived. Looking for
          food.
          Many break into the house across the street. There are
          some human screams. Then the house lights go out.

          Several creatures come towards Billy.
          Billy runs to the police car. He opens the door and gets
          inside.
          A creature leaps at him.
          Billy slams the car door. It severs the creature4si-rand..
          Several creatures surround the car.
          Billy hears a familiar voice. Screaming. He looks out
          the window.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          comes running out of her house, towards the police car.
          f_ She-'s screaming for help.

          I
          A creature is on her back.
          Another creature leaps at her.
          She falls. Into the snow.
          Several creatures attack Mrs. Deagle. Her screams fade.
          So does her life.

          BILLY
          looks away. More creatures are. surrounding the car.
          They pound against the windows. They want in.
          A scared Billy flips on the police radio.

          Billy drops the radio mike.

          Billy thinks fast. He flips on the siren and flashing

          are scared of the bright lights. They scatter away from

          into the car and drive off.

          They are everywhere.
          On rooftops. Front lawns. Smashing through windows.
          Breaking into homes.
          Scattered human screams echo through the night.
          People are dying.
          Mogwai is taking over the. town'.

          BILLY
          looks through his windshield. Up ahead, he sees

          TRACY
          screaming for help, from a third floor window of her home.

          BILLY
          steers the police car into her driveway. He squeals to
          a stop.
          He grabs his sword and gets out of the car.

          OUTSIDE
          Billy runs to below Tracy's window. He shouts to her.

          BILLY
          Tracy!...It's me! Billy!

          TRACY
          stands in her bedroom. The bedroom door is closed. Locked.

          (a beat) 1
           There's a ladder beside the garage...
          Billy runs to the garage side. e reaches down and picks
          up a rusty aluminum ladd r.

          He puts the ladder up to Tracy's window and climbs to her.

          INT. TRACY'S ROOM


          THE BEDROOM DOOR BURSTS OPEN.
          Two creatures stand there Growling. 'Hungry. They,
          move to Tracy.
          She screams.
          Billy gets to Tracy. He quickly pulls her out of the
          window. They begin to climb down the ladder.

          ON THE GROUND BELOW
          a creature jumps onto the ladder.
          Tracy. is startled. She nearly falls. Billy grabs. a. better
          hold of her. He drops his sword. It falls to the ground
          and lands in the snow.
          The creature looks up and sees Billy and Tracy. A few
          feet above. Mogwai begins to climb the ladder, going
          after them.
          Billy and Tracy start to climb up the ladder.
          But the two other creatures come out of Tracy'.s bedroom
          window. They see Billy and Tracy below. They climb oft
          after them, down the ladder.
          Billy and Tracy are trapped. Sandwiched between the
          creatures.
          Billy looks to his sword on the ground. So far away.

          

          

          

          

          REV. 4/30/82 78
          Thinking fast, Billy pulls the ladder back.
          It sways. He pulls harder.
          The ladder tilts to the ground. Falling.
          The three creatures are thrown to the ground, into the
          deep snow.
          Billy and Tracy ride the ladder down. The snow breaks
          their fall.
          The creatures dig their way out of the snow. They move
          towards Billy and Tracy.
          Billy snaps up his sword and jumps to his feet. Ready
          to fight. He keeps one protective arm around Tracy.
          The creatures surround them. Waiting for the right moment
          to attack.
          One of the creatures moves forward.
          Another leaps behind Billy.
          Billy lunges forward and spears the first creature.
          He quickly reels around, slicing the other creature in
          two.
          Both creatures lie in the snow. Dead.
          Billy turns to the last Mogwai. With two swings of his
          blade, he kills the creature.
          Billy wipes the green blood off his sword with his coat
          sleeve. Breathless, he looks at Tracy .
          Hair .hangs in his eyes. Blood runs down the side of his.
          sweaty, unshaven face. His dark brown eyes stare at Tracy.
          The transformation from meek bank clerk to sexy hero is
          complete.
          He embraces her. They run to the police car and get inside.
          Billy'starts the car. He and Tracy drive off into the
          night.

          They arrive at the outskirts of town. Frank notices some-
          thing up ahead.
          He can see the shadows of the creatures. Crawling on
          houses. Running across the front lawns.
          Frank motions for Gary to slow down.

          FRANK

          Gary gl nce over. Shocked. Horrified.
          Mogwai takes a huge bite out of Frank's arm. He screams.
          Gary turns to help him.

          to be dragged to the ground by creatures.
          Ravaged bodies lie in the snow. Frozen.
          An ambulance is overturned on the roadside.
          Phone lines are town down.

          Billy stops a few feet from the sheriff's car.
          The passenger side is crushed. The driver's side is
          barely damaged, save for a dented, jammed door.
          Gary pounds against-the door. He wants out.
          Billy grabs the car handle. He pulls hard. The door
          pops open. He pulls Gary out.

          They get to the police car. Billy opens the door.

          Tracy.
          She smiles. Glad to see him alive. They kiss. Gary puts
          his arm around her..
          Billy hops into the driver's seat. He rests the sword
          beside him.--He--starts the car and continues to drive.,
          Gary gives Tracy another kiss. He needs her comfort.
          Billy just stares ahead, at the snowy road.

          Closed.. But the upstairs lights are on. Someone is
          home.
          Everything here looks calm. Untouched. Safe.
          The police car pulls into the driveway.

          INSIDE
          Billy turns to Gary and Tracy.

          BILLY
          We're just outside of town...
          Doesn't look like the creature's
          got here yet.
          (a beat)
          Let's go inside and warm up.
          They exit the police car.

          DORRY
          comes to the door. He sees the worn, hollow faces of Gary
          and Tracy. He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy.

          Billy looks at Dorry.

          Dorry bandages Billy's calf. Gary sits with Tracy on
          the sofa.
          Billy finishes telling the full story to everyone.

          BILLY
          .and they originate from this
          marketplace in Hong Kong.
          Dorrystands and shakes his head.

          DORRY
          Hard to believe. Like Satan's
          come to walk the earth.

          BILLY
          (looks at everyone)
          You see...they''re drawn to water.
          Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll
          be leaving town, and heading for the
          water tower-which means they'll have
          to pass by here tonight.
          (a beat)
          We have to get help. These things
          have to be kept under control. If
          they get to the water tower .they
           could spread all over the St ate...
          maybe the Country. They're like
          inhuman divining rods.

          GARY
          Why didn't you think of that before,
          Peltzer?

          BILLY
          I did. But nobody would listen.

          GARY .
          Maybe if you weren't such a nut
          people would believe you.

          Dorry intervenes.

          DORRY
          Nowt boys...arguing won't get us
          anywhere.
          Gary still glares at Billy.

          GARY
          This is your fau t, Peltzer.

          BILLY
          That's not true.

          Stop it.

          GARY
          You did it. You killed all
          those people.. You're. a murderer,
          Peltzer.
          Billy lunges at Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting.
          Dorry and Tracy break it up.

          TRACY
          If we want to stay . alive... We
          have to stick together.
          Billy turns away. Cooling off.
          Gary is comforted by Tracy. But she keeps her eye on
          Billy. Dorry looks at everyone.

          DORRY
          We should get in touch with
          the authorities.

          Gary's cigarette lighter illuminates the room. Everyone
          stays quiet. They listen.
          THE GIGGLING of several creatures echoes from outside.

          BILLY
          They're here.
          A frightened Gary holds Tracy.

          GARY
          Now what do we do?
          The giggling gets louder. Closer. Billy turns to Dorry.

          BILLY
          Do you have a place without win
          dows?... .A place where we could be
          safe?
          Dorry pauses to think.

          Billy pulls up an old wooden'chair.

          LOUD NOISES, CRASHES. BANGS, THUMPS, GIGGLES..
          They echo from OFFSCREEN. The creatures rummage through
          the antique store.

          listening to the sounds. Frightened.

          DORRY
          Mischevious little devils,
          aren't they?
          No one disagrees.
          Tracy suddenly notices something. She cries out.

          I've only been this scared two
          other times in my life. Once
          was when I got drafted. The
          other, was when I was six years
          old.
          (everyone listens)
          It.was Christmas Eve. My sisters
          and I were decorating the tree
          with our Mother. We were singing
          caroles...happy ...excited...
          waiting for Dad to get home from
          work.
          (a beat)
          A few hours passed, and we started
          to worry. Dad wasn't home yet. My
          Mother called the office. They said
          he left.

          (PAUSE)
          After about a week... the police gave
          up. My Mother was close to a nervous
          breakdown... The rest of us weren't
          eating.. .we couldn't sleep.. .Every-
          thing was falling apart.

          (PAUSE)
          It was snowing outside. The house
          was cold. I threw some logs on
          the fire.--..That's when I noticed
          the smell.
          (a beat)
          The firemen came. They broke
          through the chimney top. We were
          all waiting, expecting them to
          pull out some dead cat or bird...
          Instead, they pulled out my Father.

          (PAUSE)
          He was dressed in a Santa Claus
          suit. He had been climbing down
          the chimney on Christmas Eve,
          his arms loaded with presents.

          The coroner said that he lost
          his footing. He slipped and
          broke his neck. Died instantly.
          His body was lodged in the narrow
          chimney shaft.

          (PAUSE)
          ,That how I found out there was
          no Sahta Claus.
          Everyone has a chilled look on their faces. Dorry just
          stares.
          Billy stands and clears his throat..

          BILLY
          Well...I think you should all
          try and get some sleep.
          (a beat)
          I'll watch the door.
          Everyone agrees. Billy moves his chair in front of the
          door.
          .Dorry relaxes.inhis rocking chair.
          Gary stretches out on the sofa, expecting Tracy to cuddle
          with him. Instead,"she walks:over to Billy.

          TRACY
          Billy...
          He looks at her. She gives him a comforting smile.

          TRACY
          I just wanted to say thanks...
          I mean...If it wasn't for you, I
          don't know what any of us would
          have done.
          Billy smiles.

          TRACY
          is it okay if I sleep here? On
          the floor beside you?...I'd feel
          a lot safer.
          Billy nods. Tracy moves a carpet next to Billy's chair.
          She lies on the carpet. She closes her eyes.
          Gary watches from the sofa. Jealous.

          

          

          

          
          Dorry has fallen asleep in his chair.
          Billy sits. Sword on his lap. He guards the door.
          Sounds still echo-from downstairâ¢s,.throughout the antique
          store.

          CLOSE-UP - BILLY
          The horror of it all finally hits him.
          His eyes fill with tears.
          He cries. Alone.

          FADE OUT.

          sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds the sword on

          The others are asleep.
          Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He
          wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword.
          Everyone else wakes from the sound.

          BILLY
          (looking at their
          scared faces)

          They eat burgers and fries. Gary takes a bite of his

          important to get at the creatures.

          they could make it to the water

          show me around.

          TRACY
          What are you going to do if they're
          inside?

          BILLY
          Blow up the theater.
          Everyone seems puzzled. Billy turns to Gary.

          BILLY
          This place has some kind of boiler
          room...with a furnace... right?

          GARY

          BILLY
          (to the others)
          I'll use the gas lines as a bomb.
          The fire will destroy the creatures.
          Dorry looks at Billy.

          DORRY

          TRACY
          Well I'm not staying out here
          alone. It's getting dark.
          Billy nods. -They'll all go in together.

          BILLY
          Okay...just remember;.We've got
          to stick together. And keep close
          to the flashlight. They're scared
          of the light.
          Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight.
          Tracy takes Billy's hand. Gary is jealous.
          They enter the theater.

          INT. THEATER LOBBY

          Gary shines the flashlight.
          The candy counter has been smashed. All of the candy is
          gone.
          The popcorn machine is empty. The soda machine has been
          emptied and turned on its side.
          Billy walks to the theater entrance door. He looks into
          the small window.

          INT. THEATER

          Countless pairs of green eyes shine in the darkness. The
          creatures murmur among themselves.
          Billy whispers to the others.

          BILLY
          They're inside the theater.
          The others peer into the window.

          BILLY
          (to Gary)
          How do we get to the boiler
          room?

          The second reel of "Snow White" fills the screen.
          The seven dwarfs are singing "Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, it's off to
          work we go..." The song echoes through the theater.

          THE CREATURES
          are frightened by the images on screen. The light hurts
          their eyes. But gradually, they become interested in the
          movie.

          Billy and the others move through the darkness. They crawl
          on the floor, on the outside aisle of the theater, to the
          Exit door.
           They move carefully. Slowly. Silently. They make it
           to the Exit. They Crawl out. safe.-
          The creatures still watchthe movie.

          Out of the theater, BillyTracy, Dorry and Gary run to
          the boiler room.

          INT. BOILER ROOM

          Billy walks to the large gas furnace. He examines the
          gas line. He finds the shut-of.f valve and turns off the
          gas.
          Billy takes off his coat and shirt. He removes his T-shirt.
          He looks at Gary.

          BILLY
          Give me your T-shirt.
          Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the
          two shirts together. He winds them into a cord.
          He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to
          pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds
          of metal ring out.

          CLANG, CLANG, CLANG.

          CUT TO:

          INT. THEATER

          The film's reel ends. The screen goes blank.
          The creatures are puzzled. Distracted. They throw
          their candy boxes and paper cups at the screen.
          The CLANG of Billy's sword hitting the pipe is heard.
          Several of the creatures group together. They move from
          their seats, to the exit door. They follow the sound.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          INT. BOILER ROOM

          Billy gives one final hit to. the gas line. The connection
          snaps. He stuffs the line with his and Gary's shirt. He
          turns the gas back on and lights the end of the crumpled.
          shirt with a match. The flame slowly creeps up the shirt,
          to the line.

          BILLY
          We have to get out. Fast.
          Gary points to a rear exit.

          GARY
          That leads outside.

          SEVERAL CREATURES
          burst into the room.
          Gary panics. He pulls out a gun and starts shooting.

          BILLY
          Not your gun. There's too
          many. Use the light.
          Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight.
          A creature leaps atDorry, pinning the old man to the
          ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching.
          Tearing.
          Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures
          off Dorry.
          Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick
          lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai.
          Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some
          of the Mogwai at bay.
          Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas
          line.
          Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry.
          More creatures come through the door.
          Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs
          for the rear exit.

          Billy and Tracy still fight. Billy inches back to the
          rear exit. His arm blindly gropes for the 'door handle.
          The fire isï¿½almost at the gas line.
          Billy's hand reaches the door handle. He opens it.
          He turns to Tracy.

          BILLY

          Billy picks up Dorry's body. Tracy protects him by batting
          away any oncoming creatures.

          from Billy's chest.
          Gary swings. Billy steps back. The tip of the sword
          scratches across his chest.

          Tracy holds the tool box open. Billy forces Mogwai inside.
          He closes the tool box and locks it shut.
          Mogwai is trapped inside. The creature pounds against
          the metal. Its loud cry echoes from inside.
          Billy checks the car's engine.

          Billy's head pops up. His eyes are wide. Hysterical.
          A shocked expression covers his face.

          SEVERAL WORKERS cleaning up the debris, repairing the
          broken Greenhouse windows.
          The workers load the trash onto a dump truck.
          Outside, the snow is melting. The sun shines bright.

          A BURLY, MUSCULAR WORKER
          walks up to the table and picks up the tool box. He shouts
          to another worker.

          THE TOOL BOX
          rests on the seat beside him.

          SUDDENLY
          the tool box begins to shake. Something pounds against it
          from inside.

          THE WORKER
          pulls his van to the roadside. He stares at the shaking
          tool box. His eyes are wide. Scared.
          The worker grabs the tool box. He gets out of his van.

          OUTSIDE
          The tool box shakes and rattles in the worker's hand.
          Frightened, he throws the box-over a hilly, wooded area
          at the side of the road.

          THE TOOL BOX
          tumbles down a steep hill.
          It lands at the bottom and bounces into a

          1 EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - MORNING 1

          The same crowded Chinatown street where Rand Peltzer first
          found Gizmo the Mogwai. As LOCALS bustle past, ANGLE FAVORS
          the stairs to the basement curiosity shop.

          2 INT. MR. WING'S STORE

          MR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the
          Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day.
          As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs.

          3 EXT. STREET 3

           PEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short.
           ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed
           -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows.
           FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the 
           limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three
           big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car.
           INT. MR. WING'S STORE tj.
           Mr. Wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep
           into the store.

           Mister Wi Daniel Clamp would
           like to see you.

           The men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of
          the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen
          fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New
          York's most successful real estate developer.

          CLAMP (ON TV)
          Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's
          out through to key issues, okay?
          I'm prepared to increase my offer
          substantially.

          (BEAT)
          Now, Mister Wing, you're attached
          to your business. I appreciate
          that. I'm attached to my own
          business. I develop the biggest
          buildings in New York, and you
          sell, ah, little things. Fine.
          But I'm not just talking about
          money here.
          On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel
          beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the
          grandiose of a huge office building,..

          When I put up a building, it's the

          the best. People are going to be
          killing each other to get into
          this building --
          The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove
          of the store.

           GIZMO (O.S.)
           Tee vee!

           CLAMP (ON TV)
           Now,'we've been able to reach an
           understanding with everyone on the
           block -- except for you. Let me
           show you what I willing to do
           for you -- a s tand and

           Mr. Wing regards the video image impassively. 


           CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.)
           Please IF us know when you've 
          made a decision, Mister Wing. You
          know, I believe that there's
          always an area of agreement that
          two people can reach.
           The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the 
          wereen, replacing Clamp's image.

          MR. WING
          Yes -- a man can always agree with
          others. It is more difficult to
          agree with oneself.

          FORSTER
           Does that mean you -- 
          He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that
          sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he
          answers Forster.

      

          MR. WING
          I'm sorry. Please tell Mister
          Clamp that the answer is no.

          FORSTER
          Keep the TV.
          As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the
          TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to
          change the TV CHANNEL.
          With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE
          from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie

          STALLONE

          Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an
          arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a
          HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES.

          GIZMO (0.3.)
          Neat!

          But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and
          angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo.

          That's okay. We don't have to

          They arrive at the DOORS to the building's lobby. In addition
          to regular glass doors, there are a couple of REVOLVING DOORS,

          BILLY
          Want to try the revolving doors
          today?
          Before Kate can answer, a WORKER enters one of the revolving
          doors. The power-assisted door, going too fast, WHOOSHES him
          inside, and we HEAR --

          As Billy and Kate enter, they av i6l$ thread their way through
          several WORKERS sprawled in front othe revolving doors. The
          workers are getting dizzily to their feet, gathering their
          spilled briefcases, etc. SPOT bar-codes, like Billy's and
          Kate's, on the chests of several of the workers.
          Kate waves hello to a thirtyish WOMAN (DOREEN) who's guiding a
          TOUR GROUP through the lobby. Doreen wears a uniform like
          Kate's, plus a matching HAT in the shape of the building.

          The Clamp Centre's "nerve center" looks like an air traffic
          control tower: TECHNICIANS hunch over meters, monitors, and
          switches, tracking the building's systems.
          Forster comes in and walks past several technicians, looking
          over their shoulders. One computer monitor tracks the
          elevators' movements, while others give spy-camera views of
          EMPLOYEES in corridors, bathrooms, etc.
          Forster talks to a TECHNICIAN who mans controls labelled "WHITE

          Then, as Gizmo's singin news, Billy's eyes fall on the right
          covered cage -- and theeaming SCALPELS arranged next to it.
          Billy heads back to the copying machine. On the way, he flips
          the latch on the monkeys' cage --
          -- and is back at the copier in time to look up, "surprised,"
          as the excited monkeys scamper past his into the center of the

          hard to say which of then is more excited.
          But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo
          into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier

          Great. There's this very chic new

          clean the fish right at your table.

          Sounds terrific.

          MARLA
          Let me just grab my coat, and I'll
          be right back.
          As Marla goes O.S., Billy slips Gizmo's drawer open and talks
          into it.

          A JANITOR, pushing a cart of cleaning supplies, comes into the
          office area. Gizmo, on the floor, peeks around a corner to
          watch as the cart's wheels rumble past him.
          As SEEN by Gizmo, the towering janitor stops at the department's
          WATER FOUNTAIN and tries to get a drink. The fountain's spigot
          OVERSHOOTS, giving the janitor a SPLASH in the face.
          Gizmo inches away from the source of the water, and -- seeing a
          puddle on the carpet where the water landed -- carefully avoids
          it. He keeps moving, and evades a second ARC of errant water
          from the fountain.
          The janitor decides t )gx,the fountain. Attacking the spigot
           with a wrench, he sends off 1morq STREAMS of water. To duck
          0 them, Gizmo takes cover, back, isu; under Billy's desk...
          .and doesn't see a big SPLASH F'o }wezï¿½ hit Billy's Chinatown
          picture. While Gizmo, thinking the danger is passed, steps out
          from under the desk, the bright colors of Billy's painting blur,
          and the blob of water ROLLS DOWN the illustration board...
          .down the side of the desk...
          Gizmo looks up, but too late. From his POV, the blob of paint-
          tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. It HITS him --
          -- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in
          â¬.g., CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. The
          janitor leaves, and Gizmo SCREAMS, as -- THWIP! THWIP! -- two
          tiny FURBALLS shoot out of his body and land in the open DRAWER
          of a nearby filing cabinet.
          THWIP! The painful Mogwai replication continues, and a third
          furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.
          THWIP! The fourth and final offspring shoots from Gizmo's body,
          and -- as Gizmo watches in horror and pain -- BOUNCES crazily
          around the office area, a little Superball of fur.
          As Gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn
          Mogwai HANDS reach out of the filing cabinet drawer, gripping

          S
          the top edge from inside.

          Mogwais are revealed, standing in the drawer: GEORGE AND LENNY,
          an inseparable pair. Lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while
          George is small, with a criminal caginess -- he gets Lenny to do
          everything for him.
          Gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed
          start to ROCK back and forth -- but is distracted as the
          BOUNCING FURBALL hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets
          up onto a DESKTOP.
          To SOUND FX of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball
          rolls into a desk corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds --
          upside-down. This is DAFFY, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic
          Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate
          with the great Daffy Duck.
          In the first seconds following birth, Daffy goes daffy over the
          very fact of being alive. He sees his little hands and feet
          unfold,. and gives a WHOOP

          .until MOHAWK, the fourth new Mogwai, emerges. This guy is
          pure, malicious evil, a new strain of badness. Even as a furry
          Mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach.
          While Daffy, up on the desktop, starts playing with everything

          Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT
          opening low on the wall behind him.

          Maria leans closer to Billy, her tone more intimate than before.

          I can help you reach those goals,

          MARGE
          This is how we used to cook for big
          groups, before we had our microwave
          ovens and the other modern
          appliances. It would take days to
          plan the menu, and hours over a hot
          stove to do the cooking. But now,
          we can make this same tuna-noodle
          cheez-product chowder surprise in
          just a few minutes, and you can
          feed anything from a high school
          reunion to a complete chain gang
          with this kind of quantity.

          Huh. Brownout or something.
          Marge HEARS a TAPPING noise from inside the soup pot. Confused,
          she lifts the lid -- and JUMPS BACK, as LENNY -- now a GREMLIN,
          but his dopey face still recognizable -- sits up in the soup
          pot, wearing a chef's hat, and SPLATTERS Marge with orange
          noodle-casserole GOO. He whips out a TURKEY EASTER, and SQUIRTS
          Marge with it.

          MARGE

          AAAGGHHH! WHAT IS IT?
          At the sound of Gremli LAUGHTER, she wheels to see GEORGE, a
           GREMLIN in an apron, counter behind her. As Marge turns
           to the Cameraman for pr tl George points to two MICROWAVE

          backs out of the room.
          As the tourists go, the Gremlins turn savagely toward the ovens.
          George whispers to Lenny, who nods obediently and throws several
          METAL UTENSILS into the microwaves. The Gremlins close the
          ovens and start them up. The ovens fill with furious ARCS of
          blue light --

          MARGE
          Look out!
          -- and THE OVENS EXPLODE, showering the set with GLASS. As
          Marge and her cameraman escape the studio, the ovens catch FIRE.
          The flames lick up toward the ceiling --
          -- and set off the SPRINKLERS. George and Lenny grin, standing
          tall to shower in the spray. As the water hits, BUBBLES appear
          on the Gremlins' backs. Close on the bubbles, CAMERA finds the
          tiny heads of GREMLIN OFFSPRING, getting ready to burst out.
          As the studio fills with the ominous SMOKE and COLORED LIGHT of
          Gremlin multiplication, Kate runs from the room.

          WALLY
          Hey! My vegetable medley!
          Before Wally can stop him, a GREMLIN goes over to the potted
          VEGETABLE PLANTS with TUBES connecting them to a glass vial.
          He grabs the vial, EATS it...and stands still for a moment...
          .as his EARS turn into leafy clumps of ROMAINE LETTUCE.
          Wally tries to move on him, but the Gremlin menaces his with a
          claw, and goes on to grab a vial from a CAULIFLOWER PLANT...
          CHAOS ensues, as more Gremlins go after more vials and the
          scientists' efforts to stop them result mainly in trashed

          EQUIPMENT:
          ANGLE on a Gremlin trying a vial marked SEX HORMONE. The
          Gremlin's face registers big consumer satisfaction -- he downs
          the rest of the vial in one gulp.

          DR. CATHETER (O. .) ï¿½) V
          My God!
          As the lab's chief researcher stands in the doorway, unable to

          believe his eyes, another GREMLIN grabs a vial attached to a
          BRAIN that site in a tank of saline solution.

          painfully croaks out a few WORDS --

          BRAIN GREMLIN
          I...want...to --
          Then, suddenly, the transformation takes hold, in thrashing
          Jekyll-and-Hyde HISTRIONICS that send the Gremlin rolling on
          the floor. When he stands, he wears a pair of HORN-RIMMED
          GLASSES, and SPEAKS FLUENTLY in a new VOICE, similar to that of

          GEORGE PLIMPTON.

          grabs a collecting VIAL connected by surgical tubing to the

          watching, surprised, as his hands become WEBBED, like bat wings.

          Billy is blinking himself groggily to consciousness, seeing the room through
          the BLUR of concussion. There's an unpleasant, whining NOISE --
          -- as Billy SEES Daffy, now in DENTIST'S WHITES, revving up the high-speed
          drill and moving in on him. Daffy's FACE MASK doesn't hide his goofy, eager

          EYES --
          Billy flails desperately, but it just leaves his mouth unprotected. Daffy
          wedges a CLAW in, moves in with the drill ---

          Daffy turns on him with the drill, aiming for his chest --
          -- but Mr. Futterman reaches overhead, turns on the bright
          Castle LAMP, and aims it at Daffy -- who SHRIEKS, drops the
          drill, and runs from the dentist's office.

          To survive a war, you've got to
          become war.

          over his body and to his hairy legs as he writhes, tumbles over,
          and DIES.

	FADE IN:

	ROLL CREDITS OVER:

	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN

	VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
	brilliant greens:

	A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

	pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
	soaked lawn.

	FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

	No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

	GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER

	At the bottom of a water hazard.

	PALM FRONDS

	After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
	surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
	air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
	Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
	palms to

	A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.

	Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
	moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
	it out. The trousers walk out after it.

	HANDS

	Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
	golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
	gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

	YELLOW TROUSERS

	In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
	journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
	putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
	rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
	and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
	and into the hole.

	THE GLOVED HAND

	Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
	golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
	bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
	out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
	The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
	firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
	face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
	squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

	We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
	him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
	another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
	rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
	One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
	could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

	MARTIN'S ARM

	Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
	later in the distance, the

	RED SWEATER'S HEAD

	Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
	body crumples to the green.

	MARTIN

	Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
	the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
	absently...

				  MARTIN
		Hooked it. 

	INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

	The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
	club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
	a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
	peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		I'd come to the realization that 
		everything I'd based my life on was 
		false. And that my life had no 
		meaning.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
			(to Martin)
		He gets this way when he hits over 
		eighty-five.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		It seemed like my life was slipping 
		away, somehow. I was a knot in the 
		middle of a wet rope. Everything was 
		futile and nothing had value.

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		That's the way life is. The only 
		meaning and value is what we create. 
		Through structure, and discipline. 
		Though they seem to limit our freedom, 
		they actually give us great comfort. 
		Your problem is you're looking for 
		some great answer. Some ultimate 
		truth. When what you really should 
		do is go to work and go home.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		And take golf lessons.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		That's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
		story please? I began my search for 
		meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
		Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
		went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
		herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
		and a psychic. And they all pretty 
		much say the same stuff.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
		telling you the same thing? You're 
		insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Basically the same thing. In a very 
		evolved, esoteric way.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		To make a long story short...

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		--Thank God--

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		...at last I found the holistic system 
		of systems that opened up the doors 
		of heaven for me right here on earth. 
		And everyday I see the world through 
		the eyes of a child. A world of 
		creation and wonder.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Jesus...

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Overflowing with love.

				  MARTIN
		Tell me about it.

	Club Member #1 turns to Martin.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
		secrets of your universe are divided 
		up into eight easily digestible 
		slices.

	Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
	hands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
	wail.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		See, see. It's in the accessible and 
		everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
		day you have a little slice of 
		peace...

	INSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD

	A pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

				  MARTIN
		Oh I see. You got your individual 
		slices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
		self-love, justice, and harmony.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		You open 'em up and there's the 
		sayings, stories, little bites of 
		insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
		Week.

				  MARTIN
		So you eat-- read it everyday?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		And these pan pizzas have opened up 
		the doors to heaven?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Correct.
			(re: the card)
		That's for you. Keep it.

	Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

	EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

	The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
	toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
	the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

				  MARTIN AT CAR
		He fishes out the laminated "Personal 
		Pan Power" card, looks at it, and 
		tosses it onto the ground. Police 
		cars, now visible in the distance, 
		wind into the long club driveway. 
		Martin gets into his car and pulls

	As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
	to a stop on it.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
	down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
	of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
	Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
	and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
	impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
	done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
	him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
	massively uploading the world around him:

	Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
	crouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
	supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
	in arm, smiling, etc.

	INT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY

	The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
	Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
	already begun.

				  DRIVER
		How was your day, today, sir?

				  MARTIN
		Effective. But to tell you the truth, 
		I've lost my passion for work.

				  DRIVER
		Do you like the people you work with?

				  MARTIN
		I work alone.

				  DRIVER
		That's it then. That's it. I've always 
		been alone. That's why I'm a good 
		driver. I can handle it. See, I can 
		think on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
		thinker. And I can sit there in front 
		of your house for two hours and it 
		don't bother me. Some people can't 
		do it! Some people are ranting and 
		raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
		get out here and get in this car, I 
		can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
		go? You're gonna wind up back in 
		your garage at seven o'clock at night. 
		You ain't going nowhere. You leave 
		your house in the morning you get 
		back to your house in the evening. 
		What's the big deal, right?

				  MARTIN
		You understand the psychology of the 
		job.

				  DRIVER
		I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
		they can't handle it.

	INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

	The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
	Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

				  DRIVER
		You look like you're far away. Far 
		away and thinking about other things. 
		I'm right about that, aren't I?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DRIVER
		Well, let's just say that sometimes 
		I'm right. Sometimes you are.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
		natural.

				  DRIVER
			(laughs to himself at 
			this great truth)
		It's only natural....

	The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

				  DRIVER
		I been looking at you, and I've 
		decided that I want to share something 
		with you.

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

				  DRIVER
		Because your problem is you're bored. 
		And you have a very big mind.
			(beat)
		I am part of what I call a brain 
		syndicate.

	No reaction from Martin.

				  DRIVER
		I am part of a network of minds, a 
		group of five people who are all 
		connected, over hundreds, even 
		thousands of miles, through the mind. 
		We can think with each other, think 
		for each other. I can be driving 
		somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
		whatever it is-- and at the same 
		time be thinking a thought in someone 
		else's mind, far away. Running someone 
		else's brain.

				  MARTIN
			(indicates)
		Up on the right.

				  DRIVER
		And when you think of it, it's not 
		so surprising that a small group of 
		people control the whole world, is 
		it?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
	East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
	watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
	the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
	it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
	to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
	depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
	a moment.

				  MARTIN
		If it's not there, I can't proceed. 
		Tell them.

	Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
	waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
	on the bed.

				  MARTIN
		Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
		I'm only in town tonight.

	He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
	metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
	silencer.

				  MARTIN
		What's different this time than the 
		last time? I have to be down front...

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

	Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
	scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
	across the arm of a chair.

				  MARTIN
		...I don't bother to call anyone 
		else because you always take care of 
		me.

	He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
	a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
	scope and sees

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

	A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
	is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
	gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
	his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
	hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

				  MARTIN
		Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
		full here.

	He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
	the messenger.

				  MARTIN
		Good. Account number 3649367, transfer 
		to account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
		Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
		Mr. Duckman. If there are any 
		problems, access file 673594638-IO-
		98, and look at it.

	Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
	rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
	high-rise.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1

	Of a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
	suits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
	man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
	Saville Row finery.

	MARTIN

	Takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
	the rifle toward Window #2.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2

	of an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

	MARTIN

	concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
	left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
	between Window #2 and Window #1.

	STREET

	the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
	a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
	just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
	Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
	two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
	a parked car in front of them.

	MARTIN

	withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
	begins to break down the rifle.

				  MARTIN
		Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
		playoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
		thousand dollars for one seat...

	Martin listens patiently as he works.

	EXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT

	DOORMAN'S HANDS

	unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

	MARTIN

	just finishes packing.

				  MARTIN
		...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
		I have to do to get courtside tickets 
		for the Knicks...?

	STREET

	The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
	two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
	Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

	DOORMAN

	a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
	handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
	flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
	Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

	MARTIN

	is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

				  MARTIN
		Never mind. I gotta go.

	Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE

	of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
	He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
	FIRES both guns.

	MARTIN

	reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
	from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
	exit.

	HIGH-RISE FOYER

	Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
	bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
	makes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
	He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

	MARTIN

	his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
	and walks down the street.

	DOORMAN

	now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
	walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY

	Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
	on the cellular.

				  MARTIN
		...Tell them that's not my problem. 
		I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
		not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

				  MARCELLA
		Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

				  MARTIN
		Patch him through....

	Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
	recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
	GROCER.

				  MARTIN
		What do you want?

				  GROCER
		I'm setting up a concern that would 
		enable those of us in our rarefied 
		profession to consolidate our efforts.

				  MARTIN
		Like a union?

				  GROCER
		Like a club. Work less, make more.

				  MARTIN
		Thank you, no.

				  GROCER
		We could be working together, making 
		big money, killing important people... 
		I'm willing to let you in on the 
		ground floor.

				  MARTIN
		And you could be... sort of like... 
		a father figure to me....

	Grocer ignores this.

				  GROCER
		It's a free-market evolution. You'll 
		wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
		to run together when you were a 
		rookie. I don't want to run against 
		you. This thing's real. Everybody's 
		in.

				  MARTIN
		Not me. So don't paw at me with your 
		dirty little guild.

				  GROCER
		I'm gonna get you, kid.

	Martin hangs up and pulls away.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
	an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
	speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
	He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
	and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

	INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT

	Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
	drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
	the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
	bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
	them down with a reddish-orange beverage.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
	closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
	his chest.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
		been ten years? Where are you now...?

	After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
	the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

	CLOSE-UP: WIRE

	from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
	one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
	walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
	box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
		canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
		perhaps in charge of appearances for 
		the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
	and twice as long, by a string.

	VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER

	The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
	MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
	snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
	We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
	KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
	the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
	in the floor.

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
	thread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
	floor, his attention shifts to the

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
	make their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Could it be that you're like Chip 
		Longfellow, at the trade-relations 
		tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
		owns a cheese shop...!

	MARTIN

	adjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
	fiber-optic cable with the other.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
	the drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
	face...

	A DROP FALLS

	It misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
	CAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
	back up through the hole in the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
		evokes so many memories...!

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
			(hushed)
		Fuck!

	MARTIN

	stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
	of frame.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Some good. Some bad. But all 
		interesting...

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
	dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
	in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
	Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
	Bodyguard levels his at Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Freeze! Police!

	The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
	through the head.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...As a graduate of the class of 
		1984, you are someone special...

	Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
	key chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
	the door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
	him into the apartment.

	INT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

	Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
	the bedroom and slips across the threshold.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Whenever news of you filters back, 
		the school is excited and proud of 
		your accomplishments...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
	gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
	opens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
	returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
		you well to lead the kind of life 
		that makes an impact on the world...

	Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
	his barrel to the man's forehead.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Remember, "there's no where you 
		can go that you haven't learned how 
		to go in time... It's easy..."

				  HUSKY MAN
			(in severe pain)
		Whatever it is that I'm doing that 
		you don't like I'll stop doing it.

				  MARTIN
		It's not me.

	Martin cocks the gun....

	EXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY

	The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
	bungalows.

	INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY

	A small suite of dry-walled offices.

	EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY

	is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
	of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
	is MARCELLA MAYES.

				  MARCELLA
		...So come on back to the old oak 
		tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion 
		committee."

	Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
	the first time, Martin looks scared.

				  MARTIN
		Throw that away.

				  MARCELLA
		This?

				  MARTIN
		Don't tease me. You know what I do 
		for a living.

				  MARCELLA
		It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
		How was the trip?

				  MARTIN
		Tedious. I now authorize you to throw 
		away all personal mail.

				  MARCELLA
		All of it?

				  MARTIN
		And not show it to me. Ever again.

				  MARCELLA
		That's going to cost.

				  MARTIN
		I'll pay.

	Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
	stops him.

				  MARCELLA
		They're not happy, sir.

				  MARTIN
		I'm not happy.

				  MARCELLA
		They say their friend was suppose to 
		have a heart attack and die in his 
		sleep.

				  MARTIN
		He didn't.

				  MARCELLA
		They blame you for the compromise.

				  MARTIN
		And they want me to make up for it.

				  MARCELLA
		In Detroit. This weekend.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them that's impossible. I need 
		my normal lead time.

				  MARCELLA
		They were very upset.

				  MARTIN
		Would you describe their position as 
		inflexible?

				  MARCELLA
		Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

	Marcella looks concerned.

				  MARCELLA
		And sir, I also get that broken-
		mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
		thirteenth kind of feeling about 
		this one....

				  MARTIN
		There's nothing to be done about it.

				  MARCELLA
		I liquidated the last account in 
		Zurich, and split it into two new 
		ones in Estonia.

				  MARTIN
		Good. What else? Anything interesting?

				  MARCELLA
		Mmm, not really. But you're gonna 
		love this one.

	She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

				  MARCELLA
		Enough?

				  MARTIN
		Never enough.

				  MARCELLA
		But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
		so easy.

	Martin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
	shredder at the side of her desk.

				  MARTIN
		I have scruples. Next.

				  MARCELLA
		Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
		a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

	She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
	and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
	private office.

	MARTIN'S OFFICE

	Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
	walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
	holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
	manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
	books on import/export. He sits and stares.

	NEW ANGLE

	Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
	his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

	C.U. MARTIN'S TEETH

	The dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
	a hummingbird.

				  MARCELLA
			(off-screen)
		You should get going....

	MARTIN

	pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
	protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
	tweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

	FOYER

	Martin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
	him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

				  MARCELLA
		Don't forget your identity.

				  MARTIN
		See you next week.

	Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
	the envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
	out, over his shoulder...

				  MARTIN
		Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

	INT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Martin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
	envelope, now open.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Why don't you want to go to your 
		high school reunion?

				  MARTIN
		It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
		I have in common with those people? 
		Or with anyone?

	DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
	wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
	old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
	a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
	a tough question.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You went to school with these people.

				  MARTIN
		Come on.

				  DR. OATMAN
		We've spent a lot of time discussing 
		those years. Remember we said that 
		fear is a transfer of the bodily 
		hurt associated by experience with 
		the thing feared, to the thought of 
		the thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
		distinctly imagining its bite.

				  MARTIN
		Shouldn't you be taking notes?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Tell me about your vision of the 
		reunion.

	CLOSE-UP - MARTIN

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - FROM ABOVE

	Of a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
	doing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
	SIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
	DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
	OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
	OFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.

							   CUT BACK TO:

	MARTIN AND OATMAN

				  MARTIN
		It'll be depressing.

				  DR. OATMAN
		How do you know?

				  MARTIN
		I just know.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Say more.

				  MARTIN
		They'll have husbands and wives and 
		children and houses and dogs.... 
		made themselves a part of something. 
		And they can talk about what they 
		do. What am I going to say?
			(sarcastic)
		"I killed the President of Paraguay 
		with a fork."

	Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You needn't be so frank with me about 
		your work.

				  MARTIN
		Why not. I trust you. You couldn't 
		turn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
		privilege... and I don't want to be 
		"withholding"... and I know where 
		you live.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You know where I live?

				  MARTIN
		We're both professionals, Oatman.

				  DR. OATMAN
		I think what you fear Martin is 
		domesticity. It's the greatest fear 
		that men have who belong to Western 
		Culture. It's centuries old. Like 
		King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
		century who decided one day that he 
		was so bored with his dreary life at 
		home with his wife he thought, "Well, 
		wouldn't it be great if we hit the 
		road and fought... oh... the 
		Saracens."  So he put the word out 
		and was amazed when a million men 
		signed up and all of them wanted to 
		go and fight in distant lands and do 
		terrible things to people rather 
		than stay at home with their families.

				  MARTIN
		So you're saying that Ulysses--
		everything he said to his queen when 
		he came back--everything was a lie? 
		He just wanted to fuck around?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		Mmm.

	Beat.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And how have you been feeling about 
		your... work lately?

				  MARTIN
		Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
		just getting hard to go to work in a 
		good mood. I'm starting to think 
		I've been in the business too long. 
		Last week I did a guy younger than 
		me.

	INT. CHURCH -

	SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

	MARTIN

	From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
	the altar.  A priest in fact.

	MARTIN'S HANDS

	open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
	squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
	returns the chalice to the cabinet.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		The church seems to be purging itself 
		of it's pedophile.

	MARTIN

	Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
	watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
	prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
	altar.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		It's a bull market.

	C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET

	The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
	the ground.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Anyway, that never use to happen. I 
		was always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
		one of the guys.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Maybe some of the discomfort you're 
		feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over 
		the innocent people you've killed.

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				  MARTIN
		If I show up at your door, chances 
		are you did something to bring me 
		there. I don't care about that stuff, 
		anyway.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What stuff?

				  MARTIN
			(dismissive)
		Morality.

	Oatman's glad the session's just about over.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Go to your reunion, Martin. See those 
		people and discover what they mean 
		to you. Try not to kill anybody for 
		a few days, see how you feel.

				  MARTIN
		If I get antsy I'll kill a few small 
		animals.

				  OATMAN
		Now we're making progress.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	Very dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
	what he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
	The cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
	finally coming to a photo album.

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Just a minute.

	INSERT-ALBUM

	A teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
	poses with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
	but her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
	the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
	"IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."

	MARTIN

	turns the page.

	INSERT-PHOTO ALBUM

	A photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
	a bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
	NEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would 
	you rather...?!"

				  CAT
		Meow!

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
	him, moaning hungrily--

				  MARTIN
		Food soon...

	Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
	bottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
	hydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
	and thirty cans of CATFOOD.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna or liver?

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna it is.

	He opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
	the cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
	YEARBOOK. Flips it open....

	INSERT-YEARBOOK

	A picture of a senior class "Blues Brothers" party: a group 
	of teens mug to the camera in Blues Brothers get-ups. 
	Sprinters race for a finish line, their chests stretching 
	for the tape.

	DEBI NEWBERY'S SENIOR PICTURE

	A more mature version of the girl in the album. Her name 
	appears under his picture...

	INT. GROCER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Track light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
	wearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
	vegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
	carrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
	Grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

	INT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Grocer enters the main room of the villa-style A-frame. He 
	moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a COMPUTER.

	ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS

		  "Click OK for remote access caller"

	OK is clicked.

		   "Availability for two days in Detroit area"

				 "Terms"

				"$560,000"

				  "When"

				  "Now"

				"OK/ FAX materials"

	Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a 
	moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
	beeps.

	  "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

	Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
	graphic appears:

		"Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

	Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
	juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

	INT. PLANE - NIGHT

	Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
	on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
	they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
	a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
	he sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

	INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

	At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
	two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
	blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
	crowd.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always say 
		that. I'm telling you, you never met 
		the man.

				  MCCULLERS
		Seventeen months ago I was posting a 
		walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He 
		never saw me. But I saw him, though.

				  LARDNER
		Lisbon?

				  MCCULLERS
		In Portugal, yes.

	In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
	the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
	drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

				  LARDNER
		Here's the news: He hasn't been in 
		Portugal since '90. I know that from 
		the file. Why don't you read the 
		file, man?

				  MCCULLERS
		In fact, I think I talked with him, 
		in Bonn.

	Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always have 
		to know everybody. Why don't I just 
		take the weekend off and let you 
		kill him. Since you two are so close.

	They exit.

	EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

	INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport 
	artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...with highs today in the upper 
		seventies. Related stocks on Wall 
		Street today as scandal continues to 
		rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech 
		Center...

	MARTIN'S CAR

	blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
	eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied 
	by two figures.

	INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE

	are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...An unknown "whistle-blower" has 
		leaked a number of critical flaws in 
		the safety designs of next year's 
		models to authorities that could 
		cost millions in recalls....

	MARTIN

	flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes 
	fascistically.

				  MARTIN
		Mein hero.

	...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon 
	Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.

	EXT. HIGHWAY-

	Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. 
	Dig it...

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar 
	voice....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
			(on radio)
		--this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the 
		time. Oldies from the eighties. It's 
		a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

								   CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH

	lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a 
	microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her 
	face move in front of her mouth as she speaks....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--and I'm ready for some good tunes 
		and angry talk. Or angry tunes and 
		good talk--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the 
	windshield...

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau 
		Twins and get over the goo-angry-
		talking music. As you know--

								   CUT TO:

	THE DEEJAY'S HANDS

	as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the 
	mic.

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--for some moments in life there are 
		no words, and a little nonsense now 
		and then is relished by the wisest 
		man--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district.

								   CUT TO:

	HER MOUTH

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--The Cocteau Twins, though also a 
		band of the nineties, will be aired 
		due to the fact that they created 
		their own language to sing by--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a 
	storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the 
	passenger window....

								   CUT TO:

	DEBI NEWBERRY

	the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive 
	chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window 
	behind it that opens to the street....

				  DEBI
		--Now that's freedom--

	she swivels in the chair to face the street....

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow.

	DEBI

	Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned 
	by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly.

				  DEBI
		--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where 
		are all the good men dead? In the 
		heart or in the head? Back later....

	MARTIN

	Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the 
	street and disappears....

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING

	Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner 
	with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops 
	as he slows and pulls over....

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

	Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then 
	back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car.

	WIDE SHOT

	of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle 
	of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves 
	in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the 
	clerk inside.

				  MARTIN
		What are you doing here?

	CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question.

				  CARL
		A double shift. What's it look like?
			(softening)
		Can I help you with something?

	Martin's head pans the room, processing.

				  MARTIN
		I don't think so.

	EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING

	Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar 
	landscape.

				  MARTIN
			(into phone)
		Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick 
		up if you're there... It's Martin 
		Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not 
		here. My house is gone and now there's 
		a 7-11 here... And that's 
		unfortunate... You can never go home 
		again, Dr. Oatman.

	Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		But I guess you can shop there.

	INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She 
	banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late 
	fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching 
	her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, 
	a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from 
	Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating.

				  NURSE
		Mary, your son's here.

	The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and 
	pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They 
	start out of the room.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, 
	baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes 
	and hacks.

				  MARY
		I bought a new rug.

				  MARTIN
		That's wonderful, Mom.

				  MARY
		What's a revival tent?

				  MARTIN
		It's a place where religious people--

				  MARY
			(knowingly)
		Marlin Perkins and Jim!

				  MARTIN
		Jim?

				  MARY
		His assistant. He acted like Marlin's 
		son, only he wasn't. At least they 
		never said he was... I bet they were 
		lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. 
		Wild Kingdom my ass!

	Mary coughs horribly.

				  MARTIN
		It's good to see you. I'm sure you're 
		curious about what I've been doing.

				  MARY
		I spoke to your father the other 
		day.

				  MARTIN
		I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

				  MARY
		Nature made him then broke the mold.

	Martin decides to change the subject.

				  MARTIN
		They told me you're taking lithium, 
		mom.

				  MARY
		Yes, they give me headaches. I have 
		a headache.

				  MARTIN
		You have a headache?

				  MARY
		I have a headache. You have a 
		headache?

				  MARTIN
		No, I don't have one.

				  MARY
		You don't have a headache. I have a 
		headache.

	Mary leans in close, smiling.

				  MARY
		We had a good laugh, didn't we?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah. I guess we did.

	EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to 
	it.

				  MARY
		Why don't you return this car and 
		borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to 
		the rent-a-car so you can get a ride 
		back.

				  MARTIN
		I think I'll go see Debi today.

				  MARY
		Of course you will.

				  MARTIN
		I can't think of anything to say to 
		her that seems appropriate given I 
		left and never said goodbye to her.

				  MARY
		Take care of her. She's a keeper.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  MARY
		And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro 
		on foreign exchange?

				  MARTIN
		I have always thought about her and 
		missed her.

	A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.

				  MARY
		Separate the wheat from the chaff 
		and you've got the candle cat.

	Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes 
	at Martin, taking him in.

				  MARY
		Remember no matter how impossible 
		your problems feel. I've known people 
		without a chance in the world. And 
		all of a sudden, they have lives.  
		Time allows miracles. Let yourself 
		breathe, son.

	Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse 
	spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is 
	somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once 
	more to connect.

				  MARTIN
		Mom...

	The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks 
	up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel 
	Merman, arms out Broadway style.

				  MARY
		"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ 
		What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ 
		Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt 
		someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ 
		Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ 
		We really mean it!"

	Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.

				  MARY
		Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's 
		your name?

	EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY

	Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of 
	headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...

				  MARTIN
		Hey Pop... You got off easy. The 
		house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
		pharmacological punching bag and I 
		murder for cash. If you were here I 
		think you'd be proud.

	He drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY

	The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. 
	Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs 
	the steel-sided briefcase.

				  MARTIN
		pries out a wall vent, slides in the 
		case and replaces the vent.

	EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of 
	town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger 
	window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his 
	lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings 
	his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...

				  MCCULLERS
		"...Against the wind... just a young 
		man running... Against the wind... 
		let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on 
		it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

	McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. 
	He nudges Lardner, and points.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.

	of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the 
	radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into 
	the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare 
	at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment...

				  DEBI
			(on air, groping)
		WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. 
		Oldies from the eighties. That was 
		ah... the Specials. Doing... one of 
		their songs...

	Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back 
	to turntable A and lets the record roll on.

				  DEBI
		...and here's another.

	Debi swivels around to face Martin.

				  MARTIN
		"Oldies from the eighties?"

	After a long pause....

				  DEBI
		I just play my own collection.

				  MARTIN
		It's nice to see you again.

	Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock.

				  MARTIN
		How long has it been?

				  DEBI
		Since you stood me up on prom night 
		and vanished without saying a word?

				  MARTIN
		Ten years, I think. What I miss?

	Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense.

				  DEBI
		Well, let me see... they tore down 
		the George Orwell monument and put 
		up a bust of George Michael. Main 
		Street's a four-laner, no left turns 
		four to seven. I was married and 
		divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now 
		officially the new sister city to 
		Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have 
		fiber-optic town meetings every two 
		months.

				  MARTIN
		Here is now there. There is here.

	Their eyes lock on each other...

				  DEBI
		Those are the headlines.

	The request line buzzes.

				  DEBI
		Hold that thought.
			(into phone)
		WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, 
		all the...
			(pauses)
		No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

	Beat. Debi makes the move.

				  DEBI
		Tell me about yourself.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in California most of the time. 
		Traveling a lot on business. That's 
		about it, really.

				  DEBI
		That's it?

				  MARTIN
		Not much else.

				  DEBI
		What's your business?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  DEBI
		Professional killer. Do you get dental 
		with that?

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I'm in town for a few days, 
		anyway.

	They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. 
	Martin gets the fear, breaks it off.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

				  DEBI
		Okay.

	Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin steps out of the storefront station along the 
	fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the 
	middle of the street with a strained look on his face.

	INT. LARDNER & MCCULLERS' COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	LARDNER & MCCULLERS' P.O.V.

	of Martin standing in the street.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	They frown, wondering at Martin's next move.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi lost in thought, still. After a moment, she sits upright 
	and flips the "ON-AIR" switch.

				  DEBI
			(into mike)
		A man comes to you. He is from the 
		past bringing you pain long since 
		put behind you. He says peculiar 
		things and leaves abruptly. It all 
		comes flooding back...

	EXT. STREET -

	Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes 
	determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi broadcasting...

				  DEBI
		It felt like an apparition, or some 
		cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time 
		warp I'd been thrust back into without 
		warning. There's a strangeness in 
		the air and I don't mind telling 
		you, I'm a little spooked. He was a 
		man from my past. A man I loved. A 
		man who disappeared.

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin walking back into the station.

				  DEBI
		A man who's walking back into the 
		station.

	Martin comes into the booth. The temperature rises as they 
	square off.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE -

				  LARDNER
		Well?

				  MCCULLERS
		I don't think so.

				  LARDNER
		Well, remember when Frysal's men 
		paid off the Deejay in Cairo to 
		announce a bogus press conference in 
		the --

				  MCCULLERS
		--Nooo--

				  LARDNER
		--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in 
		'72. A local radio station started 
		broadcasting news of the massacre 
		two minutes before it happened.

	McCullers is not to be outdone.

				  MCCULLERS
		That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

				  LARDNER
		It was the PLO.

				  MCCULLERS
		Whatever.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH

	Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace. They break 
	away.

				  DEBI
		Sit.

	Martin obeys. Debi clandestinely flips the "ON-AIR" switch 
	as she drops into her chair. The "ON-AIR" light bar goes on 
	above and behind Martin. Unbeknownst to him their conversation 
	is put out over the airwaves.

				  DEBI
		All right mystery man. I want some 
		answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. 
		Two young lovers with frightening 
		natural chemistry. The girl sits in 
		a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at 
		her father's house waiting for the 
		most romantic night of her young 
		life. The boy never shows up, until 
		now. So, what's the question?

				  MARTIN
		Where have I been?

				  DEBI
		More like what happened? What 
		happened, Mr. Blank?

				  MARTIN
		I don't know exactly. I could venture 
		a guess but it would sound like a 
		rationalization... I thought you 
		know... maybe seeing you, some 
		friends, my house... of course now a 
		7-11--

				  DEBI
		--Torn down in the name of convenience--

				  MARTIN
		--and I guess, sure, seeing you would 
		be part of that whole equation... I 
		suppose the most important thing, 
		really. I don't know. Anyway, this 
		whole thing's my therapist's idea. 
		It's my shrink, really.

				  DEBI
		Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

				  MARTIN
		You see someone?

				  DEBI
		Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade 
		later, and you want to sort things 
		out with me. The question now is, do 
		I allow you... access... to my being?

	Martin says nothing.

				  DEBI
		All right then. Would you like to 
		share any more deeply personal 
		thoughts with our listening audience 
		before we go to our phone poll and 
		see how the folks in radioland come 
		down on this one?

	A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to 
	bolt.

				  DEBI
		Should a broken-hearted girl give a 
		guy a second chance at love....

	Debi jabs a phone line on the console.

				  DEBI
			(HARD)
		You're on the air.

	Martin deflates.

				  OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
		I think this young man has avoided 
		the question completely. Has not 
		discussed "what happened" nor if 
		he's sorry for what he has done. 
		Therefore, I don't see any reason 
		why you should see him until he fully 
		discloses his intentions and feelings.

				  DEBI
		Thank you caller.

	Stabs another line.

				  DEBI
		You're on the air.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Are you there?

				  DEBI
		Yes.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		No, the guy.

	Martin looks up, humiliated.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah....

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Uh... when you guys use to go out... 
		Did you guys ever... heh heh heh 
		heh... ever fuckin', ever totally 
		fuckin' heh heh heh-

				  DEBI
		Next caller.

				  GUFF MAN VOICE
		I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad 
		gas to me. I would not allow him 
		access to your being.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  DEBI
		Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you 
		loud and clear: "If you love something 
		set it free. If it comes back to you 
		it's, well...

	She turns to him and shrugs apologetically.

				  DEBI
		...Broken...."

	Martin has his answer.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.

				  MARTIN
		Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

	He scans the main strip.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, 
	forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats 
	and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. 
	Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he 
	remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.

	FELIX'S P.O.V.

	As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, 
	and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches 
	their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that 
	they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His 
	P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark 
	sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet 
	away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...

	Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....

	THE MAN

	pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is 
	PAUL SWIDERSKI.

	MARTIN AND PAUL

	Martin relaxes.

				  PAUL
			(grinning ear-to-ear)
		Hell, I would've voted for you, but 
		there's all this apple sauce stuck 
		in my phone... I don't wanna talk 
		about it. How the hell are you?!
			(extends his hand)
		Here's five good ones!

	No trace of recognition on Martin's face.

				  PAUL
		Marty! It's me. Paul.

				  MARTIN
			(realizing)
		Paul?

				  PAUL
			(re: hand)
		You're leaving me hanging here...

	They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the 
	respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.

				  PAUL
		Hey. Give me a break.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY

	Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide 
	streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on 
	golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly 
	Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a 
	joint.

				  PAUL
		This won't take but a minute. I just 
		gotta hold their hands for a final 
		walk-through. I'll take them in, get 
		'em out, then you and I can grab a 
		little quality time.

	Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.

				  PAUL
		Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was 
		afraid you joined a cult or something. 
		I half-expected you to come back to 
		town in a fennel wreath and paper 
		pants.

	Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.

				  MARTIN
		There was no money in it.

	Martin regards Paul archly.

				  MARTIN
			(grinning)
		So what happened to you?

				  PAUL
		Same thing that happened to you-- I 
		stopped poutin' there on the 
		sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.  
		I joined the working week, you slick 
		fucking asshole, so why don't you 
		valet park your high horse and take 
		it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

				  MARTIN
		Fair enough.

	Beat.

				  PAUL
		God it's great to see you.

				  MARTIN
		You too.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized 
	Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were 
	different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is 
	hawking the house to them out of earshot.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
		Well, we do what we have to do if we 
		find you on the property. But we 
		don't really enforce the law, we 
		execute company policy for homeowners.

	MARTIN AND THE GUARD

	standing in the driveway.

				  MARTIN
		So when are you authorized to use 
		deadly force?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, a 'course, taxes provide your 
		basic service-- police and whatnot. 
		But our customers need a little more 
		than just that, you understand? This 
		badge doesn't mean that I am a peace 
		officer.

	The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.

				  MARTIN
		So it's not a meaningful symbol, or 
		anything. That badge is just the 
		badge of your company. If I look 
		suspicious on your customers' property--
		well, under those heightened 
		circumstances you have the authority 
		to, ah... To shoot me.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		To shoot you. Correct.

				  MARTIN
		How did you get this job?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, they were hiring, and it was 
		only a two week course...

				  MARTIN
			(pleasantly)
		Wow.

	Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.

				  PAUL
			(to couple)
		...What more can I say.

				  HUSBAND
			(smiling)
		We'll talk soon.

				  PAUL
			(much hand gesturing)
		You'll be raising your new family in 
		a work of art. A work of art in a 
		work of art.

	Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the 
	sell.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		I'm sure you'll be very happy.

	All look to Martin....

				  MARTIN
			(heartfelt)
		When my time comes, if it ever does, 
		I want a beautiful, normal place 
		like this... and a wife like you...

	All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

				  MARTIN
		...and you'll be safe here...

	Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE

	Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house 
	in the distance.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER

	Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming 
	neighborhood.

				  PAUL
		Now. I don't make a habit of pimping 
		my friends, but there is one prime 
		little piece of land that you must 
		see...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and 
	winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the 
	house.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi's house.

				  PAUL (V.O.)
		Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

	C.U. OF MARTIN

				  MARTIN
		No. You drove us here.

				  PAUL
		Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, 
		isn't it?

				  MARTIN
		No.

	Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of the mansion.

	They roll slowly by Debi's house.

	They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to 
	the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

				  PAUL
		Ten years. What happened!?

				  MARTIN
		I freaked out, joined the Army, worked 
		for the government, and went into 
		business for myself... I'm a 
		professional killer.

				  PAUL
		Thank you.

	Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

				  PAUL
		Professional killer, huh? Does that 
		come with a good HMO?

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The 
	sign above it says

		  "DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

				  MARTIN
			(looking ahead)
		He sells BMW's?

				  PAUL
		He sold me this bad boy.

				  MARTIN
		How could you put your hard-earned 
		dollars into the hands of the class 
		bully?

				  PAUL
		He gave me a great deal.

				  MARTIN
		Mein Dealer.

	Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
	looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing 
	up amidst his stable of expensive cars.

				  PAUL
		Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

				  BOB
			(dismissive)
		Glad to hear it.

	Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.

				  MARTIN
			(shouts)
		Bob...

				  BOB
			(turning)
		What?

				  MARTIN
		It's me. Martin Blank.

				  BOB
		Really...? So what?

				  MARTIN
		Okay. See you later.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward 
	his own. Paul calls after him.

				  PAUL
		See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
		a-man-made-good party.

	Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.

	MARTIN

	stands across the street from the radio station, looking at 
	Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from 
	his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE

	of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the 
	beat of an unheard song.

	MARTIN

	dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.

	INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

	Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at 
	his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban 
	teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video 
	game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still 
	working the double, nods to Martin.

				  CARL
		Can I help you?

				  MARTIN
		What's done is done.

	Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a 
	pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the 
	counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into 
	a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
	bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

	FELIX

	Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.

	MARTIN

	grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom 
	of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.

	CARL

	grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his 
	hands up.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Plays on.

	FELIX AND CARL

	Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward

	MARTIN

	Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking 
	out each freezer door behind him.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped 
	store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the 
	counter, sending Martin diving out of view.

	MARTIN

	pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now 
	two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on 
	Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, 
	spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can 
	take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's 
	left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.

	Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious 
	to the surrounding carnage.

	CASHIER ISLAND

	Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves 
	to Carl.

	CARL

	is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and 
	finds

	A BOMB

	under the corpse.

	MARTIN

	Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the 
	counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the 
	Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--

				  SKATEBOARDER
		What the fuck, man?!

	The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. 
	The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of 
	the double doors.

	EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

	The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is 
	peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive 
	and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb 
	and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi 
	looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking 
	Heads plays in the studio.

				  MARTIN
		Are you going to the reunion?

				  DEBI
		No. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
		here?

				  MARTIN
		That's part of it.

				  DEBI
		Well, you'll have a ball. You seem 
		to have everything everybody wants 
		when they go back. The car, the suit, 
		the watch. The look. That just leaves 
		the little things, like happiness, 
		character, point of view...

				  MARTIN
		It's always the little things.

				  DEBI
		Yep.

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		I'm wondering how you've been. How 
		you are. I'd like to catch up with 
		you. If it's possible.

	Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

				  MARTIN
		Well, there's not much to tell.

				  DEBI
		I'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
		in the last ten years. You've had 
		experiences.

				  MARTIN
		Bad experiences.

				  DEBI
		You met people.

				  MARTIN
		Bad people.

				  DEBI
		Watched television?

				  MARTIN
		Bad television.

				  DEBI
			(amused)
		Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
		sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

				  MARTIN
		What's that?

				  DEBI
		It's a swift spiritual kick to the 
		head that alters your reality forever.

				  MARTIN
		That'd be good.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		What do you want?

	The question is open.

				  MARTIN
		I figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
		around seven o'clock.

				  DEBI
		Let me get this straight, are you 
		asking me out?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Unbelievable.

				  MARTIN
		Seven it is.

				  DEBI
		I'll think about it.

	EXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

	Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
	a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
	Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
	s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
	her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
	boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
	finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
	the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
	Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

				  MONTY
		Baby, it's eight o'clock.

	Marcella gets up.

				  MARCELLA
		Thanks, Monty.

	She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

	INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

	Marcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

				  MARCELLA
		Hey there, how'd it go?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

	Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

				  MARTIN
		It isn't done.

	Marcella pauses, taking this in.

				  MARCELLA
		This is not good.

				  MARTIN
		I'll do it tomorrow.

	Marcella considers this.

				  MARCELLA
		What's it look like?

				  MARTIN
		It's fine.

				  MARCELLA
		You haven't looked at the dossier.

				  MARTIN
			(a little defensive)
		I've looked at it.

	Martin eyes the vent.

				  MARCELLA
		You have.

				  MARTIN
		Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
		remarkable about it at all.

				  MARCELLA
		I have to call the client and give 
		them a reason why you're late.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them my house exploded.

	Beat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

				  MARCELLA
		I'll call them and tell them you're 
		taking your time. Being a 
		professional.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
		you could find out why they double-
		booked the job, and who is trying to 
		kill me, and call me back-- that's 
		be great.

				  MARCELLA
		Will do.

	Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
	get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
	briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
	He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
	in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

	BRIEFCASE

	We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
	envelope and is about to tear the seal when

	THE PHONE RINGS

	Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

				  DEBI
			(filtered)
		Are you there?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Pick me up at my father's house at 
		around seven. And don't be late this 
		time.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		Hello...?

				  MARTIN
		This night, this reunion will be an 
		important step in our relationship.

				  DEBI
		You're fucking psycho.

				  MARTIN
		Don't rush to judgement until all 
		the facts are in.

	She hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
	turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

	GUNS, BULLETS, ETC.

	What has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
	to him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
	case to its hiding place.

	EXT. DINER - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
	across the street.

				  MCCULLERS
		I wish he'd do his job already so we 
		could do our job.

				  LARDNER
		We can't do our job unless he does 
		his job.

				  MCCULLERS
		Why don't we just do his job then, 
		so we can do our job, and get the 
		fuck out of here.

				  LARDNER
		Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
		killer.

				  MCCULLERS
		Wait a minute--

				  LARDNER
		-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
		but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
		a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
		then you come in and kill the Bad 
		Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

				  MCCULLERS
		So if we do his job, we're the bad 
		guys. If we do our job, we're the 
		good guys.

				  LARDNER
		Yup.

	They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
	caught short by the sight of

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV

				  GROCER
		moving into the diner.

	INT. DINER - LATE MORNING

	Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
	into an apple juice and looking out the window.

	GROCER

	slides into the booth, across from Martin.

	MARTIN AND GROCER

	Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
	levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
	drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
	breakfast stand-off.

				  GROCER
		Easy, tiger.

	A waitress approaches.

				  WAITRESS
		Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
		name is Melanie and I'll be your 
		server this morning. Let me tell you 
		about some of our specials. Today we 
		have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
		feature omelette. And there's our 
		"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
		you're in the mood for something 
		different there's the "I left my 
		heart in San Franchezie."

	Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

				  GROCER
		I want two eggs poached, hash brown 
		well-done. English muffin for the 
		bread. And a coffee.

				  MARTIN
		Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
		white omelette.

				  WAITRESS
		What would you like in the omelette?

				  MARTIN
		Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
		all.

	The waitress nods pertly and leaves.

				  GROCER
			(re: the omelette)
		Come on, live a little. I'm sorry 
		about the incident yesterday.

				  MARTIN
		No harm no foul.

				  GROCER
		A little misunderstanding among my 
		associates.

	Beat.

				  GROCER
		I told them to kill you and they 
		didn't.

				  MARTIN
		Hard to get good help these days.

				  GROCER
		But since we're both here, I think 
		it's time to take a fresh look at 
		our relationship.

				  MARTIN
		I didn't get into this business to 
		have "associates." And I don't want 
		to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
		" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
		own." That's the whole point. Why 
		don't you become a cop, or something. 
		You can drink coffee in the morning... 
		with friends!

	Grocer looks a little hurt.

				  MARTIN
			(easing up)
		Look, this is a one-on-one business... 
		Every time you get to know people, 
		bad things happen. If it'll make you 
		feel any better, this is my last 
		job. So what do you say we put our 
		guns away and forget the whole damn 
		thing.

	Grocer loses it.

				  GROCER
		Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
		everything's regulated!

	Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

				  MARTIN
		No deal.

				  GROCER
		Fine. But we're not going to let you 
		do your job. Because we're gonna do 
		it. And then, after we do your job, 
		we're gonna do another little job...

				  MARTIN
			(Wry)
		Is that right?

				  GROCER
		Yeah-- after I shoot you through the 
		fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
		in the bullethole.

				  MARTIN
		Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

	INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
	it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
	a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

				  MARTIN
			(trying on smile)
		Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
		couch insurance. I test-market 
		positive thinking. I lead a weekend 
		men's group, actually. We specialize 
		in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
		you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
			(sarcastic)
		Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
		I'm not married, I have no kids and 
		I'd blow your brains out if someone 
		paid me enough... So how've you been? 
		Where do you stand on The Issues? 
		Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
		shamed, blahblahblahblah--

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

	Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
	holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
	steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

				  DEBI
		Flowers. That's funny.

				  MARTIN
		As long as I get the laugh.

				  DEBI
			(taking them)
		Here. Let me put these in some rubbing 
		alcohol.

	She backs into the house, and he follows.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this 
	atavistic ritual.

				  MARTIN
		You look beautiful.

				  DEBI
		Okay... Hold on...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
	MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
	Barcolounger.

				  DEBI (V.O.)
		...Let me get my coat.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

	DEBI

	moves up the stairs and disappears.

	MARTIN

	looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
	den.

	INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

	Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
	He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
	hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
	Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Good evening, Mr. Blank.

				  MARTIN
		How are you? How's business?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Martin, I don't know where you've 
		been since you abandoned my daughter 
		ten years ago, and I don't care. It 
		was good that you left, and I'm glad 
		you did. So what do you want to talk 
		about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
		I had you figured wrong.

				  MARTIN
		How's that?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		I visualized you, in a haze, as one 
		of the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
		coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
		seeing in Newsweek.

				  MARTIN
		I took the other road. I'm more of a 
		self-reflective young lion who does 
		business with lead-pipe cruelty and 
		goes home to drink light beer in 
		milky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
		and sex and have no real relationships 
		with anyone. And you?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
		same old sell-out baby-boomer, 
		exploiting the oppressed I got shot 
		for at Kent State. But why don't we 
		have a drink and forget the whole 
		thing?

	Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

				  MARTIN
		Why not?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		So what are you doing with your life 
		now, son?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		That's good.

	Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

				  DEBI (O.S.)
		Okay

	Mr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE

	Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.

	INT. CAR - DUSK

	Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
	Martin is a widening pool of quicksand.

				  MARTIN
		Do you want to get a drink first?

				  DEBI
		I think they'll probably have booze 
		there.

				  MARTIN
		Right.

	Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
	it tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
	a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just be a second.

	Debi nods, a little confused but going with it.

				  DEBI
		Okay...

	EXT. PAYPHONE - MINUTES LATER

	Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
	conversation.

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
		someone tried to kill me and the guy 
		in the middle got killed. So if I 
		see that guy again I'm definitely 
		going to kill him, but I won't kill 
		anyone else. Oh, except for the guy 
		I was sent here to kill. I don't 
		know...

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

	Oatman treats his patient.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What else? Say more.

				  MARTIN
		Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm 
		on my way to the reunion.

	In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the 
	station.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Okay. Repeat this after me.

				  MARTIN
		Out Loud?

	Martin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr. 
	Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back.

				  MARTIN
		...I am at home with the me. I am 
		rooted in me, who is on this 
		adventure.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Take a deep breath and realize, that 
		this is me breathing.

				  MARTIN
		This is me breating.

	Martin takes in a few breaths.

				  MARITN
		Alright, look. I gotta go.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And don't kill anyone.

				  MARTIN
		Right. Don't kill anyone...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Felix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the

	NIGHTSTAND

	The reunion invite.

	FELIX

	picks it up and scans it.

	EXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

	Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch 
	Martin and Debi pull into a space.

				  LARDNER
		He's falling for her. Look at him.

				  MCCULLERS
		He using her.

				  LARDNER
		You're wrong. Look at his face.

				  MCCULLERS
		One cannot love and kill.

				  LARDNER
			(defensive)
		I love. I kill.

	MARTIN AND DEBI

	climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
	his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
	himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		Shoulda brought my gun.

				  DEBI
		What?

	He pulls himself off the car and heads toward

	GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL

	A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
	is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
	A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
	nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
	and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

				  ARLENE
		Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
		Joseph.

				  MARTIN
		I'm Martin Blank.

				  DEBI
		Debi Newberry.

	Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
	Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
	say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

				  ARLENE
		Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

				  MARTIN
		Don't say that.

	Arlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
	have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
	uncomfortably.

				  ARLENE
		We had pictures put on, that way 
		everybody knows who everybody was!

				  MARTIN
		Wonderful.

				  ARLENE
		So, what are you doing now?

				  MARTIN
		Whatever I can get away with.

	She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
	next arrival. Martin moves off...

				  ARLENE
			(to the next person)
		Isn't it cute. It's so everybody 
		knows who everybody was!

	He circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
	stops at the open bar.

				  BATENDER
		What can I make you?

				  MARTIN
		Beer.

	The bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
	the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Ken. How have you been?

				  KEN
			(glancing at Martin's 
			name tag)
		Hello Martin. How have you been?

				  MARTIN
		Not bad. You?

	Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
	contact is made.

				  KEN
		Hello, Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Bob.

	Bob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
	conversation.

				  KEN
		I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
		& Fromeyer.

				  MARTIN
		That sounds pretty interesting...

	Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

				  KEN
		Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
		Some property. Some personal injury.

				  MARTIN
		Those all seem kind of related...

	Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
	go.

				  MARTIN
		Tragedy makes you thirsty.

	Ken chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
	grabs it and begins to move off.

				  MARTIN
		Well... I have to take this over to 
		Debi.

				  KEN
		Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
		here's a special one. For top-shelf 
		clients.

	Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
	business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
	puts it in his kerchief pocket.

				  MARTIN
		Thanks.

	Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

	MARTIN

	makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
	emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
	Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
	Martin.

				  TERRY
		I don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
		people, driving me crazy. Look at 
		them over there, memorializing old 
		times, acting all like it was 
		something "life-changing." And the 
		people in the National Honor Society? 
		The name tags?

	Martin shrugs.

				  TERRY
		They have special blue starts on 
		them like it fucking matters now 
		that they were in the honor club ten 
		years ago. I'm getting fucking 
		nauseous from all this sentimental 
		bullshit. It's making me sick.

	Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
	man's nametag.

				  MARTIN
		Why are you here... Terry?

	Terry turns on a dime.

				  TERRY
		I wanted to see a couple people. But 
		I don't want to talk about the old 
		days... What did we have together, 
		Martin? Typing?

				  MARTIN
			(remembering)
		Drafting.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking 
		class. But I appreciate you helping 
		me out, man.

				  MARTIN
		Don't mention it.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try 
		and get out of here, man. I'll see 
		you later.

	Terry slinks off.

	BAR - SAME

	Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
	to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
	KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

				  DAN
		Bob. Bob Destephano.

				  BOB
		What?

				  DAN
		I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

				  BOB
		Computer guy.

				  DAN
		Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's 
		dealership the other day.

				  BOB
		I sell BMW's. What do you do?

				  DAN
		Not much, actually. My software 
		company just went public so I'm 
		just... hanging out, really.

	There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his 
	drunken hand at relating...

				  BOB
		Remember high school?

				  DAN
		Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us 
		up in the grandstands?

	Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks 
	off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.

	INT. GYM - LATER

	Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
	in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
	arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
	is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
	out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
	Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
	stop sports conversation.

				  MIKE
		...You gotta hold the fans 
		responsible, though, Dennis, because 
		they're the ones putting up with the 
		mediocre product.

				  DENNIS
		I guess, though, you know, if you 
		look at it Mike, that park is a 
		beautiful park, I've gone to that 
		park many times - I've had the 
		greatest time of my life at that 
		ballpark and let's face it, I tell 
		you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, 
		if you're having the fun you should 
		be having at Tigers Stadium, you 
		don't even know what the hell's going 
		on anyway...

	They both crack up at this.

	ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI

				  DARIUS
		Have you two been together since 
		high school?

				  DEBI
		No--

				  MARTIN
		--Yes. Actually we just bought that 
		little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine 
		Avenue... Debi's a social worker and 
		I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

				  DEBI
		We haven't seen each other since 
		high school.

				  DARIUS
		I figured. You two look too happy 
		together. I shouldn't say that though, 
		I'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
		you up to these days? What do you do 
		for a living?

	Debi perks up; this should be interesting.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in pro-active international 
		relations. It's a very specialized 
		company. We execute economic 
		investment opportunities. Sort of 
		economic clean-up... with an emphasis 
		on personnel. It's boring, you know, 
		it's boring. I don't like to talk 
		about it because I don't think what 
		a man does necessarily reflects who 
		he is...

	Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
	Martin may be in trouble.

				  MARTIN
		...I've always tried to refrain from 
		a black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
		know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
		been more interested in the gray 
		areas.

	Silence. Martin pushes on.

				  MARTIN
		But that's no way to live. I guess 
		you've got to just take the leap of 
		faith. Believe in something. Fuck 
		it.

				  DARIUS
		Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you 
		happy?

				  MARTIN
		I just have to close this one last 
		account. I'd like to just stop now, 
		today, but I can't... It's a step in 
		the right direction.

				  DEBI
		I don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
		you're feeling compromised. Live the 
		way you want. The only thing that's 
		inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
		That's the biggest cop-out there is.

	Nods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
	and then...

				  AMY
		But wait. I still don't understand 
		what you do.

				  MARTIN
		I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

	Debi suppresses a laugh.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		Yes I do.

				  AMY
		You don't...

				  MARTIN
		In the corporate offices.

				  AMY
		Oh... really?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  AMY
		What do you do?

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits to the Southland.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		It's what I do.

				  AMY
		You're so funny...

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits and gravy all over 
		the Southland--

				  AMY
		--Stop it--

				  MARTIN
		You know those horsey biscuit gravy 
		packets? I move all of those--

				  AMY
		--No.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's 
		and just change them to special 
		barbecue sauce.

	Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

				  DENNIS
		What do you think about black coaching 
		in the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
		it's great.

				  DARIUS
		I don't pay much attention to 
		football.

				  MIKE
		I have to agree with you Dennis. 
		It's good to see that the owners are 
		willing to put the franchise behind 
		a black head coach or QB when for 
		years in the league they've been 
		kept out of the thinking positions 
		and relegated mainly to the physical 
		game.

				  DENNIS
		But now, you see, you have Warren 
		Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art 
		Shell, and the coach up at 
		Minnesota...

				  MIKE
		Dennis Green. And if you remember, 
		Doug Williams was the first black 
		man to prove that on a Superbowl 
		Sunday.

	Amy leans in to Martin.

				  AMY
			(to Martin)
		I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior 
		High School.

				  DENNIS
		...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand 
		on this whole Louis Farrakhan 
		issue...?

				  DARIUS
			(facetious)
		I'm a De Klerk man myself.

	Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.

				  DEBI
		I'm going over to play some tunes.

	Martin watches her walk away.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - LATER

	Dan Koretzky sits with two other FORMER-SQUARES-turned-
	handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with 
	early investment in Microsoft.

	Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. 
	He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back.

	GROUP OF MEN

				  DAN
		Look at her. There it is. Jenny 
		Slater. The finest thing that ever 
		walked these halls.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		I believe she married the state of 
		Maine.

				  DAN
		Yeah, he's around here somewhere. 
		What a shame. She would have looked 
		great in my fucking Bentley.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only 
		was she as fine, if not finer, than 
		Slater, but she had the "bad girl" 
		thing going for her. And the red 
		hair. C'mon.

				  DAN
		She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti 
		was the finest. No question about 
		it.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. 
		All named Jenny...

				  DAN
		You know what I'm really hoping? 
		That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And 
		she's twenty-eight--

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		--she's got half the state of Maine--

				  DAN
		She's twenty-eight years old, with 
		two kids, she's still really really 
		fine, and I see her at a bookstore 
		or something, and she sees me for 
		what I was then, and what I am now: 
		the redemption for all her failure.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		You mean the redemption for all your 
		failure.

	They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating 
	on Debi.

	BOB DESTEPHANO

	Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER

	Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay 
	booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric 
	game.

				  DEBI
		Which would you rather...?

				  MARTIN
		Okay... Would you rather... commit 
		yourself sexually to a four-by-nine 
		cell with former President George 
		Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a 
		super-model for a month, or make 
		love to a otter on crank for a week?

				  DEBI
		Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, 
		clearly! I'd let the little beast 
		scratch and claw all he wants... 
		Okay. Would you rather make love to 
		the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

				  MARTIN
		--She's not dead---

				  DEBI
		It's just a game...! Alright. Candied 
		Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest 
		across the desert with a fully 
		digested crab apple in your mouth?

				  MARTIN
		Wow. I have to give this some thought.

				  DEBI
		No time.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

	STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified 
	and unsure at what she's heard.

				  STACEY
		Marty! Debi! How are you! So many 
		people came, but I never expected to 
		see you Marty. Or you Debi... I 
		mean... because of what your 
		divorce... I didn't mean to say that. 
		I just meant you look so good.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  STACEY
		Do you think you could play "Too 
		Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

				  DEBI
		Stacey, why don't you come up here 
		and take over for a little while?

				  STACEY
		I'd love to.

	Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as 
	Martin and Debi make their way down.

				  DEBI
			(to Martin)
		Everybody thinks they know me now 
		that I'm divorced.

	She leads Martin toward the exit.

				  DEBI
		It's time to see you in private.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together.

				  MARTIN
		Even though I left, you never left 
		me. Not just memory but a substance 
		in my blood.

				  DEBI
			(smiling)
		Like heroin?

				  MARTIN
		Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

				  DEBI
			(enjoying this)
		Like love?

				  MARTIN
		Could be. The physical substance of 
		love.

	Debi stops.

				  DEBI
		I'll accept that. Follow me.

	Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, 
	and close the door behind them.

	INT. NURSE'S OFFICE

	Martin and Debi make wild banshee love.

	EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.

				  MCCULLERS
		Looks like someone keeps trying to 
		do our job for us.

				  LARDNER
		If he does our job, he's our job.

				  MCCULLERS
		I get it.

	INT. GYM - SAME

	FELIX

	steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into 
	the crowded gym. He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer 
	combo, with no nametag. He's clearly too old for the class 
	of 1984.

	INT. HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-
	coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't 
	You Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
	tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
	that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
	Martin, something must be done about it.

				  DEBI
		I'll be right back....

	Debi kisses him. They split up. Martin walks off, the happiest 
	we've seen him....

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a 
	drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal 
	that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite 
	a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
	from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
	continuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
	Martin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
	the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
	classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
	echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
	gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
	back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
	ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
	and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
	holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
	grinds it into dust in his hand.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music 
	changed for the better.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Martin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
	Destephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
	slightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
	leans into Martin

				  BOB
		So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that 
		shit again?

				  MARTIN
		Fine, Bob. How are you?

				  BOB
		Never better.

				  MARTIN
		Really?

	Bob crumbles.

				  BOB
		Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing 
		adds up to nothing... you work your 
		whole life, day in and day out-- try 
		to make sense of it all. One day 
		you're twenty-seven and what do you 
		get to show for it...

				  MARTIN
		You could've been a contender, huh?

	Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without 
	the use of cliches.

				  BOB
		Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how 
		smart you are with my foot up your 
		ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

	Martin steps to Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Why would you want to hit me, Bob? 
		Do you really believe that there's 
		some stored up conflict that needs 
		resolution between us? We don't exist. 
		There's nothing between us. So who 
		do you want to hit, Bob? It's not 
		me.

	Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated.

				  BOB
		What am I gonna do?

				  MARTIN
		What do you want to do?

				  BOB
		I want to be an actor.

				  MARTIN
		Then express yourself, Bob.

	Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself.

				  MARTIN
			(catching him)
		Be honest...

	Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, 
	then stops abruptly, and smiles.

				  BOB
		Later, Martin.

	Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin 
	watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the 
	doors of a stairwell, disappearing.

	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the 
	stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her 
	but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
	quickens her pace up the stairs...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
	relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
	from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
	a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
	withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
	the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
	his attacker--

	FELIX

	impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
	of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
	stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
	sound. His eyes lock onto

	DEBI

	who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees.

	MARTIN

	looks back at

	FELIX

	Dead.

	THE FLOOR

	A growing pool of blood.

	MARTIN

	Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. 
	Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming

		 "SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

	MARTIN

	rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
	Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
	shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over 
	each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. 
	He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
	hall, and bangs through the doors.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands 
	looking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found. He scans 
	the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the 
	one in Oatman's office. In the middle of the floor, Terry 
	slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes.

	MARTIN

	pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall.

	INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it 
	over his shoulder.

	INT. STAIRWELL - A MINUTE LATER

	Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow. Martin bounds down the 
	steep steps with his load.

	INT. BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM HALLWAY - MINUTE LATER

	Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him. He kicks 
	through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on 
	casters and begins rolling.

	INT. PUMP AND FURNACE ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

	The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind 
	Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops 
	next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses 
	and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses 
	into the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar 
	and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace. A 
	white-hot blaze roars within.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	The party is winding down. A harried-looking Martin walks in 
	and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing.

	MARTIN'S POV

	of the Deejay booth. It is empty.

	He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge. He motions 
	to the bartender who opens a beer for him.

				  MARTIN
		Have you seen Debi Newberry?

				  KEN
		Nope.

	They both look around at the last of the reunion.

				  KEN
		The more things change, the more 
		they Goddamned well stay the same.

				  MARTIN
		I guess.

	Before Ken can get started again...

				  MARTIN
		Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks 
		for the pen.

	Martin walks out of the gym.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

	Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.

				  PAUL
		What the hell happened to you?

				  MARTIN
		I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

				  PAUL
		As long as you had a good time.

	Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.

				  PAUL
		What now? Chase the girl?

	There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.

				  MARTIN
		It didn't work out.

				  PAUL
		That's too bad.

				  MARTIN
		I have to get my head back into my 
		work.

				  PAUL
		Work's good for the soul.

	Martin gets up to leave.

				  MARTIN
		When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

				  PAUL
		See you in ten years.

	Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better 
	of it.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT

	Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.

	MARTIN PULLS

	THE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the 
	contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and 
	dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock.

				  MARTIN
		Dumb fucking luck...

	THE CONTENTS

	include various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with 
	Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official-
	looking papers including credit reports, medical records, 
	etc... Newberry's life.

	He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
	He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
	toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
	body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
	gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
	door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

	Debi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm.

				  DEBI
		He was trying to kill you, right!

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Not the other way around...?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DEBI
		Is it something you've done?

				  MARTIN
		It's something I do...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...Professionally...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...About five years now.

				  DEBI
			(stunned)
		Get the fuck outta here.

				  MARTIN
		Seriously, when I left, I joined the 
		Army and took the service exam. They 
		found my psych results fit a certain 
		profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" 
		would be the best way to describe 
		it... I was loaned out to a CIA-
		sponsored program. It's called 
		"mechanical operations." We sort of 
		found each other...

				  DEBI
		You're a government spook?

	Martin says nothing.

				  MARTIN
		I was, but no... yes... I was before, 
		but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, 
		really. The idea of governments, 
		nations, it's mostly a public 
		relations theory at this point, 
		anyway. But I'll tell you something, 
		until about five months ago, I really 
		enjoyed my work.

				  DEBI
		Jesus Christ!

				  MARTIN
		Then I started losing my taste for 
		it. Which usually means your time is 
		up. But then I realized it was 
		something entirely different... I 
		started getting the sneaking, dark 
		suspicion that maybe there was... 
		meaning to life.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Great, Martin, that's just 
		great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

				  MARTIN
		Like, that there's a point? An organic 
		connection between all living things.

				  DEBI
		Let me help you along, Martin. You're 
		a sociopath!

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		A sociopath kills for no reason. I 
		kill for money.

				  DEBI
		You never could have kept this from 
		me.

				  MARTIN
		I was leaving.

				  DEBI
		That's probably a good idea.

				  MARTIN
		Will you come with me?

				  DEBI
		I'm staying here.

				  MARTIN
		What if I come back?

				  DEBI
		I'll hide.

	She goes for the door.

				  MARTIN
		Don't go.

	She stops at the door. Slowly, she turns.

				  DEBI
		You don't get to have me. You are a 
		monster, I'm a human being. We're 
		not going to mate.

				  MARTIN
		You don't understand...

				  DEBI
		That's because I speak human, and 
		you speak monster.

	Debi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone.

	Martin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he 
	walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a 
	cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently 
	singing to himself...

				  MARTIN
		"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's 
		up Doc, are you lookin'...?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN

	Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking 
	up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the 
	bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, 
	checking their bores and actions...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING

	Lardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the 
	last of many clips...

	EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING

	Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off 
	onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. 
	They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin 
	loading...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and 
	knock the slides...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. 
	He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops 
	and looks himself in the mirror before exiting.

	EXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT

	Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...

	INT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT

	Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
	and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
	pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of 
	paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of 
	"Women Who Run With the Wolves."

				  MARCELLA
		I'm bringing down the office now.

	She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. 
	It's cathartic.

	INTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR -

				  MARTIN
		I'll put things right. Then I'll 
		find you.

	Silence on the line.

				  MARCELLA
			(apprehensive)
		Uh... why?

	Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier.

				  MARTIN
		Don't worry. I left you a little 
		something under your desk.

	Martin hangs up.

	Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink-
	wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so.

				  MARCELLA
		All right!!

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR

	Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the 
	distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, 
	away from him.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching 
	Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares 
	to blow Newberry's head off.

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME

	As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, 
	he accelerates.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry.

				  GROCER
		Oh shit...

	EXT. ROAD - SAME

	Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing 
	down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.

	INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

	Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
	the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
	swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
	to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
	Newberry opens the passenger door.

				  NEWBERRY
		What the fuck is the matter with 
		you?!

				  MARTIN
		Well, I was hired to kill you. It's 
		what I do, and come to think of it, 
		I told you that, but... Okay. I'm 
		not going to do it. Get in the car.

	He does. They drive on.

				  MARTIN
		It's either because I'm in love with 
		your daughter, or because I have a 
		new-found respect for life. Or both. 
		But I don't know.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and company watch in amazement.

	GROCER'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded 
	driveway.

				  GROCER
		That punk is either in love with 
		that guy's daughter or he has new 
		found respect for life... Let's go.

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
	and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
	shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

				  NEWBERRY
		Why? I build cars! They're paying 
		you to kill me? Why?

				  MARTIN
		It was a cost-cutting effort. They 
		can't afford a recall.

				  NEWBERRY
		It was a leaky sunroof! A design 
		flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! 
		You want to kill me because of that?

				  MARTIN
		It's not me! Why does everybody think 
		it's personal?!

	They go through the front door and shut it behind them.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within 
	viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into 
	the driveway.

				  LARDNER
		We'll go in through the woods.

	INT. NEWBERRY HOUSE

	Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
	contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
	Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
	Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
	Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was sitting in my house on prom 
		night wearing that Goddamned rented 
		tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
		bottle of champagne in the other. So 
		I was just sitting there, and then 
		the whole night flashed before my 
		eyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
		in the head-- I realized, finally, 
		and for the first time, that... I 
		wanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
		because I loved you so much, that'd 
		it'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
		you anymore. But now I'm different.

	He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
	shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
	door.

	Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
	Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
	Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
	Debi. They stop at what they see:

	NEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.

	As ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
	Martin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
	kit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
	their guns rising up fast toward us.

	Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
	it. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
	outside.

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
	A barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
	back behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
	comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
	the cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

				  MARTIN
		I'm in love with you. I know we can 
		make this work!

	MARTIN

	rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
	range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
	steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
	SHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
	the Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
	kitchen.

	NEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH

	Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
	is beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
	at Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was afraid to commit to a 
		relationship, but now I know I'm 
		ready to make it happen.

	Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
	be the wrists.

				  MARTIN
		I just need time to change.

	He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
	stairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
	another ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

	HALLWAY

	He leads them quickly.

				  MARTIN
		It's not easy for me. I was raised 
		to close off, to control my 
		feelings...

	He takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
	coming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
	Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
	through the doorway.

				  MARTIN
		Lock the door.

	They do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
	straight.

				  MARTIN
		I wasn't raised in a loving 
		environment.
			(beat)
		But that's not an excuse. It's a 
		reason.

	INT. FOYER

	Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
	stairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

				  MARTIN
		My soul was empty--

	Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
	Grocer beginning to slip in.

				  MARTIN
		--and it's up to me to fill it.

	Martin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
	slide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
	hears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
	tossing the spent weapon.

	INT. BEDROOM

	An ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
	Debi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
	The Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
	the line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
	Assassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

				  MARTIN
			(through the door)
		It's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
		to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

				  MARTIN
		I know what I do isn't moral, per 
		se, but if you could just look past 
		that, you'd see a man worth loving.

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		Don't listen to him, he's a 
		professional.

	Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
	voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		You're breaking my heart down here, 
		Blank. I can't shoot through the 
		tears.

	Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
	man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
	firefight...

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
	about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

				  LARDNER
		Did you see Blank in there?

				  MCCULLERS
		No...

				  LARDNER
		Good. For a second there I thought 
		we were in trouble.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	MARTIN

	reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
	up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
	FIRE, when they hear...

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
	ala Butch and Sundance.

	Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
	FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
	out of view.

	KITCHEN - INTERCUT

	GROCER

	heads up the back stairs.

	MARTIN

	works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
	kitchen.

	GROCER

	hears him and starts back down.

	Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
	out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
	Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
	crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
	air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
	room, still firing.

	C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION

	The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and 
	the slide on the auto locks back-- empty.

	NORMAL SPEED

	GROCER

	Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
	serving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
	that sits on a lazy susan.

	MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

	Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
	side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
	the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
	counter above and between them.

	Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

				  GROCER
		...How about I sell you two rounds 
		for a hundred grand a piece?

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

	Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
	into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

	BALLED CHECK

	sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
	Grocer's head and into his lap.

				  MARTIN
		There you go. I left it blank.

				  GROCER
		Excellent. Here they come.

	Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
	and pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
	BULLETS into the air.

	MARTIN

	rises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
	BULLETS sail past his head.

	GROCER

	begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
	gun.

	MARTIN

	puts all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
	and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

	GROCER

	gets off one round before

	MARTIN

	flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
	over his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
	landing on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

	GROCER

	Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
	picture tube. He is dead.

	MARTIN

	runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
	discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
	edge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
	his arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
	into the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

	MARTIN AND NEWBERRY

	MARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
	it into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
	Martin looks past Newberry.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	Of Debi, head in hands.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi... will you marry me?

	Debi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head 
	still down, and closes the bathroom door...

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Outside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, 
	bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...

				  DEBI
		This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry 
		cause that's what it does. Bringing 
		you New Ones for the Nineties, a 
		fresh new format designed to pull 
		you out of what's come before, and 
		reel you into what's coming soon--

	THE PHONE CONSOLE

	lights up with an incoming cal...

				  DEBI
		I tell you what's coming soon for 
		me, or at least what I dreamed this 
		morning in that weird time just before 
		you actually wake up. But first this 
		commercial. Back after this...

	She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, 
	and answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio 
	monitor:

				  ANNOUNCER
		Don't miss the show of the season at 
		Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" 
		A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," 
		starring Carol Plummer, Thomas 
		Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee 
		Ordman!...

	Debi picks up the phone.

				  DEBI
		RFN...

	Her face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... 
	Then she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of 
	dead air, then she snaps to.

				  DEBI
		Hey out there... Okay... I'm going 
		to finish up that fantasy later. 
		First I'll give you an hour of nonstop 
		music... If I don't come back on 
		after that-- well, nevermind.

	Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but 
	stops dead when she sees

	MARTIN

	sitting on the front steps.

	Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the 
	porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. 
	After a while...

				  DEBI
		This will never work out.

	She turns to him, serious.

				  DEBI
		You kill people.
			(beat)

				  MARTIN
		I have no illusions about the future. 
		What is, is. We make choices. And we 
		become the sum total of our choices. 
		I can live with that.

				  DEBI
		Other people can't.

	Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly. 
	She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same. 
	They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...

	FADE IN:

	ROLL CREDITS OVER:

	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN

	VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
	brilliant greens:

	A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

	pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
	soaked lawn.

	FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

	No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

	GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER

	At the bottom of a water hazard.

	PALM FRONDS

	After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
	surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
	air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
	Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
	palms to

	A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.

	Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
	moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
	it out. The trousers walk out after it.

	HANDS

	Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
	golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
	gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

	YELLOW TROUSERS

	In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
	journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
	putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
	rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
	and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
	and into the hole.

	THE GLOVED HAND

	Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
	golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
	bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
	out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
	The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
	firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
	face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
	squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

	We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
	him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
	another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
	rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
	One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
	could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

	MARTIN'S ARM

	Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
	later in the distance, the

	RED SWEATER'S HEAD

	Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
	body crumples to the green.

	MARTIN

	Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
	the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
	absently...

				  MARTIN
		Hooked it. 

	INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

	The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
	club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
	a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
	peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		I'd come to the realization that 
		everything I'd based my life on was 
		false. And that my life had no 
		meaning.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
			(to Martin)
		He gets this way when he hits over 
		eighty-five.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		It seemed like my life was slipping 
		away, somehow. I was a knot in the 
		middle of a wet rope. Everything was 
		futile and nothing had value.

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		That's the way life is. The only 
		meaning and value is what we create. 
		Through structure, and discipline. 
		Though they seem to limit our freedom, 
		they actually give us great comfort. 
		Your problem is you're looking for 
		some great answer. Some ultimate 
		truth. When what you really should 
		do is go to work and go home.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		And take golf lessons.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		That's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
		story please? I began my search for 
		meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
		Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
		went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
		herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
		and a psychic. And they all pretty 
		much say the same stuff.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
		telling you the same thing? You're 
		insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Basically the same thing. In a very 
		evolved, esoteric way.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		To make a long story short...

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		--Thank God--

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		...at last I found the holistic system 
		of systems that opened up the doors 
		of heaven for me right here on earth. 
		And everyday I see the world through 
		the eyes of a child. A world of 
		creation and wonder.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Jesus...

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Overflowing with love.

				  MARTIN
		Tell me about it.

	Club Member #1 turns to Martin.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
		secrets of your universe are divided 
		up into eight easily digestible 
		slices.

	Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
	hands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
	wail.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		See, see. It's in the accessible and 
		everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
		day you have a little slice of 
		peace...

	INSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD

	A pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

				  MARTIN
		Oh I see. You got your individual 
		slices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
		self-love, justice, and harmony.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		You open 'em up and there's the 
		sayings, stories, little bites of 
		insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
		Week.

				  MARTIN
		So you eat-- read it everyday?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		And these pan pizzas have opened up 
		the doors to heaven?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Correct.
			(re: the card)
		That's for you. Keep it.

	Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

	EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

	The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
	toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
	the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

				  MARTIN AT CAR
		He fishes out the laminated "Personal 
		Pan Power" card, looks at it, and 
		tosses it onto the ground. Police 
		cars, now visible in the distance,

		Martin gets into his car and pulls 
		away.

	LAMINATED CARD

	As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
	to a stop on it.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
	down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
	of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
	Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
	and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
	impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
	done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
	him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
	massively uploading the world around him:

	Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
	crouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
	supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
	in arm, smiling, etc.

	INT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY

	The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
	Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
	already begun.

				  DRIVER
		How was your day, today, sir?

				  MARTIN
		Effective. But to tell you the truth, 
		I've lost my passion for work.

				  DRIVER
		Do you like the people you work with?

				  MARTIN
		I work alone.

				  DRIVER
		That's it then. That's it. I've always 
		been alone. That's why I'm a good 
		driver. I can handle it. See, I can 
		think on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
		thinker. And I can sit there in front 
		of your house for two hours and it 
		don't bother me. Some people can't 
		do it! Some people are ranting and 
		raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
		get out here and get in this car, I 
		can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
		go? You're gonna wind up back in 
		your garage at seven o'clock at night. 
		You ain't going nowhere. You leave 
		your house in the morning you get 
		back to your house in the evening. 
		What's the big deal, right?

				  MARTIN
		You understand the psychology of the 
		job.

				  DRIVER
		I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
		they can't handle it.

	INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

	The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
	Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

				  DRIVER
		You look like you're far away. Far 
		away and thinking about other things. 
		I'm right about that, aren't I?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DRIVER
		Well, let's just say that sometimes 
		I'm right. Sometimes you are.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
		natural.

				  DRIVER
			(laughs to himself at 
			this great truth)
		It's only natural....

	The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

				  DRIVER
		I been looking at you, and I've 
		decided that I want to share something 
		with you.

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

				  DRIVER
		Because your problem is you're bored. 
		And you have a very big mind.
			(beat)
		I am part of what I call a brain 
		syndicate.

	No reaction from Martin.

				  DRIVER
		I am part of a network of minds, a 
		group of five people who are all 
		connected, over hundreds, even 
		thousands of miles, through the mind. 
		We can think with each other, think 
		for each other. I can be driving 
		somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
		whatever it is-- and at the same 
		time be thinking a thought in someone 
		else's mind, far away. Running someone 
		else's brain.

				  MARTIN
			(indicates)
		Up on the right.

				  DRIVER
		And when you think of it, it's not 
		so surprising that a small group of 
		people control the whole world, is 
		it?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
	East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
	watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
	the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
	it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
	to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
	depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
	a moment.

				  MARTIN
		If it's not there, I can't proceed. 
		Tell them.

	Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
	waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
	on the bed.

				  MARTIN
		Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
		I'm only in town tonight.

	He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
	metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
	silencer.

				  MARTIN
		What's different this time than the 
		last time? I have to be down front...

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

	Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
	scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
	across the arm of a chair.

				  MARTIN
		...I don't bother to call anyone 
		else because you always take care of 
		me.

	He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
	a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
	scope and sees

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

	A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
	is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
	gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
	his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
	hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

				  MARTIN
		Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
		full here.

	He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
	the messenger.

				  MARTIN
		Good. Account number 3649367, transfer 
		to account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
		Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
		Mr. Duckman. If there are any 
		problems, access file 673594638-IO-
		98, and look at it.

	Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
	rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
	high-rise.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1

	Of a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
	suits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
	man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
	Saville Row finery.

	MARTIN

	Takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
	the rifle toward Window #2.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2

	of an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

	MARTIN

	concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
	left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
	between Window #2 and Window #1.

	STREET

	the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
	a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
	just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
	Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
	two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
	a parked car in front of them.

	MARTIN

	withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
	begins to break down the rifle.

				  MARTIN
		Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
		playoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
		thousand dollars for one seat...

	Martin listens patiently as he works.

	EXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT

	DOORMAN'S HANDS

	unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

	MARTIN

	just finishes packing.

				  MARTIN
		...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
		I have to do to get courtside tickets 
		for the Knicks...?

	STREET

	The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
	two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
	Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

	DOORMAN

	a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
	handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
	flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
	Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

	MARTIN

	is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

				  MARTIN
		Never mind. I gotta go.

	Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE

	of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
	He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
	FIRES both guns.

	MARTIN

	reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
	from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
	exit.

	HIGH-RISE FOYER

	Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
	bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
	makes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
	He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

	MARTIN

	his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
	and walks down the street.

	DOORMAN

	now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
	walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY

	Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
	on the cellular.

				  MARTIN
		...Tell them that's not my problem. 
		I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
		not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

				  MARCELLA
		Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

				  MARTIN
		Patch him through....

	Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
	recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
	GROCER.

				  MARTIN
		What do you want?

				  GROCER
		I'm setting up a concern that would 
		enable those of us in our rarefied 
		profession to consolidate our efforts.

				  MARTIN
		Like a union?

				  GROCER
		Like a club. Work less, make more.

				  MARTIN
		Thank you, no.

				  GROCER
		We could be working together, making 
		big money, killing important people... 
		I'm willing to let you in on the 
		ground floor.

				  MARTIN
		And you could be... sort of like... 
		a father figure to me....

	Grocer ignores this.

				  GROCER
		It's a free-market evolution. You'll 
		wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
		to run together when you were a 
		rookie. I don't want to run against 
		you. This thing's real. Everybody's 
		in.

				  MARTIN
		Not me. So don't paw at me with your 
		dirty little guild.

				  GROCER
		I'm gonna get you, kid.

	Martin hangs up and pulls away.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
	an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
	speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
	He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
	and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

	INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT

	Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
	drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
	the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
	bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
	them down with a reddish-orange beverage.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
	closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
	his chest.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
		been ten years? Where are you now...?

	After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
	the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

	CLOSE-UP: WIRE

	from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
	one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
	walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
	box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
		canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
		perhaps in charge of appearances for 
		the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
	and twice as long, by a string.

	VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER

	The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
	MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
	snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
	We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
	KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
	the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
	in the floor.

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
	thread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
	floor, his attention shifts to the

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
	make their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Could it be that you're like Chip 
		Longfellow, at the trade-relations 
		tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
		owns a cheese shop...!

	MARTIN

	adjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
	fiber-optic cable with the other.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
	the drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
	face...

	A DROP FALLS

	It misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
	CAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
	back up through the hole in the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
		evokes so many memories...!

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
			(hushed)
		Fuck!

	MARTIN

	stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
	of frame.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Some good. Some bad. But all 
		interesting...

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
	dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
	in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
	Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
	Bodyguard levels his at Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Freeze! Police!

	The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
	through the head.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...As a graduate of the class of 
		1984, you are someone special...

	Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
	key chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
	the door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
	him into the apartment.

	INT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

	Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
	the bedroom and slips across the threshold.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Whenever news of you filters back, 
		the school is excited and proud of 
		your accomplishments...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
	gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
	opens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
	returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
		you well to lead the kind of life 
		that makes an impact on the world...

	Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
	his barrel to the man's forehead.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Remember, "there's no where you 
		can go that you haven't learned how 
		to go in time... It's easy..."

				  HUSKY MAN
			(in severe pain)
		Whatever it is that I'm doing that 
		you don't like I'll stop doing it.

				  MARTIN
		It's not me.

	Martin cocks the gun....

	EXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY

	The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
	bungalows.

	INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY

	A small suite of dry-walled offices.

	EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY

	is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
	of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
	is MARCELLA MAYES.

				  MARCELLA
		...So come on back to the old oak 
		tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion 
		committee."

	Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
	the first time, Martin looks scared.

				  MARTIN
		Throw that away.

				  MARCELLA
		This?

				  MARTIN
		Don't tease me. You know what I do 
		for a living.

				  MARCELLA
		It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
		How was the trip?

				  MARTIN
		Tedious. I now authorize you to throw 
		away all personal mail.

				  MARCELLA
		All of it?

				  MARTIN
		And not show it to me. Ever again.

				  MARCELLA
		That's going to cost.

				  MARTIN
		I'll pay.

	Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
	stops him.

				  MARCELLA
		They're not happy, sir.

				  MARTIN
		I'm not happy.

				  MARCELLA
		They say their friend was suppose to 
		have a heart attack and die in his 
		sleep.

				  MARTIN
		He didn't.

				  MARCELLA
		They blame you for the compromise.

				  MARTIN
		And they want me to make up for it.

				  MARCELLA
		In Detroit. This weekend.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them that's impossible. I need 
		my normal lead time.

				  MARCELLA
		They were very upset.

				  MARTIN
		Would you describe their position as 
		inflexible?

				  MARCELLA
		Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

	Marcella looks concerned.

				  MARCELLA
		And sir, I also get that broken-
		mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
		thirteenth kind of feeling about 
		this one....

				  MARTIN
		There's nothing to be done about it.

				  MARCELLA
		I liquidated the last account in 
		Zurich, and split it into two new 
		ones in Estonia.

				  MARTIN
		Good. What else? Anything interesting?

				  MARCELLA
		Mmm, not really. But you're gonna 
		love this one.

	She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

				  MARCELLA
		Enough?

				  MARTIN
		Never enough.

				  MARCELLA
		But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
		so easy.

	Martin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
	shredder at the side of her desk.

				  MARTIN
		I have scruples. Next.

				  MARCELLA
		Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
		a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

	She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
	and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
	private office.

	MARTIN'S OFFICE

	Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
	walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
	holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
	manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
	books on import/export. He sits and stares.

	NEW ANGLE

	Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
	his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

	C.U. MARTIN'S TEETH

	The dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
	a hummingbird.

				  MARCELLA
			(off-screen)
		You should get going....

	MARTIN

	pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
	protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
	tweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

	FOYER

	Martin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
	him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

				  MARCELLA
		Don't forget your identity.

				  MARTIN
		See you next week.

	Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
	the envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
	out, over his shoulder...

				  MARTIN
		Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

	INT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Martin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
	envelope, now open.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Why don't you want to go to your 
		high school reunion?

				  MARTIN
		It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
		I have in common with those people? 
		Or with anyone?

	DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
	wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
	old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
	a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
	a tough question.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You went to school with these people.

				  MARTIN
		Come on.

				  DR. OATMAN
		We've spent a lot of time discussing 
		those years. Remember we said that 
		fear is a transfer of the bodily 
		hurt associated by experience with 
		the thing feared, to the thought of 
		the thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
		distinctly imagining its bite.

				  MARTIN
		Shouldn't you be taking notes?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Tell me about your vision of the 
		reunion.

	CLOSE-UP - MARTIN

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - FROM ABOVE

	Of a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
	doing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
	SIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
	DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
	OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
	OFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.

							   CUT BACK TO:

	MARTIN AND OATMAN

				  MARTIN
		It'll be depressing.

				  DR. OATMAN
		How do you know?

				  MARTIN
		I just know.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Say more.

				  MARTIN
		They'll have husbands and wives and 
		children and houses and dogs.... 
		made themselves a part of something. 
		And they can talk about what they 
		do. What am I going to say?
			(sarcastic)
		"I killed the President of Paraguay 
		with a fork."

	Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You needn't be so frank with me about 
		your work.

				  MARTIN
		Why not. I trust you. You couldn't 
		turn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
		privilege... and I don't want to be 
		"withholding"... and I know where 
		you live.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You know where I live?

				  MARTIN
		We're both professionals, Oatman.

				  DR. OATMAN
		I think what you fear Martin is 
		domesticity. It's the greatest fear 
		that men have who belong to Western 
		Culture. It's centuries old. Like 
		King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
		century who decided one day that he 
		was so bored with his dreary life at 
		home with his wife he thought, "Well, 
		wouldn't it be great if we hit the 
		road and fought... oh... the 
		Saracens."  So he put the word out 
		and was amazed when a million men 
		signed up and all of them wanted to 
		go and fight in distant lands and do 
		terrible things to people rather 
		than stay at home with their families.

				  MARTIN
		So you're saying that Ulysses--
		everything he said to his queen when 
		he came back--everything was a lie? 
		He just wanted to fuck around?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		Mmm.

	Beat.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And how have you been feeling about 
		your... work lately?

				  MARTIN
		Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
		just getting hard to go to work in a 
		good mood. I'm starting to think 
		I've been in the business too long. 
		Last week I did a guy younger than 
		me.

	INT. CHURCH -

	SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

	MARTIN

	From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
	the altar.  A priest in fact.

	MARTIN'S HANDS

	open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
	squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
	returns the chalice to the cabinet.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		The church seems to be purging itself 
		of it's pedophile.

	MARTIN

	Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
	watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
	prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
	altar.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		It's a bull market.

	C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET

	The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
	the ground.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Anyway, that never use to happen. I 
		was always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
		one of the guys.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Maybe some of the discomfort you're 
		feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over 
		the innocent people you've killed.

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				  MARTIN
		If I show up at your door, chances 
		are you did something to bring me 
		there. I don't care about that stuff, 
		anyway.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What stuff?

				  MARTIN
			(dismissive)
		Morality.

	Oatman's glad the session's just about over.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Go to your reunion, Martin. See those 
		people and discover what they mean 
		to you. Try not to kill anybody for 
		a few days, see how you feel.

				  MARTIN
		If I get antsy I'll kill a few small 
		animals.

				  OATMAN
		Now we're making progress.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	Very dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
	what he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
	The cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
	finally coming to a photo album.

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Just a minute.

	INSERT-ALBUM

	A teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
	poses with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
	but her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
	the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
	"IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."

	MARTIN

	turns the page.

	INSERT-PHOTO ALBUM

	A photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
	a bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
	NEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would 
	you rather...?!"

				  CAT
		Meow!

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
	him, moaning hungrily--

				  MARTIN
		Food soon...

	Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
	bottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
	hydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
	and thirty cans of CATFOOD.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna or liver?

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna it is.

	He opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
	the cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
	YEARBOOK. Flips it open....

	INSERT-YEARBOOK

	A picture of a senior class "Blues Brothers" party: a group 
	of teens mug to the camera in Blues Brothers get-ups. 
	Sprinters race for a finish line, their chests stretching 
	for the tape.

	DEBI NEWBERY'S SENIOR PICTURE

	A more mature version of the girl in the album. Her name 
	appears under his picture...

	INT. GROCER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Track light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
	wearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
	vegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
	carrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
	Grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

	INT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Grocer enters the main room of the villa-style A-frame. He 
	moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a COMPUTER.

	ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS

		  "Click OK for remote access caller"

	OK is clicked.

		   "Availability for two days in Detroit area"

				 "Terms"

				"$560,000"

				  "When"

				  "Now"

				"OK/ FAX materials"

	Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a 
	moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
	beeps.

	  "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

	Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
	graphic appears:

		"Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

	Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
	juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

	INT. PLANE - NIGHT

	Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
	on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
	they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
	a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
	he sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

	INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

	At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
	two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
	blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
	crowd.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always say 
		that. I'm telling you, you never met 
		the man.

				  MCCULLERS
		Seventeen months ago I was posting a 
		walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He 
		never saw me. But I saw him, though.

				  LARDNER
		Lisbon?

				  MCCULLERS
		In Portugal, yes.

	In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
	the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
	drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

				  LARDNER
		Here's the news: He hasn't been in 
		Portugal since '90. I know that from 
		the file. Why don't you read the 
		file, man?

				  MCCULLERS
		In fact, I think I talked with him, 
		in Bonn.

	Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always have 
		to know everybody. Why don't I just 
		take the weekend off and let you 
		kill him. Since you two are so close.

	They exit.

	EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

	INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport 
	artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...with highs today in the upper 
		seventies. Related stocks on Wall 
		Street today as scandal continues to 
		rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech 
		Center...

	MARTIN'S CAR

	blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
	eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied 
	by two figures.

	INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE

	are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...An unknown "whistle-blower" has 
		leaked a number of critical flaws in 
		the safety designs of next year's 
		models to authorities that could 
		cost millions in recalls....

	MARTIN

	flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes 
	fascistically.

				  MARTIN
		Mein hero.

	...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon 
	Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.

	EXT. HIGHWAY-

	Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. 
	Dig it...

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar 
	voice....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
			(on radio)
		--this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the 
		time. Oldies from the eighties. It's 
		a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

								   CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH

	lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a 
	microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her 
	face move in front of her mouth as she speaks....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--and I'm ready for some good tunes 
		and angry talk. Or angry tunes and 
		good talk--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the 
	windshield...

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau 
		Twins and get over the goo-angry-
		talking music. As you know--

								   CUT TO:

	THE DEEJAY'S HANDS

	as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the 
	mic.

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--for some moments in life there are 
		no words, and a little nonsense now 
		and then is relished by the wisest 
		man--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district.

								   CUT TO:

	HER MOUTH

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--The Cocteau Twins, though also a 
		band of the nineties, will be aired 
		due to the fact that they created 
		their own language to sing by--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a 
	storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the 
	passenger window....

								   CUT TO:

	DEBI NEWBERRY

	the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive 
	chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window 
	behind it that opens to the street....

				  DEBI
		--Now that's freedom--

	she swivels in the chair to face the street....

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow.

	DEBI

	Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned 
	by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly.

				  DEBI
		--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where 
		are all the good men dead? In the 
		heart or in the head? Back later....

	MARTIN

	Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the 
	street and disappears....

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING

	Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner 
	with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops 
	as he slows and pulls over....

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

	Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then 
	back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car.

	WIDE SHOT

	of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle 
	of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves 
	in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the 
	clerk inside.

				  MARTIN
		What are you doing here?

	CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question.

				  CARL
		A double shift. What's it look like?
			(softening)
		Can I help you with something?

	Martin's head pans the room, processing.

				  MARTIN
		I don't think so.

	EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING

	Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar 
	landscape.

				  MARTIN
			(into phone)
		Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick 
		up if you're there... It's Martin 
		Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not 
		here. My house is gone and now there's 
		a 7-11 here... And that's 
		unfortunate... You can never go home 
		again, Dr. Oatman.

	Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		But I guess you can shop there.

	INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She 
	banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late 
	fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching 
	her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, 
	a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from 
	Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating.

				  NURSE
		Mary, your son's here.

	The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and 
	pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They 
	start out of the room.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, 
	baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes 
	and hacks.

				  MARY
		I bought a new rug.

				  MARTIN
		That's wonderful, Mom.

				  MARY
		What's a revival tent?

				  MARTIN
		It's a place where religious people--

				  MARY
			(knowingly)
		Marlin Perkins and Jim!

				  MARTIN
		Jim?

				  MARY
		His assistant. He acted like Marlin's 
		son, only he wasn't. At least they 
		never said he was... I bet they were 
		lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. 
		Wild Kingdom my ass!

	Mary coughs horribly.

				  MARTIN
		It's good to see you. I'm sure you're 
		curious about what I've been doing.

				  MARY
		I spoke to your father the other 
		day.

				  MARTIN
		I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

				  MARY
		Nature made him then broke the mold.

	Martin decides to change the subject.

				  MARTIN
		They told me you're taking lithium, 
		mom.

				  MARY
		Yes, they give me headaches. I have 
		a headache.

				  MARTIN
		You have a headache?

				  MARY
		I have a headache. You have a 
		headache?

				  MARTIN
		No, I don't have one.

				  MARY
		You don't have a headache. I have a 
		headache.

	Mary leans in close, smiling.

				  MARY
		We had a good laugh, didn't we?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah. I guess we did.

	EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to 
	it.

				  MARY
		Why don't you return this car and 
		borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to 
		the rent-a-car so you can get a ride 
		back.

				  MARTIN
		I think I'll go see Debi today.

				  MARY
		Of course you will.

				  MARTIN
		I can't think of anything to say to 
		her that seems appropriate given I 
		left and never said goodbye to her.

				  MARY
		Take care of her. She's a keeper.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  MARY
		And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro 
		on foreign exchange?

				  MARTIN
		I have always thought about her and 
		missed her.

	A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.

				  MARY
		Separate the wheat from the chaff 
		and you've got the candle cat.

	Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes 
	at Martin, taking him in.

				  MARY
		Remember no matter how impossible 
		your problems feel. I've known people 
		without a chance in the world. And 
		all of a sudden, they have lives.  
		Time allows miracles. Let yourself 
		breathe, son.

	Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse 
	spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is 
	somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once 
	more to connect.

				  MARTIN
		Mom...

	The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks 
	up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel 
	Merman, arms out Broadway style.

				  MARY
		"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ 
		What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ 
		Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt 
		someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ 
		Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ 
		We really mean it!"

	Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.

				  MARY
		Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's 
		your name?

	EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY

	Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of 
	headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...

				  MARTIN
		Hey Pop... You got off easy. The 
		house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
		pharmacological punching bag and I 
		murder for cash. If you were here I 
		think you'd be proud.

	He drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY

	The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. 
	Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs 
	the steel-sided briefcase.

				  MARTIN
		pries out a wall vent, slides in the 
		case and replaces the vent.

	EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of 
	town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger 
	window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his 
	lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings 
	his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...

				  MCCULLERS
		"...Against the wind... just a young 
		man running... Against the wind... 
		let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on 
		it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

	McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. 
	He nudges Lardner, and points.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.

	of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the 
	radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into 
	the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare 
	at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment...

				  DEBI
			(on air, groping)
		WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. 
		Oldies from the eighties. That was 
		ah... the Specials. Doing... one of 
		their songs...

	Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back 
	to turntable A and lets the record roll on.

				  DEBI
		...and here's another.

	Debi swivels around to face Martin.

				  MARTIN
		"Oldies from the eighties?"

	After a long pause....

				  DEBI
		I just play my own collection.

				  MARTIN
		It's nice to see you again.

	Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock.

				  MARTIN
		How long has it been?

				  DEBI
		Since you stood me up on prom night 
		and vanished without saying a word?

				  MARTIN
		Ten years, I think. What I miss?

	Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense.

				  DEBI
		Well, let me see... they tore down 
		the George Orwell monument and put 
		up a bust of George Michael. Main 
		Street's a four-laner, no left turns 
		four to seven. I was married and 
		divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now 
		officially the new sister city to 
		Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have 
		fiber-optic town meetings every two 
		months.

				  MARTIN
		Here is now there. There is here.

	Their eyes lock on each other...

				  DEBI
		Those are the headlines.

	The request line buzzes.

				  DEBI
		Hold that thought.
			(into phone)
		WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, 
		all the...
			(pauses)
		No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

	Beat. Debi makes the move.

				  DEBI
		Tell me about yourself.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in California most of the time. 
		Traveling a lot on business. That's 
		about it, really.

				  DEBI
		That's it?

				  MARTIN
		Not much else.

				  DEBI
		What's your business?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  DEBI
		Professional killer. Do you get dental 
		with that?

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I'm in town for a few days, 
		anyway.

	They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. 
	Martin gets the fear, breaks it off.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

				  DEBI
		Okay.

	Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin steps out of the storefront station along the 
	fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the 
	middle of the street with a strained look on his face.

	INT. LARDNER & MCCULLERS' COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	LARDNER & MCCULLERS' P.O.V.

	of Martin standing in the street.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	They frown, wondering at Martin's next move.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi lost in thought, still. After a moment, she sits upright 
	and flips the "ON-AIR" switch.

				  DEBI
			(into mike)
		A man comes to you. He is from the 
		past bringing you pain long since 
		put behind you. He says peculiar 
		things and leaves abruptly. It all 
		comes flooding back...

	EXT. STREET -

	Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes 
	determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi broadcasting...

				  DEBI
		It felt like an apparition, or some 
		cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time 
		warp I'd been thrust back into without 
		warning. There's a strangeness in 
		the air and I don't mind telling 
		you, I'm a little spooked. He was a 
		man from my past. A man I loved. A 
		man who disappeared.

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin walking back into the station.

				  DEBI
		A man who's walking back into the 
		station.

	Martin comes into the booth. The temperature rises as they 
	square off.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE -

				  LARDNER
		Well?

				  MCCULLERS
		I don't think so.

				  LARDNER
		Well, remember when Frysal's men 
		paid off the Deejay in Cairo to 
		announce a bogus press conference in 
		the --

				  MCCULLERS
		--Nooo--

				  LARDNER
		--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in 
		'72. A local radio station started 
		broadcasting news of the massacre 
		two minutes before it happened.

	McCullers is not to be outdone.

				  MCCULLERS
		That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

				  LARDNER
		It was the PLO.

				  MCCULLERS
		Whatever.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH

	Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace. They break 
	away.

				  DEBI
		Sit.

	Martin obeys. Debi clandestinely flips the "ON-AIR" switch 
	as she drops into her chair. The "ON-AIR" light bar goes on 
	above and behind Martin. Unbeknownst to him their conversation 
	is put out over the airwaves.

				  DEBI
		All right mystery man. I want some 
		answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. 
		Two young lovers with frightening 
		natural chemistry. The girl sits in 
		a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at 
		her father's house waiting for the 
		most romantic night of her young 
		life. The boy never shows up, until 
		now. So, what's the question?

				  MARTIN
		Where have I been?

				  DEBI
		More like what happened? What 
		happened, Mr. Blank?

				  MARTIN
		I don't know exactly. I could venture 
		a guess but it would sound like a 
		rationalization... I thought you 
		know... maybe seeing you, some 
		friends, my house... of course now a 
		7-11--

				  DEBI
		--Torn down in the name of convenience--

				  MARTIN
		--and I guess, sure, seeing you would 
		be part of that whole equation... I 
		suppose the most important thing, 
		really. I don't know. Anyway, this 
		whole thing's my therapist's idea. 
		It's my shrink, really.

				  DEBI
		Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

				  MARTIN
		You see someone?

				  DEBI
		Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade 
		later, and you want to sort things 
		out with me. The question now is, do 
		I allow you... access... to my being?

	Martin says nothing.

				  DEBI
		All right then. Would you like to 
		share any more deeply personal 
		thoughts with our listening audience 
		before we go to our phone poll and 
		see how the folks in radioland come 
		down on this one?

	A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to 
	bolt.

				  DEBI
		Should a broken-hearted girl give a 
		guy a second chance at love....

	Debi jabs a phone line on the console.

				  DEBI
			(HARD)
		You're on the air.

	Martin deflates.

				  OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
		I think this young man has avoided 
		the question completely. Has not 
		discussed "what happened" nor if 
		he's sorry for what he has done. 
		Therefore, I don't see any reason 
		why you should see him until he fully 
		discloses his intentions and feelings.

				  DEBI
		Thank you caller.

	Stabs another line.

				  DEBI
		You're on the air.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Are you there?

				  DEBI
		Yes.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		No, the guy.

	Martin looks up, humiliated.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah....

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Uh... when you guys use to go out... 
		Did you guys ever... heh heh heh 
		heh... ever fuckin', ever totally 
		fuckin' heh heh heh-

				  DEBI
		Next caller.

				  GUFF MAN VOICE
		I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad 
		gas to me. I would not allow him 
		access to your being.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  DEBI
		Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you 
		loud and clear: "If you love something 
		set it free. If it comes back to you 
		it's, well...

	She turns to him and shrugs apologetically.

				  DEBI
		...Broken...."

	Martin has his answer.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.

				  MARTIN
		Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

	He scans the main strip.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, 
	forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats 
	and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. 
	Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he 
	remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.

	FELIX'S P.O.V.

	As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, 
	and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches 
	their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that 
	they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His 
	P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark 
	sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet 
	away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...

	Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....

	THE MAN

	pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is 
	PAUL SWIDERSKI.

	MARTIN AND PAUL

	Martin relaxes.

				  PAUL
			(grinning ear-to-ear)
		Hell, I would've voted for you, but 
		there's all this apple sauce stuck 
		in my phone... I don't wanna talk 
		about it. How the hell are you?!
			(extends his hand)
		Here's five good ones!

	No trace of recognition on Martin's face.

				  PAUL
		Marty! It's me. Paul.

				  MARTIN
			(realizing)
		Paul?

				  PAUL
			(re: hand)
		You're leaving me hanging here...

	They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the 
	respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.

				  PAUL
		Hey. Give me a break.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY

	Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide 
	streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on 
	golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly 
	Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a 
	joint.

				  PAUL
		This won't take but a minute. I just 
		gotta hold their hands for a final 
		walk-through. I'll take them in, get 
		'em out, then you and I can grab a 
		little quality time.

	Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.

				  PAUL
		Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was 
		afraid you joined a cult or something. 
		I half-expected you to come back to 
		town in a fennel wreath and paper 
		pants.

	Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.

				  MARTIN
		There was no money in it.

	Martin regards Paul archly.

				  MARTIN
			(grinning)
		So what happened to you?

				  PAUL
		Same thing that happened to you-- I 
		stopped poutin' there on the 
		sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.  
		I joined the working week, you slick 
		fucking asshole, so why don't you 
		valet park your high horse and take 
		it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

				  MARTIN
		Fair enough.

	Beat.

				  PAUL
		God it's great to see you.

				  MARTIN
		You too.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized 
	Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were 
	different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is 
	hawking the house to them out of earshot.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
		Well, we do what we have to do if we 
		find you on the property. But we 
		don't really enforce the law, we 
		execute company policy for homeowners.

	MARTIN AND THE GUARD

	standing in the driveway.

				  MARTIN
		So when are you authorized to use 
		deadly force?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, a 'course, taxes provide your 
		basic service-- police and whatnot. 
		But our customers need a little more 
		than just that, you understand? This 
		badge doesn't mean that I am a peace 
		officer.

	The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.

				  MARTIN
		So it's not a meaningful symbol, or 
		anything. That badge is just the 
		badge of your company. If I look 
		suspicious on your customers' property--
		well, under those heightened 
		circumstances you have the authority 
		to, ah... To shoot me.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		To shoot you. Correct.

				  MARTIN
		How did you get this job?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, they were hiring, and it was 
		only a two week course...

				  MARTIN
			(pleasantly)
		Wow.

	Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.

				  PAUL
			(to couple)
		...What more can I say.

				  HUSBAND
			(smiling)
		We'll talk soon.

				  PAUL
			(much hand gesturing)
		You'll be raising your new family in 
		a work of art. A work of art in a 
		work of art.

	Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the 
	sell.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		I'm sure you'll be very happy.

	All look to Martin....

				  MARTIN
			(heartfelt)
		When my time comes, if it ever does, 
		I want a beautiful, normal place 
		like this... and a wife like you...

	All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

				  MARTIN
		...and you'll be safe here...

	Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE

	Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house 
	in the distance.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER

	Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming 
	neighborhood.

				  PAUL
		Now. I don't make a habit of pimping 
		my friends, but there is one prime 
		little piece of land that you must 
		see...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and 
	winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the 
	house.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi's house.

				  PAUL (V.O.)
		Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

	C.U. OF MARTIN

				  MARTIN
		No. You drove us here.

				  PAUL
		Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, 
		isn't it?

				  MARTIN
		No.

	Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of the mansion.

	They roll slowly by Debi's house.

	They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to 
	the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

				  PAUL
		Ten years. What happened!?

				  MARTIN
		I freaked out, joined the Army, worked 
		for the government, and went into 
		business for myself... I'm a 
		professional killer.

				  PAUL
		Thank you.

	Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

				  PAUL
		Professional killer, huh? Does that 
		come with a good HMO?

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The 
	sign above it says

		  "DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

				  MARTIN
			(looking ahead)
		He sells BMW's?

				  PAUL
		He sold me this bad boy.

				  MARTIN
		How could you put your hard-earned 
		dollars into the hands of the class 
		bully?

				  PAUL
		He gave me a great deal.

				  MARTIN
		Mein Dealer.

	Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
	looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing 
	up amidst his stable of expensive cars.

				  PAUL
		Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

				  BOB
			(dismissive)
		Glad to hear it.

	Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.

				  MARTIN
			(shouts)
		Bob...

				  BOB
			(turning)
		What?

				  MARTIN
		It's me. Martin Blank.

				  BOB
		Really...? So what?

				  MARTIN
		Okay. See you later.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward 
	his own. Paul calls after him.

				  PAUL
		See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
		a-man-made-good party.

	Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.

	MARTIN

	stands across the street from the radio station, looking at 
	Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from 
	his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE

	of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the 
	beat of an unheard song.

	MARTIN

	dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.

	INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

	Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at 
	his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban 
	teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video 
	game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still 
	working the double, nods to Martin.

				  CARL
		Can I help you?

				  MARTIN
		What's done is done.

	Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a 
	pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the 
	counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into 
	a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
	bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

	FELIX

	Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.

	MARTIN

	grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom 
	of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.

	CARL

	grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his 
	hands up.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Plays on.

	FELIX AND CARL

	Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward

	MARTIN

	Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking 
	out each freezer door behind him.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped 
	store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the 
	counter, sending Martin diving out of view.

	MARTIN

	pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now 
	two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on 
	Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, 
	spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can 
	take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's 
	left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.

	Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious 
	to the surrounding carnage.

	CASHIER ISLAND

	Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves 
	to Carl.

	CARL

	is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and 
	finds

	A BOMB

	under the corpse.

	MARTIN

	Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the 
	counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the 
	Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--

				  SKATEBOARDER
		What the fuck, man?!

	The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. 
	The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of 
	the double doors.

	EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

	The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is 
	peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive 
	and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb 
	and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi 
	looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking 
	Heads plays in the studio.

				  MARTIN
		Are you going to the reunion?

				  DEBI
		No. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
		here?

				  MARTIN
		That's part of it.

				  DEBI
		Well, you'll have a ball. You seem 
		to have everything everybody wants 
		when they go back. The car, the suit, 
		the watch. The look. That just leaves 
		the little things, like happiness, 
		character, point of view...

				  MARTIN
		It's always the little things.

				  DEBI
		Yep.

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		I'm wondering how you've been. How 
		you are. I'd like to catch up with 
		you. If it's possible.

	Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

				  MARTIN
		Well, there's not much to tell.

				  DEBI
		I'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
		in the last ten years. You've had 
		experiences.

				  MARTIN
		Bad experiences.

				  DEBI
		You met people.

				  MARTIN
		Bad people.

				  DEBI
		Watched television?

				  MARTIN
		Bad television.

				  DEBI
			(amused)
		Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
		sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

				  MARTIN
		What's that?

				  DEBI
		It's a swift spiritual kick to the 
		head that alters your reality forever.

				  MARTIN
		That'd be good.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		What do you want?

	The question is open.

				  MARTIN
		I figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
		around seven o'clock.

				  DEBI
		Let me get this straight, are you 
		asking me out?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Unbelievable.

				  MARTIN
		Seven it is.

				  DEBI
		I'll think about it.

	EXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

	Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
	a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
	Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
	s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
	her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
	boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
	finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
	the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
	Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

				  MONTY
		Baby, it's eight o'clock.

	Marcella gets up.

				  MARCELLA
		Thanks, Monty.

	She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

	INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

	Marcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

				  MARCELLA
		Hey there, how'd it go?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

	Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

				  MARTIN
		It isn't done.

	Marcella pauses, taking this in.

				  MARCELLA
		This is not good.

				  MARTIN
		I'll do it tomorrow.

	Marcella considers this.

				  MARCELLA
		What's it look like?

				  MARTIN
		It's fine.

				  MARCELLA
		You haven't looked at the dossier.

				  MARTIN
			(a little defensive)
		I've looked at it.

	Martin eyes the vent.

				  MARCELLA
		You have.

				  MARTIN
		Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
		remarkable about it at all.

				  MARCELLA
		I have to call the client and give 
		them a reason why you're late.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them my house exploded.

	Beat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

				  MARCELLA
		I'll call them and tell them you're 
		taking your time. Being a 
		professional.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
		you could find out why they double-
		booked the job, and who is trying to 
		kill me, and call me back-- that's 
		be great.

				  MARCELLA
		Will do.

	Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
	get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
	briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
	He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
	in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

	BRIEFCASE

	We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
	envelope and is about to tear the seal when

	THE PHONE RINGS

	Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

				  DEBI
			(filtered)
		Are you there?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Pick me up at my father's house at 
		around seven. And don't be late this 
		time.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		Hello...?

				  MARTIN
		This night, this reunion will be an 
		important step in our relationship.

				  DEBI
		You're fucking psycho.

				  MARTIN
		Don't rush to judgement until all 
		the facts are in.

	She hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
	turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

	GUNS, BULLETS, ETC.

	What has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
	to him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
	case to its hiding place.

	EXT. DINER - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
	across the street.

				  MCCULLERS
		I wish he'd do his job already so we 
		could do our job.

				  LARDNER
		We can't do our job unless he does 
		his job.

				  MCCULLERS
		Why don't we just do his job then, 
		so we can do our job, and get the 
		fuck out of here.

				  LARDNER
		Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
		killer.

				  MCCULLERS
		Wait a minute--

				  LARDNER
		-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
		but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
		a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
		then you come in and kill the Bad 
		Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

				  MCCULLERS
		So if we do his job, we're the bad 
		guys. If we do our job, we're the 
		good guys.

				  LARDNER
		Yup.

	They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
	caught short by the sight of

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV

				  GROCER
		moving into the diner.

	INT. DINER - LATE MORNING

	Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
	into an apple juice and looking out the window.

	GROCER

	slides into the booth, across from Martin.

	MARTIN AND GROCER

	Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
	levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
	drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
	breakfast stand-off.

				  GROCER
		Easy, tiger.

	A waitress approaches.

				  WAITRESS
		Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
		name is Melanie and I'll be your 
		server this morning. Let me tell you 
		about some of our specials. Today we 
		have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
		feature omelette. And there's our 
		"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
		you're in the mood for something 
		different there's the "I left my 
		heart in San Franchezie."

	Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

				  GROCER
		I want two eggs poached, hash brown 
		well-done. English muffin for the 
		bread. And a coffee.

				  MARTIN
		Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
		white omelette.

				  WAITRESS
		What would you like in the omelette?

				  MARTIN
		Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
		all.

	The waitress nods pertly and leaves.

				  GROCER
			(re: the omelette)
		Come on, live a little. I'm sorry 
		about the incident yesterday.

				  MARTIN
		No harm no foul.

				  GROCER
		A little misunderstanding among my 
		associates.

	Beat.

				  GROCER
		I told them to kill you and they 
		didn't.

				  MARTIN
		Hard to get good help these days.

				  GROCER
		But since we're both here, I think 
		it's time to take a fresh look at 
		our relationship.

				  MARTIN
		I didn't get into this business to 
		have "associates." And I don't want 
		to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
		" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
		own." That's the whole point. Why 
		don't you become a cop, or something. 
		You can drink coffee in the morning... 
		with friends!

	Grocer looks a little hurt.

				  MARTIN
			(easing up)
		Look, this is a one-on-one business... 
		Every time you get to know people, 
		bad things happen. If it'll make you 
		feel any better, this is my last 
		job. So what do you say we put our 
		guns away and forget the whole damn 
		thing.

	Grocer loses it.

				  GROCER
		Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
		everything's regulated!

	Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

				  MARTIN
		No deal.

				  GROCER
		Fine. But we're not going to let you 
		do your job. Because we're gonna do 
		it. And then, after we do your job, 
		we're gonna do another little job...

				  MARTIN
			(Wry)
		Is that right?

				  GROCER
		Yeah-- after I shoot you through the 
		fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
		in the bullethole.

				  MARTIN
		Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

	INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
	it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
	a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

				  MARTIN
			(trying on smile)
		Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
		couch insurance. I test-market 
		positive thinking. I lead a weekend 
		men's group, actually. We specialize 
		in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
		you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
			(sarcastic)
		Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
		I'm not married, I have no kids and 
		I'd blow your brains out if someone 
		paid me enough... So how've you been? 
		Where do you stand on The Issues? 
		Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
		shamed, blahblahblahblah--

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

	Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
	holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
	steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

				  DEBI
		Flowers. That's funny.

				  MARTIN
		As long as I get the laugh.

				  DEBI
			(taking them)
		Here. Let me put these in some rubbing 
		alcohol.

	She backs into the house, and he follows.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this 
	atavistic ritual.

				  MARTIN
		You look beautiful.

				  DEBI
		Okay... Hold on...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
	MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
	Barcolounger.

				  DEBI (V.O.)
		...Let me get my coat.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

	DEBI

	moves up the stairs and disappears.

	MARTIN

	looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
	den.

	INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

	Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
	He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
	hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
	Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Good evening, Mr. Blank.

				  MARTIN
		How are you? How's business?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Martin, I don't know where you've 
		been since you abandoned my daughter 
		ten years ago, and I don't care. It 
		was good that you left, and I'm glad 
		you did. So what do you want to talk 
		about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
		I had you figured wrong.

				  MARTIN
		How's that?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		I visualized you, in a haze, as one 
		of the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
		coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
		seeing in Newsweek.

				  MARTIN
		I took the other road. I'm more of a 
		self-reflective young lion who does 
		business with lead-pipe cruelty and 
		goes home to drink light beer in 
		milky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
		and sex and have no real relationships 
		with anyone. And you?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
		same old sell-out baby-boomer, 
		exploiting the oppressed I got shot 
		for at Kent State. But why don't we 
		have a drink and forget the whole 
		thing?

	Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

				  MARTIN
		Why not?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		So what are you doing with your life 
		now, son?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		That's good.

	Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

				  DEBI (O.S.)
		Okay

	Mr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE

	Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.

	INT. CAR - DUSK

	Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
	Martin is a widening pool of quicksand.

				  MARTIN
		Do you want to get a drink first?

				  DEBI
		I think they'll probably have booze 
		there.

				  MARTIN
		Right.

	Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
	it tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
	a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just be a second.

	Debi nods, a little confused but going with it.

				  DEBI
		Okay...

	EXT. PAYPHONE - MINUTES LATER

	Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
	conversation.

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
		someone tried to kill me and the guy 
		in the middle got killed. So if I 
		see that guy again I'm definitely 
		going to kill him, but I won't kill 
		anyone else. Oh, except for the guy 
		I was sent here to kill. I don't 
		know...

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

	Oatman treats his patient.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What else? Say more.

				  MARTIN
		Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm 
		on my way to the reunion.

	In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the 
	station.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Okay. Repeat this after me.

				  MARTIN
		Out Loud?

	Martin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr. 
	Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back.

				  MARTIN
		...I am at home with the me. I am 
		rooted in me, who is on this 
		adventure.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Take a deep breath and realize, that 
		this is me breathing.

				  MARTIN
		This is me breating.

	Martin takes in a few breaths.

				  MARITN
		Alright, look. I gotta go.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And don't kill anyone.

				  MARTIN
		Right. Don't kill anyone...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Felix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the

	NIGHTSTAND

	The reunion invite.

	FELIX

	picks it up and scans it.

	EXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

	Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch 
	Martin and Debi pull into a space.

				  LARDNER
		He's falling for her. Look at him.

				  MCCULLERS
		He using her.

				  LARDNER
		You're wrong. Look at his face.

				  MCCULLERS
		One cannot love and kill.

				  LARDNER
			(defensive)
		I love. I kill.

	MARTIN AND DEBI

	climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
	his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
	himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		Shoulda brought my gun.

				  DEBI
		What?

	He pulls himself off the car and heads toward

	GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL

	A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
	is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
	A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
	nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
	and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

				  ARLENE
		Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
		Joseph.

				  MARTIN
		I'm Martin Blank.

				  DEBI
		Debi Newberry.

	Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
	Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
	say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

				  ARLENE
		Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

				  MARTIN
		Don't say that.

	Arlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
	have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
	uncomfortably.

				  ARLENE
		We had pictures put on, that way 
		everybody knows who everybody was!

				  MARTIN
		Wonderful.

				  ARLENE
		So, what are you doing now?

				  MARTIN
		Whatever I can get away with.

	She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
	next arrival. Martin moves off...

				  ARLENE
			(to the next person)
		Isn't it cute. It's so everybody 
		knows who everybody was!

	He circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
	stops at the open bar.

				  BATENDER
		What can I make you?

				  MARTIN
		Beer.

	The bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
	the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Ken. How have you been?

				  KEN
			(glancing at Martin's 
			name tag)
		Hello Martin. How have you been?

				  MARTIN
		Not bad. You?

	Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
	contact is made.

				  KEN
		Hello, Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Bob.

	Bob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
	conversation.

				  KEN
		I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
		& Fromeyer.

				  MARTIN
		That sounds pretty interesting...

	Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

				  KEN
		Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
		Some property. Some personal injury.

				  MARTIN
		Those all seem kind of related...

	Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
	go.

				  MARTIN
		Tragedy makes you thirsty.

	Ken chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
	grabs it and begins to move off.

				  MARTIN
		Well... I have to take this over to 
		Debi.

				  KEN
		Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
		here's a special one. For top-shelf 
		clients.

	Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
	business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
	puts it in his kerchief pocket.

				  MARTIN
		Thanks.

	Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

	MARTIN

	makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
	emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
	Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
	Martin.

				  TERRY
		I don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
		people, driving me crazy. Look at 
		them over there, memorializing old 
		times, acting all like it was 
		something "life-changing." And the 
		people in the National Honor Society? 
		The name tags?

	Martin shrugs.

				  TERRY
		They have special blue starts on 
		them like it fucking matters now 
		that they were in the honor club ten 
		years ago. I'm getting fucking 
		nauseous from all this sentimental 
		bullshit. It's making me sick.

	Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
	man's nametag.

				  MARTIN
		Why are you here... Terry?

	Terry turns on a dime.

				  TERRY
		I wanted to see a couple people. But 
		I don't want to talk about the old 
		days... What did we have together, 
		Martin? Typing?

				  MARTIN
			(remembering)
		Drafting.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking 
		class. But I appreciate you helping 
		me out, man.

				  MARTIN
		Don't mention it.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try 
		and get out of here, man. I'll see 
		you later.

	Terry slinks off.

	BAR - SAME

	Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
	to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
	KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

				  DAN
		Bob. Bob Destephano.

				  BOB
		What?

				  DAN
		I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

				  BOB
		Computer guy.

				  DAN
		Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's 
		dealership the other day.

				  BOB
		I sell BMW's. What do you do?

				  DAN
		Not much, actually. My software 
		company just went public so I'm 
		just... hanging out, really.

	There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his 
	drunken hand at relating...

				  BOB
		Remember high school?

				  DAN
		Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us 
		up in the grandstands?

	Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks 
	off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.

	INT. GYM - LATER

	Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
	in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
	arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
	is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
	out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
	Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
	stop sports conversation.

				  MIKE
		...You gotta hold the fans 
		responsible, though, Dennis, because 
		they're the ones putting up with the 
		mediocre product.

				  DENNIS
		I guess, though, you know, if you 
		look at it Mike, that park is a 
		beautiful park, I've gone to that 
		park many times - I've had the 
		greatest time of my life at that 
		ballpark and let's face it, I tell 
		you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, 
		if you're having the fun you should 
		be having at Tigers Stadium, you 
		don't even know what the hell's going 
		on anyway...

	They both crack up at this.

	ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI

				  DARIUS
		Have you two been together since 
		high school?

				  DEBI
		No--

				  MARTIN
		--Yes. Actually we just bought that 
		little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine 
		Avenue... Debi's a social worker and 
		I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

				  DEBI
		We haven't seen each other since 
		high school.

				  DARIUS
		I figured. You two look too happy 
		together. I shouldn't say that though, 
		I'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
		you up to these days? What do you do 
		for a living?

	Debi perks up; this should be interesting.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in pro-active international 
		relations. It's a very specialized 
		company. We execute economic 
		investment opportunities. Sort of 
		economic clean-up... with an emphasis 
		on personnel. It's boring, you know, 
		it's boring. I don't like to talk 
		about it because I don't think what 
		a man does necessarily reflects who 
		he is...

	Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
	Martin may be in trouble.

				  MARTIN
		...I've always tried to refrain from 
		a black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
		know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
		been more interested in the gray 
		areas.

	Silence. Martin pushes on.

				  MARTIN
		But that's no way to live. I guess 
		you've got to just take the leap of 
		faith. Believe in something. Fuck 
		it.

				  DARIUS
		Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you 
		happy?

				  MARTIN
		I just have to close this one last 
		account. I'd like to just stop now, 
		today, but I can't... It's a step in 
		the right direction.

				  DEBI
		I don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
		you're feeling compromised. Live the 
		way you want. The only thing that's 
		inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
		That's the biggest cop-out there is.

	Nods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
	and then...

				  AMY
		But wait. I still don't understand 
		what you do.

				  MARTIN
		I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

	Debi suppresses a laugh.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		Yes I do.

				  AMY
		You don't...

				  MARTIN
		In the corporate offices.

				  AMY
		Oh... really?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  AMY
		What do you do?

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits to the Southland.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		It's what I do.

				  AMY
		You're so funny...

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits and gravy all over 
		the Southland--

				  AMY
		--Stop it--

				  MARTIN
		You know those horsey biscuit gravy 
		packets? I move all of those--

				  AMY
		--No.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's 
		and just change them to special 
		barbecue sauce.

	Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

				  DENNIS
		What do you think about black coaching 
		in the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
		it's great.

				  DARIUS
		I don't pay much attention to 
		football.

				  MIKE
		I have to agree with you Dennis. 
		It's good to see that the owners are 
		willing to put the franchise behind 
		a black head coach or QB when for 
		years in the league they've been 
		kept out of the thinking positions 
		and relegated mainly to the physical 
		game.

				  DENNIS
		But now, you see, you have Warren 
		Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art 
		Shell, and the coach up at 
		Minnesota...

				  MIKE
		Dennis Green. And if you remember, 
		Doug Williams was the first black 
		man to prove that on a Superbowl 
		Sunday.

	Amy leans in to Martin.

				  AMY
			(to Martin)
		I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior 
		High School.

				  DENNIS
		...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand 
		on this whole Louis Farrakhan 
		issue...?

				  DARIUS
			(facetious)
		I'm a De Klerk man myself.

	Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.

				  DEBI
		I'm going over to play some tunes.

	Martin watches her walk away.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - LATER

	Dan Koretzky sits with two other FORMER-SQUARES-turned-
	handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with 
	early investment in Microsoft.

	Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. 
	He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back.

	GROUP OF MEN

				  DAN
		Look at her. There it is. Jenny 
		Slater. The finest thing that ever 
		walked these halls.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		I believe she married the state of 
		Maine.

				  DAN
		Yeah, he's around here somewhere. 
		What a shame. She would have looked 
		great in my fucking Bentley.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only 
		was she as fine, if not finer, than 
		Slater, but she had the "bad girl" 
		thing going for her. And the red 
		hair. C'mon.

				  DAN
		She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti 
		was the finest. No question about 
		it.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. 
		All named Jenny...

				  DAN
		You know what I'm really hoping? 
		That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And 
		she's twenty-eight--

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		--she's got half the state of Maine--

				  DAN
		She's twenty-eight years old, with 
		two kids, she's still really really 
		fine, and I see her at a bookstore 
		or something, and she sees me for 
		what I was then, and what I am now: 
		the redemption for all her failure.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		You mean the redemption for all your 
		failure.

	They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating 
	on Debi.

	BOB DESTEPHANO

	Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER

	Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay 
	booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric 
	game.

				  DEBI
		Which would you rather...?

				  MARTIN
		Okay... Would you rather... commit 
		yourself sexually to a four-by-nine 
		cell with former President George 
		Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a 
		super-model for a month, or make 
		love to a otter on crank for a week?

				  DEBI
		Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, 
		clearly! I'd let the little beast 
		scratch and claw all he wants... 
		Okay. Would you rather make love to 
		the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

				  MARTIN
		--She's not dead---

				  DEBI
		It's just a game...! Alright. Candied 
		Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest 
		across the desert with a fully 
		digested crab apple in your mouth?

				  MARTIN
		Wow. I have to give this some thought.

				  DEBI
		No time.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

	STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified 
	and unsure at what she's heard.

				  STACEY
		Marty! Debi! How are you! So many 
		people came, but I never expected to 
		see you Marty. Or you Debi... I 
		mean... because of what your 
		divorce... I didn't mean to say that. 
		I just meant you look so good.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  STACEY
		Do you think you could play "Too 
		Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

				  DEBI
		Stacey, why don't you come up here 
		and take over for a little while?

				  STACEY
		I'd love to.

	Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as 
	Martin and Debi make their way down.

				  DEBI
			(to Martin)
		Everybody thinks they know me now 
		that I'm divorced.

	She leads Martin toward the exit.

				  DEBI
		It's time to see you in private.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together.

				  MARTIN
		Even though I left, you never left 
		me. Not just memory but a substance 
		in my blood.

				  DEBI
			(smiling)
		Like heroin?

				  MARTIN
		Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

				  DEBI
			(enjoying this)
		Like love?

				  MARTIN
		Could be. The physical substance of 
		love.

	Debi stops.

				  DEBI
		I'll accept that. Follow me.

	Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, 
	and close the door behind them.

	INT. NURSE'S OFFICE

	Martin and Debi make wild banshee love.

	EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.

				  MCCULLERS
		Looks like someone keeps trying to 
		do our job for us.

				  LARDNER
		If he does our job, he's our job.

				  MCCULLERS
		I get it.

	INT. GYM - SAME

	FELIX

	steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into 
	the crowded gym. He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer 
	combo, with no nametag. He's clearly too old for the class 
	of 1984.

	INT. HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-
	coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't 
	You Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
	tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
	that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
	Martin, something must be done about it.

				  DEBI
		I'll be right back....

	Debi kisses him. They split up. Martin walks off, the happiest 
	we've seen him....

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a 
	drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal 
	that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite 
	a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
	from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
	continuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
	Martin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
	the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
	classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
	echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
	gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
	back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
	ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
	and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
	holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
	grinds it into dust in his hand.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music 
	changed for the better.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Martin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
	Destephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
	slightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
	leans into Martin

				  BOB
		So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that 
		shit again?

				  MARTIN
		Fine, Bob. How are you?

				  BOB
		Never better.

				  MARTIN
		Really?

	Bob crumbles.

				  BOB
		Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing 
		adds up to nothing... you work your 
		whole life, day in and day out-- try 
		to make sense of it all. One day 
		you're twenty-seven and what do you 
		get to show for it...

				  MARTIN
		You could've been a contender, huh?

	Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without 
	the use of cliches.

				  BOB
		Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how 
		smart you are with my foot up your 
		ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

	Martin steps to Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Why would you want to hit me, Bob? 
		Do you really believe that there's 
		some stored up conflict that needs 
		resolution between us? We don't exist. 
		There's nothing between us. So who 
		do you want to hit, Bob? It's not 
		me.

	Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated.

				  BOB
		What am I gonna do?

				  MARTIN
		What do you want to do?

				  BOB
		I want to be an actor.

				  MARTIN
		Then express yourself, Bob.

	Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself.

				  MARTIN
			(catching him)
		Be honest...

	Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, 
	then stops abruptly, and smiles.

				  BOB
		Later, Martin.

	Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin 
	watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the 
	doors of a stairwell, disappearing.

	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the 
	stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her 
	but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
	quickens her pace up the stairs...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
	relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
	from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
	a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
	withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
	the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
	his attacker--

	FELIX

	impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
	of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
	stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
	sound. His eyes lock onto

	DEBI

	who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees.

	MARTIN

	looks back at

	FELIX

	Dead.

	THE FLOOR

	A growing pool of blood.

	MARTIN

	Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. 
	Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming

		 "SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

	MARTIN

	rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
	Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
	shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over 
	each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. 
	He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
	hall, and bangs through the doors.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands 
	looking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found. He scans 
	the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the 
	one in Oatman's office. In the middle of the floor, Terry 
	slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes.

	MARTIN

	pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall.

	INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it 
	over his shoulder.

	INT. STAIRWELL - A MINUTE LATER

	Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow. Martin bounds down the 
	steep steps with his load.

	INT. BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM HALLWAY - MINUTE LATER

	Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him. He kicks 
	through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on 
	casters and begins rolling.

	INT. PUMP AND FURNACE ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

	The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind 
	Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops 
	next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses 
	and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses 
	into the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar 
	and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace. A 
	white-hot blaze roars within.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	The party is winding down. A harried-looking Martin walks in 
	and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing.

	MARTIN'S POV

	of the Deejay booth. It is empty.

	He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge. He motions 
	to the bartender who opens a beer for him.

				  MARTIN
		Have you seen Debi Newberry?

				  KEN
		Nope.

	They both look around at the last of the reunion.

				  KEN
		The more things change, the more 
		they Goddamned well stay the same.

				  MARTIN
		I guess.

	Before Ken can get started again...

				  MARTIN
		Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks 
		for the pen.

	Martin walks out of the gym.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

	Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.

				  PAUL
		What the hell happened to you?

				  MARTIN
		I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

				  PAUL
		As long as you had a good time.

	Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.

				  PAUL
		What now? Chase the girl?

	There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.

				  MARTIN
		It didn't work out.

				  PAUL
		That's too bad.

				  MARTIN
		I have to get my head back into my 
		work.

				  PAUL
		Work's good for the soul.

	Martin gets up to leave.

				  MARTIN
		When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

				  PAUL
		See you in ten years.

	Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better 
	of it.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT

	Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.

	MARTIN PULLS

	THE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the 
	contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and 
	dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock.

				  MARTIN
		Dumb fucking luck...

	THE CONTENTS

	include various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with 
	Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official-
	looking papers including credit reports, medical records, 
	etc... Newberry's life.

	He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
	He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
	toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
	body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
	gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
	door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

	Debi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm.

				  DEBI
		He was trying to kill you, right!

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Not the other way around...?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DEBI
		Is it something you've done?

				  MARTIN
		It's something I do...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...Professionally...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...About five years now.

				  DEBI
			(stunned)
		Get the fuck outta here.

				  MARTIN
		Seriously, when I left, I joined the 
		Army and took the service exam. They 
		found my psych results fit a certain 
		profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" 
		would be the best way to describe 
		it... I was loaned out to a CIA-
		sponsored program. It's called 
		"mechanical operations." We sort of 
		found each other...

				  DEBI
		You're a government spook?

	Martin says nothing.

				  MARTIN
		I was, but no... yes... I was before, 
		but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, 
		really. The idea of governments, 
		nations, it's mostly a public 
		relations theory at this point, 
		anyway. But I'll tell you something, 
		until about five months ago, I really 
		enjoyed my work.

				  DEBI
		Jesus Christ!

				  MARTIN
		Then I started losing my taste for 
		it. Which usually means your time is 
		up. But then I realized it was 
		something entirely different... I 
		started getting the sneaking, dark 
		suspicion that maybe there was... 
		meaning to life.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Great, Martin, that's just 
		great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

				  MARTIN
		Like, that there's a point? An organic 
		connection between all living things.

				  DEBI
		Let me help you along, Martin. You're 
		a sociopath!

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		A sociopath kills for no reason. I 
		kill for money.

				  DEBI
		You never could have kept this from 
		me.

				  MARTIN
		I was leaving.

				  DEBI
		That's probably a good idea.

				  MARTIN
		Will you come with me?

				  DEBI
		I'm staying here.

				  MARTIN
		What if I come back?

				  DEBI
		I'll hide.

	She goes for the door.

				  MARTIN
		Don't go.

	She stops at the door. Slowly, she turns.

				  DEBI
		You don't get to have me. You are a 
		monster, I'm a human being. We're 
		not going to mate.

				  MARTIN
		You don't understand...

				  DEBI
		That's because I speak human, and 
		you speak monster.

	Debi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone.

	Martin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he 
	walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a 
	cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently 
	singing to himself...

				  MARTIN
		"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's 
		up Doc, are you lookin'...?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN

	Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking 
	up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the 
	bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, 
	checking their bores and actions...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING

	Lardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the 
	last of many clips...

	EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING

	Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off 
	onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. 
	They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin 
	loading...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and 
	knock the slides...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. 
	He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops 
	and looks himself in the mirror before exiting.

	EXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT

	Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...

	INT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT

	Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
	and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
	pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of 
	paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of 
	"Women Who Run With the Wolves."

				  MARCELLA
		I'm bringing down the office now.

	She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. 
	It's cathartic.

	INTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR -

				  MARTIN
		I'll put things right. Then I'll 
		find you.

	Silence on the line.

				  MARCELLA
			(apprehensive)
		Uh... why?

	Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier.

				  MARTIN
		Don't worry. I left you a little 
		something under your desk.

	Martin hangs up.

	Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink-
	wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so.

				  MARCELLA
		All right!!

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR

	Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the 
	distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, 
	away from him.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching 
	Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares 
	to blow Newberry's head off.

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME

	As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, 
	he accelerates.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry.

				  GROCER
		Oh shit...

	EXT. ROAD - SAME

	Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing 
	down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.

	INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

	Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
	the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
	swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
	to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
	Newberry opens the passenger door.

				  NEWBERRY
		What the fuck is the matter with 
		you?!

				  MARTIN
		Well, I was hired to kill you. It's 
		what I do, and come to think of it, 
		I told you that, but... Okay. I'm 
		not going to do it. Get in the car.

	He does. They drive on.

				  MARTIN
		It's either because I'm in love with 
		your daughter, or because I have a 
		new-found respect for life. Or both. 
		But I don't know.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and company watch in amazement.

	GROCER'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded 
	driveway.

				  GROCER
		That punk is either in love with 
		that guy's daughter or he has new 
		found respect for life... Let's go.

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
	and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
	shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

				  NEWBERRY
		Why? I build cars! They're paying 
		you to kill me? Why?

				  MARTIN
		It was a cost-cutting effort. They 
		can't afford a recall.

				  NEWBERRY
		It was a leaky sunroof! A design 
		flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! 
		You want to kill me because of that?

				  MARTIN
		It's not me! Why does everybody think 
		it's personal?!

	They go through the front door and shut it behind them.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within 
	viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into 
	the driveway.

				  LARDNER
		We'll go in through the woods.

	INT. NEWBERRY HOUSE

	Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
	contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
	Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
	Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
	Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was sitting in my house on prom 
		night wearing that Goddamned rented 
		tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
		bottle of champagne in the other. So 
		I was just sitting there, and then 
		the whole night flashed before my 
		eyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
		in the head-- I realized, finally, 
		and for the first time, that... I 
		wanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
		because I loved you so much, that'd 
		it'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
		you anymore. But now I'm different.

	He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
	shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
	door.

	Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
	Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
	Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
	Debi. They stop at what they see:

	NEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.

	As ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
	Martin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
	kit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
	their guns rising up fast toward us.

	Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
	it. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
	outside.

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
	A barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
	back behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
	comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
	the cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

				  MARTIN
		I'm in love with you. I know we can 
		make this work!

	MARTIN

	rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
	range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
	steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
	SHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
	the Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
	kitchen.

	NEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH

	Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
	is beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
	at Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was afraid to commit to a 
		relationship, but now I know I'm 
		ready to make it happen.

	Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
	be the wrists.

				  MARTIN
		I just need time to change.

	He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
	stairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
	another ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

	HALLWAY

	He leads them quickly.

				  MARTIN
		It's not easy for me. I was raised 
		to close off, to control my 
		feelings...

	He takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
	coming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
	Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
	through the doorway.

				  MARTIN
		Lock the door.

	They do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
	straight.

				  MARTIN
		I wasn't raised in a loving 
		environment.
			(beat)
		But that's not an excuse. It's a 
		reason.

	INT. FOYER

	Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
	stairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

				  MARTIN
		My soul was empty--

	Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
	Grocer beginning to slip in.

				  MARTIN
		--and it's up to me to fill it.

	Martin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
	slide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
	hears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
	tossing the spent weapon.

	INT. BEDROOM

	An ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
	Debi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
	The Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
	the line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
	Assassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

				  MARTIN
			(through the door)
		It's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
		to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

				  MARTIN
		I know what I do isn't moral, per 
		se, but if you could just look past 
		that, you'd see a man worth loving.

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		Don't listen to him, he's a 
		professional.

	Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
	voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		You're breaking my heart down here, 
		Blank. I can't shoot through the 
		tears.

	Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
	man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
	firefight...

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
	about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

				  LARDNER
		Did you see Blank in there?

				  MCCULLERS
		No...

				  LARDNER
		Good. For a second there I thought 
		we were in trouble.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	MARTIN

	reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
	up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
	FIRE, when they hear...

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
	ala Butch and Sundance.

	Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
	FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
	out of view.

	KITCHEN - INTERCUT

	GROCER

	heads up the back stairs.

	MARTIN

	works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
	kitchen.

	GROCER

	hears him and starts back down.

	Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
	out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
	Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
	crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
	air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
	room, still firing.

	C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION

	The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and 
	the slide on the auto locks back-- empty.

	NORMAL SPEED

	GROCER

	Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
	serving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
	that sits on a lazy susan.

	MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

	Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
	side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
	the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
	counter above and between them.

	Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

				  GROCER
		...How about I sell you two rounds 
		for a hundred grand a piece?

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

	Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
	into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

	BALLED CHECK

	sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
	Grocer's head and into his lap.

				  MARTIN
		There you go. I left it blank.

				  GROCER
		Excellent. Here they come.

	Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
	and pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
	BULLETS into the air.

	MARTIN

	rises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
	BULLETS sail past his head.

	GROCER

	begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
	gun.

	MARTIN

	puts all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
	and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

	GROCER

	gets off one round before

	MARTIN

	flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
	over his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
	landing on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

	GROCER

	Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
	picture tube. He is dead.

	MARTIN

	runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
	discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
	edge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
	his arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
	into the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

	MARTIN AND NEWBERRY

	MARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
	it into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
	Martin looks past Newberry.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	Of Debi, head in hands.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi... will you marry me?

	Debi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head 
	still down, and closes the bathroom door...

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Outside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, 
	bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...

				  DEBI
		This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry 
		cause that's what it does. Bringing 
		you New Ones for the Nineties, a 
		fresh new format designed to pull 
		you out of what's come before, and 
		reel you into what's coming soon--

	THE PHONE CONSOLE

	lights up with an incoming cal...

				  DEBI
		I tell you what's coming soon for 
		me, or at least what I dreamed this 
		morning in that weird time just before 
		you actually wake up. But first this 
		commercial. Back after this...

	She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, 
	and answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio 
	monitor:

				  ANNOUNCER
		Don't miss the show of the season at 
		Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" 
		A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," 
		starring Carol Plummer, Thomas 
		Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee 
		Ordman!...

	Debi picks up the phone.

				  DEBI
		RFN...

	Her face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... 
	Then she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of 
	dead air, then she snaps to.

				  DEBI
		Hey out there... Okay... I'm going 
		to finish up that fantasy later. 
		First I'll give you an hour of nonstop 
		music... If I don't come back on 
		after that-- well, nevermind.

	Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but 
	stops dead when she sees

	MARTIN

	sitting on the front steps.

	Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the 
	porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. 
	After a while...

				  DEBI
		This will never work out.

	She turns to him, serious.

				  DEBI
		You kill people.
			(beat)

				  MARTIN
		I have no illusions about the future. 
		What is, is. We make choices. And we 
		become the sum total of our choices. 
		I can live with that.

				  DEBI
		Other people can't.

	Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly. 
	She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same. 
	They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...

								   THE END
